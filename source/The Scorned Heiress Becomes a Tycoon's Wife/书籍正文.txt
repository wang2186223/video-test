###Chapter 1

"Ms. Laurent, your blood test confirms you're four weeks pregnant."

Sophia shot up from her chair, the screech of metal against tile piercing the sterile air.

Her gaze locked onto the doctor's lips as if sheer willpower could erase the words just spoken.

"That's impossible!"

The doctor adjusted his glasses and slid the lab report toward her. "HCG levels don't lie."

Her fingers trembled as they grasped the flimsy paper.

She'd never been intimate with anyone—not even Ethan Winston, her boyfriend of three years. Their relationship had never progressed beyond holding hands.

A shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

"Sophia, Ethan's birthday party started thirty minutes ago. Where are you?"

The call dragged her memory back to that corporate gala a month ago.

She'd been blackout drunk. Ethan had escorted her to the hotel.

Could that night—?

Laughter boomed through the VIP lounge atop Westmount Club.

Sophia pushed open the door just as Ethan licked frosting from Isabella's cheek, his arm draped around her waist.

The room fell silent.

"Look who decided to show up," someone sneered.

Ethan barely glanced up. "Don't get the wrong idea. We're just friends."

A high-pitched ringing filled Sophia's ears.

"See? You mean nothing to him," a redhead taunted. "If you weren't so clingy—"

The shatter of crystal cut through the mockery.

Burgundy liquid dripped from Ethan's hair onto his designer shirt.

"Are you insane?" Isabella scrambled to blot his face with napkins.

As Sophia turned, fragments of conversation chased her:

"Who does she think she is? She'll come crawling back within days."

"Everyone knows she can't survive without him."

The hallway walls felt like ice against her palms.

She'd forgotten to ask about that night.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen.

This child couldn't have come at a worse time.

Chandeliers blazed in the Lowell mansion's grand foyer.

Sophia stepped inside to hear Emily's saccharine voice: "Mother, the bird's nest soup works best when warm."

Under the crystal glow, the family tableau looked perfect—until Richard set down his teacup.

"The Valdemars are pressing for the marriage. Alexander is vegetative. Emily can't marry him. You will."

Sophia's grip tightened on her handbag strap.

The once-formidable CEO of Valdemar Holdings now lay motionless in a hospital bed.

And her father was throwing her into that gilded cage.
###Chapter 2

Sophia Laurent felt nothing but bitter irony.

Her life had diverged completely from Emily Lowell's at age thirteen. They should have returned to their rightful places, yet the Lowell family insisted on keeping their adopted daughter.

Emily was sent to Patriarch Lowell for elite upbringing, while Sophia—the true biological daughter—became an outsider in her own family.

"The Valdemar marriage contract will always belong to Emily." Those were the first words she heard upon returning to the Lowells.

Now that Alexander Valdemar lay in a vegetative state, suddenly they remembered her?

"Do you think just anyone can climb into the Valdemars' good graces?" Richard Lowell slammed the table. "If not for Patriarch Lowell's past favors, this opportunity would never fall to you."

Sophia's lips curled into a cold smile. "If it's such a golden opportunity, why not send your precious Emily?"

"You—!" Richard's face darkened.

Victoria Lowell immediately shielded Emily. "Sophia, how can you be so cruel? Emily was raised delicately. She's not as... resilient as you."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly.

Resilient. Before thirteen, she'd gutted fish and chopped meat at the wet market for her adoptive parents, her hands perpetually chapped. In freezing winters, she'd scrubbed the family's laundry in icy water until her fingers turned raw.

And Emily? Playing piano in silk pajamas, basking in central heating.

"Does Fourth Brother think I should marry?" Sophia turned to Nathan Lowell, the entertainment industry's top idol.

Nathan's face twisted in disgust. "Even diminished, the Valdemars are aristocracy. Don't be ungrateful."

"A healing marriage?" Sophia scoffed. "Who still believes in that superstitious nonsense?"

"Sophia!" Richard thundered. "You know exactly what shape Lowell Entertainment is in! Without the Valdemars' support, we're finished!"

Sophia clenched her fists.

She knew better than anyone. As William Lowell's shadow strategist, she'd built Lowell Entertainment's success. Now that William's recklessness had backfired, she was expected to clean up the mess?

"Aunt Margaret's condition..." Richard suddenly softened his tone. "The Valdemars have the world's top medical team."

Sophia's breath hitched.

Margaret Clementson was the only one who'd ever shown her kindness. After the accident two years ago, Margaret had remained in a vegetative state.

"I'll marry." The words scraped from her throat.

Her parents' faces lit with triumph.

"On one condition." Sophia lifted her pale face. "I want three percent of Lowell Entertainment's shares."

The room plunged into silence.

Emily suddenly burst into tears against Victoria's shoulder. "Don't trouble yourselves, Mama, Papa. I'll—"

"Absolutely not!" William pulled Emily into a protective embrace, glaring at Sophia. "Must you torment Emily at every turn?"

Sophia studied their hypocritical expressions and laughed.

"No shares? Then let your precious daughter perform the healing marriage."
###Chapter 3

The Lowells wanted the Valdemar family's influence but refused to sacrifice their precious Emily. Since when did the world work that way?

Sophia had single-handedly rescued Lowell Entertainment from bankruptcy. The profits she generated far exceeded that measly three percent stake.

Silence fell over the living room after her declaration.

Victoria Lowell frowned. "Why do you need shares? Haven't we provided everything for you?"

Nathan Lowell scoffed. "Ungrateful wretch. Eyeing the family fortune already?"

Daniel Lowell studied Sophia with quiet intensity.

William Lowell adopted a conciliatory tone. "Sophia, those shares will come to us eventually. Why rush?"

Richard Lowell smiled ingratiatingly. "We're family. You'll always be taken care of."

Sophia's lips curled at his hypocrisy.

"No shares, no deal."

Today they'd force her into a therapeutic marriage. Tomorrow they'd sell her out completely.

When she first returned to the Lowells, they'd treated her decently.

That changed quickly.

Every action was twisted into an attack on Emily. One pout from their darling, and Sophia became the villain. Explanations meant nothing.

Perhaps blood ties couldn't compete with years of shared history.

She'd grieved that truth yet still craved their affection.

Now she understood how pathetic that hope had been.

Richard softened his voice. "The Valdemars are elite aristocracy. Even if Alexander is comatose..." He hesitated. "You'll always be family. Your position at the company is secure."

Sophia laughed softly.

Still trying to manipulate her with empty promises?

"I'll marry after the shares are transferred."

She turned toward the stairs.

"Sophia!" Victoria shattered a teacup. "I always knew adopted children never truly belong!"

Nathan sneered. "She's been like this from the start. That permanent scowl of hers—"

Daniel watched Sophia's retreating figure, an odd tightness in his chest.

William sighed. "That attitude is unacceptable."

Richard remained silent.

Emily spoke gently. "Father, Mother, perhaps I should—"

"Absolutely not!" Victoria cut in. "The Valdemars are in chaos right now."

Alexander wasn't the only heir.

With him comatose—rumored vegetative and physically impaired—those he'd suppressed were circling like vultures.

Marriage to him now meant jumping into hellfire.

Richard patted Emily's hand. "Your career is blossoming. We'll convince your sister."

——

Sophia's room occupied the north-facing corner of the third floor—a former storage space, she'd overheard.

Her original bedroom had adjoined Emily's, flooded with sunlight. Until Emily complained the music room was too far.

She didn't care.

This was still better than the hovel Emily's birth parents had kept her in.

William entered without knocking, wearing his practiced smile.

"We don't want to force you, but Patriarch Valdemar personally requested this marriage—"

Sophia nearly gagged on his duplicity.

"Don't want to force me? Or can't bear to sacrifice Emily?"

William cleared his throat. "Emily's at a critical career stage. Marriage would—"

"The engagement was between Alexander and Emily. Did Patriarch Valdemar agree to substitute me?"

"Not explicitly."

The old man had simply demanded the marriage proceed, offering concessions.

"Technically, you were Alexander's intended first. Emily... came later."

Sophia stared before bursting into laughter.

"When I first returned, you all warned me never to covet Alexander. That the Valdemar matriarch position belonged to Emily."

William adjusted his collar. "Circumstances have changed."

Her stomach turned.

How could they voice such shamelessness so plainly?

When Alexander thrived, Emily claimed the engagement.

Now that he'd fallen, they shoved Sophia forward without pretense.

The truth was simple—the Lowells never saw her as human.

And she'd been foolish enough to call them family, even helping Nathan at his cruelest.

Perhaps her derision showed too clearly.

William averted his eyes. "Think it over. This marriage benefits everyone."

He fled.

Nathan lounged in the doorway. "Waste of breath. She's always been a viper."

Unlike Emily, who lived for the family.

Without Emily refining his composition, would he have achieved fame?

"Alexander's practically a corpse. She gets the Valdemar name. What's there to refuse?"

William sighed. "She has her reasons."

Nathan snorted. "Reasons? More like throwing a tantrum after Ethan dumped her."
###Chapter 4

The entire Lowell family took turns confronting her.

Threats, bribes, verbal abuse, and honeyed words—nothing could sway Sophia's resolve.

Victoria trembled with rage. "What sin did I commit to raise such a heartless creature?"

Even Christopher interrupted his filming to call. "Will marrying into the Valdemars kill you? Stop pretending to be noble!"

Richard played the benevolent patriarch. "The shares will be yours eventually. Transferring them now would destabilize the company..."

Sophia remained firm.

Either the shares or Emily could marry.

Cornered, the Lowells finally relented.

The Valdemars were pressuring them to secure this advantageous match.

When Sophia received the share transfer documents, she felt hollow inside.

The familial love she'd yearned for had always been an illusion.

Richard offered a saccharine smile. "The shares would've been yours anyway. Come home if the Valdemars mistreat you..."

Empty words.

Sophia's lips curled coldly. "Unnecessary."

Her gaze shifted to the Valdemar car waiting outside.

"Consider these shares my bride price."

Scanning their hypocritical faces, her voice turned icy.

"Don't contact me again."

Nathan exploded first. "As if we'd want to!"

Sophia nodded calmly. "Then we're severed."

She turned and walked away without looking back.

The Lowells exchanged stunned glances.

Nathan stomped his foot. "Who does she think she's threatening?"

Victoria looked devastated. "Was bringing her home a mistake?"

Daniel watched the departing car with inexplicable unease.

Richard scowled. "Utterly disgraceful."

William remained composed. "She'll come around eventually."

Victoria nodded. "Without the Lowells, she's nothing."

The Valdemars skipped wedding formalities.

Sophia was brought directly before Patriarch Valdemar.

The elderly man wore a stern expression in his traditional suit, though exhaustion lined his features.

"You're one of us now. Henry will show you around."

Henry Chamberlain was Alexander's assistant.

"This way, Mrs. Valdemar."

On the sanatorium's second floor, Sophia saw Alexander.

The man lay motionless in bed, his sculpted features pale as marble.

Full-body casts and medical equipment cocooned him.

Sophia's breath caught.

She'd glimpsed Alexander at a gala once—radiant, surrounded by admirers.

Now...

Henry discreetly withdrew.

Alone in the sterile room, Sophia approached the bed.

"I'm Sophia Laurent. Your wife in name only."

Her voice softened unconsciously.

"I know this isn't what you wanted. We'll divorce when you wake."

Machines beeped rhythmically.

Studying his still form, unexpected pity stirred within her.

Richard's call interrupted the moment.

She stepped out to answer.

"At the Valdemars?"

"Yes."

"Return to the office immediately. Work is piling up—"

Sophia nearly laughed.

"Labor laws grant marriage leave. I'm taking my annual vacation too."

"Preposterous!" Richard spluttered. "What about the company?"

"Not my concern." Her tone turned flippant. "Shall I resign?"

Instant backtracking.

"Don't be rash. The chief secretary position is yours permanently."

"Rest today. Report tomorrow without fail."
###Chapter 5

Richard Lowell's voice carried a false warmth. "You're now a company shareholder. Our interests are aligned, aren't they?"

Sophia Laurent let out a light chuckle. "We'll see."

She ended the call and scrolled through her contacts.

"Chairman Huang, interested in a business discussion?"

"How about some shares in Lowell Entertainment?"

After hanging up, Sophia set her phone down, her gaze icy.

Her delicate features radiated detachment.

The Lowell family no longer deserved her attention.

Since severing ties, she wouldn't let them benefit from her in any way.

Inside the CEO's office at Lowell Entertainment.

"The project proposal for Valdemar Group is with Secretary Laurent."

"Secretary Shaw hit a snag with the Deepwater Plaza negotiations. The investors are pulling out..."

"Only Secretary Laurent has the complete market research data for White Cloud District..."

William Lowell massaged his temples as reports flooded in.

"Retrieve the bidding plan for the Valdemar project from Sophia's computer. We need it tomorrow."

Once hailed as a rising star in business, he now felt overwhelmed for the first time.

"Wasn't the Deepwater Plaza investment a done deal? What went wrong?"

"The White Cloud report must be on my desk by end of day."

The secretaries exchanged uneasy glances.

"Mr. Lowell, the timeline is too tight..."

His cold stare silenced them. "Then work overtime."

They retreated with grim expressions.

Paperwork piled up, making William dizzy.

He suddenly recalled how Sophia used to organize everything—all he had to do was sign.

Another knock interrupted.

"Mr. Lowell, the Valdemar project plan isn't on Secretary Laurent's computer..."

"What?"

William shot to his feet. "The bidding is tomorrow!"

"The project team has a draft, but Secretary Laurent rejected it..."

"Get out." He took a deep breath.

Dialing Sophia's number, he demanded, "Send me the Valdemar bidding plan."

His tone brooked no argument. "Father already told you, right? Be at the office early tomorrow."

Sophia twirled a pen between her fingers, amused. "Mr. Lowell, my resignation letter is in your inbox."

"Have you lost your mind?" William's voice rose. "You got the shares. What more do you want?"

"They were rightfully mine." Her voice could freeze hell.

"Fine, they're yours." Impatience laced his words. "Stop this nonsense."

Sophia gazed out the window, serene. "William, the Lowells and I are done."

The line went dead.

Silence echoed in the office.

William stared, disbelief etching his face.

How dare she?

Without the Lowells, she was nothing.

Wait—who would handle all this work now?

He redialed, only to hear: "The number you have reached is not in service."

His phone slammed against the sofa.

Minutes passed before he snapped back to reality, forehead damp with sweat.

Tomorrow's bid determined Lowell Entertainment's future. Failure wasn't an option.

Elsewhere, Sophia set her phone aside and addressed the young man across from her. "Proceed."

"But Ms. Laurent, didn't you previously abandon the Valdemar project?"

Her lips curved slightly. "That was before."

Back when she'd still harbored hope for the Lowells.

"The timeline's impossible, and the funds—"

"Funding isn't an issue." Her tone remained unruffled.

Luxury cars crowded the Valdemar resort project bidding venue.

William had barely entered when greetings came.

"Mr. Lowell, good morning!"

"Mr. Yang."

The man glanced behind William. "No Secretary Laurent for such an important event?"

William's expression darkened.

"She's just a secretary."

Forced pleasantries continued until movement at the entrance caught his eye.

His pupils contracted.

A slender figure strode in.

Black attire, crimson lips, cascading ink-dark hair.

Sophia Laurent.

William first brightened, then sneered.

Playing hard to get?

She came crawling back after all.

Relief flooded him, though disdain painted his face.
###Chapter 6

William Lowell's gaze cut through the crowd, landing squarely on Sophia Laurent. The tension in his shoulders eased imperceptibly.

"Isn't that your secretary?" Mr. Yang followed his line of sight. "I thought she wasn't coming."

"She insisted." William's lips curved slightly. "Couldn't be stopped."

"You're fortunate to have such—"

"Just an ordinary assistant." William dismissed the compliment, yet his feet carried him toward Sophia.

He adjusted his tie, waiting for her to approach him first.

He'd forgive her willfulness this time.

But discipline was necessary.

Sophia drew nearer.

William straightened his posture instinctively.

Then watched, stunned, as she walked right past him without acknowledgment.

He cleared his throat pointedly.

Sophia had noticed William the moment she entered. The forced cough didn't even make her hesitate.

"Sophia!" William's voice turned glacial.

She remained expressionless. The young man beside her turned. "Something you need, Mr. Lowell?"

William finally registered Oliver Granger's presence. The rising star of Pearl Group.

"This conversation doesn't concern you." William's tone dripped with disdain. Pearl Group was nouveau riche in his eyes.

"Joining Pearl Group, Sophia?" He sneered. "Really?"

She turned with a faint smile. "Problem?"

Pearl Group had always been her creation.

William's face darkened. "Have you lost your mind? Abandoning your family's legacy to lick someone else's boots?"

"Mr. Lowell," Sophia's crimson lips curved, "the bootlicker here isn't me."

The Lowells had bled her dry while offering no respect.

William caught the implication. "Remember who your real family is."

"My family," Sophia's smile deepened, "is my husband."

"You—"

William trembled with rage. "Without the Lowells, you're nothing!"

"Then watch closely." Sophia strode toward the bidding venue.

William stared after her, chest tight. Something vital was slipping from his grasp.

The bidding commenced. Mr. Yu of Linyuan Group took the stage. "Our goal is to develop a premier resort..."

Companies presented proposals in turn. Lowell Entertainment went early.

William kept glancing at Sophia, who never looked back. Normally she prepared his speeches—today he floundered alone.

Mr. Yu's disinterest was palpable.

William sat down frustrated. Sophia remained unruffled.

When Pearl Group's turn came, all eyes fixed on her.

In a tailored black suit with her hair elegantly pinned, she commanded the room.

"We propose a family-themed resort." Her clear voice carried. "The hot springs can be developed into a hotel with adjacent children's facilities..."

Mr. Yu's eyes brightened.

William's gut twisted. He'd never seen Sophia shine like this.

The worst part? This should have been Lowell Entertainment's proposal.

"Mr. Lowell," Mr. Yang whispered, "I thought your secretary was here to assist you."

William's face darkened.

"Wish Pearl Group would take me." Mr. Yang added fuel to the fire.

"Get lost." William's glare burned into Sophia. Tonight, he'd drag her home.

The entire family would witness his rebellious sister's betrayal.
###Chapter 7

The bidding hall was thick with tension.

The general manager of Roland Group stood at the podium, surveying the room.

"After careful deliberation by the review committee—"

His gaze finally settled on Sophia Laurent. "Pearl Group has won this project."

Amid thunderous applause, William Lowell crushed the documents in his hand.

His burning glare locked onto Sophia, fury radiating from every pore.

This project was vital to Lowell Entertainment's survival—yet Sophia had snatched it away.

Sophia rose gracefully, her red lips curving.

"Thank you for Roland Group's trust."

Her voice rang clear. "Pearl Group won't disappoint."

After the meeting, business elites swarmed around her.

Sophia handled their probing questions with effortless poise.

"Sophia!"

William pushed through the crowd, his face dark.

"Tell Mr. Chamberlain you submitted the wrong proposal." He hissed through clenched teeth. "This is your last chance."

A light laugh escaped her.

"William, you amuse me." She smoothed her sleeve. "My proposal was flawless."

Veins bulged on his forehead.

"Have you forgotten your family name?"

"Oh, I remember." Sophia adjusted her cuff. "It's you who's the outsider now."

William's face turned ashen.

"You think Pearl Group can save you?"

He spat the words. "I'll ruin your reputation in this industry."

Sophia turned, her red dress swirling.

"We'll see."

She walked away without a backward glance.

William kicked over a potted plant, drawing shocked stares.

Meanwhile, in the VIP lounge of Cloudcrest Mall...

Victoria Lowell held court among society matrons.

"Isn't that necklace a limited edition?"

"I heard you need a million-dollar purchase history just to qualify!"

Their envious glances pleased Victoria.

She touched the diamonds at her throat delicately.

"My children spoil me."

Pride warmed her voice.

"William runs the company brilliantly. Daniel won at Paris Fashion Week. Christopher's latest film grossed over a billion..."

The women murmured admiration.

"And Emily just landed another blockbuster, didn't she?"

"Such accomplished children!"

Victoria's smile faltered slightly.

"Though..."

She sighed. "There's one who causes nothing but trouble."

The women exchanged knowing looks.

"That wild girl could never compare to Emily."

"Honestly, you're better off cutting ties."

Victoria sipped her tea, masking her disgust.

"Let's not dwell on that."

She changed the subject smoothly. "Who's attending the charity gala next week?"

As chatter turned to luxury brands, no one noticed the figure slipping away from the corner.
###Chapter 8

Every word from Lu Changsheng struck Elder Qian like a blade.

The Kirin clansmen stood rigid, their faces ashen, eyes burning with barely contained fury. Two of the Violet Flame Generals finally snapped, roaring as they charged at Lu Changsheng.

To Lu Changsheng, their movements unfolded like a slow-motion reel—each frame crisp and deliberate. With effortless grace, he deflected their attacks, fingertips barely grazing them.

Their bodies plummeted like broken kites, blood painting vivid arcs in the air.

Elder Qian exhaled heavily, his Kirin form dissolving. Drenched in blood and pallid, he rasped, "Your power rivals even the Guardian Beasts of the Chaos Realm. Yet never before has a human of your strength walked this earth."

Lu Changsheng replied coolly, "Longevity doesn’t equate to omniscience. Some masters prefer to remain untouched by mortal affairs."

Elder Qian fell silent, lost in thought. The setting sun bathed the ruins in crimson as he finally lifted his head. "We will submit. But the Kirin Clan demands the most favorable terms."

"Elder!" Qi Chuan cried out, aghast. "Bowing to humans? What of our dignity?"

Lu Changsheng cut in, "Specific terms require deliberation among all four Beast Clans."

News of the upheaval spread like wildfire across the Beast Continent. Some raged at the clans' surrender, while others watched the chaos unfold.

Three days later, representatives of the four clans gathered in Kirin territory.

"The Vermilion Bird Clan already has a new leader?" The Qiongqi Patriarch sneered.

The former Vermilion Bird Elder replied mildly, "The young must inherit their due."

The White Tiger Patriarch smirked. "Never thought the proud Kirin would bend the knee."

The Kirin leader shot back, "Better than being tossed around like a ragdoll before surrendering."

As arguments threatened to shake the roof, Lu Changsheng entered with Xu Yeming in tow.

"You handle this." Lu Changsheng nudged his disciple forward before taking a seat.

The moment Xu Yeming opened his mouth, the Kirin leader scoffed. "A whelp like you dares sit among equals?"

"Fetch your master!"

"Come back in ten thousand years!"

Lu Changsheng didn’t even glance up. "Am I dead? Need another beating?"

His disciple was his to discipline. Anyone else? They’d regret it.
###Chapter 9

Sophia Laurent's bank card had been used by Victoria Lowell for two years straight. She'd never bothered to calculate the exact amount.

At most, she'd assumed it was two or three million. Nine million was impossible.

Victoria hesitated. Sophia's icy voice cut through the silence.

"The statement has been sent to your phone. Feel free to verify it."

Victoria's expression froze. "Let's not dwell on that now," she said awkwardly. "Just unfreeze the card so I can pay."

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

For the first time, she saw through the Lowell family's glamorous facade to the ugliness beneath.

"Mrs. Lowell, what makes you think I'd pay for you?"

Victoria choked before rallying. "I gave birth to you! Your money is mine by right!"

Sophia nearly laughed.

"Shall I refresh your memory?"

She turned toward the window, her voice dropping colder. "I was sent to Emily's family right after birth. They kept accounts from when I was six. Raising me until thirteen cost them seven thousand three hundred."

"At thirteen, I returned to the Lowells. Five years cost you seventeen thousand—including Emily's hand-me-downs."

"After college, I never took another cent from you."

Victoria frowned. "Your father didn't provide for you?"

She distinctly remembered her husband giving each child an allowance.

Sophia tapped the documents. "Freshman year, Emily 'lost' a necklace. You all decided I stole it."

"What does that have to do with money?"

"You cut off my allowance. Said it would resume when I confessed. Forgotten already?"

Victoria finally recalled.

Back then, she'd been too busy comforting Emily to remember.

"How was I supposed to know he actually stopped it? You should've spoken up if you needed money!"

Sophia nodded. "It's insignificant. But Mrs. Lowell, helping yourself to nine million of my money seems inappropriate, no?"

Once, she'd craved their love. That vulnerability had made her easy prey.

Victoria fell silent.

After a long pause, she mumbled, "Let bygones be bygones. Just pay for me now."

Sophia stared.

She laughed softly. "Victoria Lowell, where's your shame?"

The documents were tossed aside.

"The days of considering you family are over."

Her voice rang clear and cold.

"I'm severing ties with the Lowells."

When she cared, they were family. Now, they were just parasites.

A smirk curled Sophia's lips.

"Go ask your four sons and precious daughter..."

Let's see how much their beloved Emily can spare.

Victoria brightened. "They're far more capable than you—"

Sophia laughed outright. "Go collect then."

The call ended.

Oliver Granger, Pearl Group's CEO, asked gently, "Everything alright?"

"Perfect."

Sophia met his gaze. "Contact legal. I'm filing for misappropriation of assets."

Victoria stared at her disconnected phone, livid.

First priority: securing payment.

She dialed William Lowell, her eldest and most powerful son.

"Darling, I found some lovely things. Wire me some money?"

William, fresh from losing his temper at a bidding war, forced calm. "Of course."

Victoria hung up cheerfully.

The notification popped up: $10,000.00.

"What?"

She redialed immediately. "Ten thousand won't cover anything! Send three million!"

William paused. "How much?"

"Three million!"

"..."

"Where are you? This isn't some scam, is it?"
###Chapter 10

"Just transfer the money. Why all the questions?" Victoria Lowell's impatient voice crackled through the phone.

William Lowell's brow furrowed. "Mother, I don't have that much liquid cash right now."

Three million wasn't pocket change. Though his assets far exceeded that amount, liquid funds were another matter.

"What do you mean?" Her voice turned icy. "You won't even spare this small amount?"

If Sophia Laurent could produce three million as a mere secretary, surely the CEO of Lowell Group had funds available.

William took a deep breath. "Let me transfer three hundred thousand first. Maybe postpone the purchase—"

The line went dead.

William stared at the darkened screen, his expression stormy. Suppressing his anger, he still transferred the three hundred thousand.

"To the office, Mr. Lowell?" The driver asked cautiously, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.

William massaged his temples. Suddenly, Emily Lowell's gentle smile flashed through his mind.

"To Lowell Entertainment."

Only Emily could lift his mood now.

Meanwhile, Victoria immediately dialed her second son after hanging up.

Daniel Lowell was a renowned fashion designer whose haute couture brand Versini Couture enjoyed prestige in elite circles. Every new collection arrived at her doorstep first, much to her social circle's envy.

"Mother?" His calm voice answered.

"I need three million for some jewelry. Transfer it immediately." Victoria demanded bluntly, acutely aware of the watching eyes around her.

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Daniel?" Her voice sharpened.

"I can send six hundred thousand now." He measured his words carefully. "Perhaps Father could—"

"For jewelry!" Her voice rose. "Just do as I say!"

"I'll transfer what I have." He paused. "You should ask Father for the rest."

Though established in design circles, his liquid assets were limited.

Victoria's expression darkened, but recalling William's meager three hundred thousand, she softened slightly. "Fine. Send it now."

After hanging up, her mood remained volatile. Calls to Christopher and Nathan went unanswered—one filming on location, the other preparing for a singing competition.

Gritting her teeth, Victoria dialed Emily.

The line rang endlessly before connecting.

"Mother?" Emily's voice flowed like honey, sweet and coaxing.

"Darling, I'm short one point five million for some pieces. Could you help?" Victoria's tone turned saccharine.

Emily nestled against William's chest in Lowell Entertainment's photo studio. She bit her lip, meeting his concerned gaze before looking down.

"Of course, Mother. I'll arrange it immediately." Her voice remained dulcet, though her expression tightened after hanging up.

"William, I'll need to borrow from friends..." She made to rise from his embrace.

"Nonsense!" He pulled her back. "I won't have you borrowing money."

Emily worried her lower lip. "But Mother—"

"You're too kind for your own good." William sighed, reaching for his phone. "Let me handle this."

He transferred the remaining one point five million—his last available liquid funds.

"Thank you, William!" Emily's eyes sparkled like a kitten receiving cream.

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Transfer it to Mother now."

Neither noticed the figure outside the studio window, quietly raising a phone to capture their intimate moment.

"Miss Lowell, you were right. The show's just beginning." A message with attached photos sent silently into the digital ether.
###Chapter 11

The photos from the private investigator made Sophia Laurent's lips curve slightly.

She had long noticed Emily Lowell's ambiguous behavior with the Lowell brothers. After severing ties, she immediately arranged surveillance.

Victoria Lowell always praised Emily as a proper lady from a noble family.

What would she think upon seeing these photos?

"Good work. Keep monitoring."

Sophia saved the photos and locked her phone screen.

The timing wasn't right yet. These pieces of evidence needed to wait.

After sending Oliver Granger back to Pearl Group, she headed straight to the sanatorium.

The Valdemar family affairs were complicated. After the wedding, everyone became occupied.

When she left Alexander Valdemar's hospital room to meet shareholders that day, no one even questioned her whereabouts.

Henry Chamberlain, Alexander's secretary, had called to show her the marital home, but she declined citing work commitments.

With the company just taken over, she simply stayed at the office.

Now that the bidding was over, she could finally visit Alexander and inquire about the chief physician's schedule.

The Valdemar Sanatorium had a tranquil environment with tight security.

Surprisingly, the guards let her through without question.

Pushing open the hospital room door, only the hum of medical equipment broke the silence.

The afternoon sun was blocked by heavy curtains.

Sophia yanked them open.

The blood-red sunset illuminated the entire sky, instantly brightening the room.

She stretched her neck and approached the bed.

Alexander remained as she first saw him - encased in plaster, tubes everywhere.

His pale face, the only visible part, was breathtakingly handsome.

Dragging a chair over, Sophia sat and stared at his thick lashes.

"Alexander, can you hear me?"

No response.

She sighed. "If anything happens to you, all that hard-earned empire will benefit others."

The man on the bed didn't move.

Sophia remembered the cold, decisive Valdemar patriarch from before.

Ruthless in business, unapproachable at parties.

Countless socialites pursued him, yet none could get within three feet.

Now this unattainable flower lay quietly in a hospital bed.

Almost unconsciously, she poked his cheek.

Snapping back to reality, she quickly withdrew her hand.

Turning, she met a security guard's shocked gaze at the door.

Sophia: "..."

She expected surveillance, but not this blatant.

Defiantly, she glared back.

The guard averted his eyes.

Embarrassment fading, she poked Alexander's cheek again.

"Alexander, if you don't wake up, the Valdemars will undergo drastic changes."

Pre-marriage investigations showed Alexander's situation was worse than hers.

At least the Lowells occasionally remembered familial bonds.

Except for Patriarch Valdemar, the entire family saw Alexander as a thorn in their side.

"I heard the Patriarch consulted a master at Red Leaf Temple, who said my birth chart could bring healing..."

Sophia relayed what she'd heard from Richard Lowell.

"Resorting to metaphysics - does that mean modern medicine has failed you?"

Her eyes suddenly brightened.

"Let's make a deal. Can I borrow Dr. Whitmore? It's not like you're using him now."

Seeing no reaction, she started counting: "One, two, three—"

"Silence means consent."

"Alexander, you're such a good man."

She adjusted his blanket and stood, missing the faint twitch of his finger.

As Mrs. Valdemar, Dr. Whitmore received her promptly.

The world-renowned neuroscientist had created numerous medical miracles.

Only Patriarch Valdemar could have secured his services.

Hearing Alexander's prognosis tightened Sophia's chest.

Even for a stranger, the slim chance of a vegetative patient awakening was suffocating.

"Dr. Whitmore, could you treat another patient?"

He said Patriarch Valdemar's approval was needed.

After thanking him, Sophia headed straight for the Patriarch's room.
###Chapter 12

After Alexander Valdemar fell into a coma, Patriarch Valdemar became the stabilizing force of Valdemar Holdings.

He shuttled daily between the sanatorium and the corporate office, juggling concerns for his grandson's condition with managing the undercurrents within the empire.

When Sophia Laurent knocked lightly on the hospital door, the patriarch was reviewing documents.

"Enter."

He looked up, surprise flickering in his eyes at her presence.

"Grandfather."

Sophia took a steadying breath before using the unfamiliar address.

The patriarch set down his fountain pen, his gaze piercing. "What brings you here?"

Though his tone remained even, the authority radiating from him made most people avert their eyes.

Sophia met his stare with clear, unwavering resolve.

"I need a favor. Margaret Delaney, who raised me, has been comatose since her fall two years ago. Could Dr. George Whitmore examine her?"

The patriarch studied her in silence.

"I'll handle transportation personally. The medical expenses are my responsibility."

Her voice carried neither subservience nor arrogance.

After a measured pause, he nodded. "Granted. But our personnel will supervise throughout."

"Really?"

Sophia hadn't expected the notoriously decisive patriarch to agree so readily.

Genuine gratitude shone in her eyes. "Thank you, Grandfather!"

"Dismissed." He waved a hand.

As Sophia exited, the steward ventured, "With the hospital on high alert, why would you—"

"If she's asking, this person matters deeply to her."

The patriarch's expression hardened.

"Controlled vulnerabilities make for better leverage."

Understanding dawned on the steward.

Pre-marriage investigations had shown Sophia Laurent warranted closer scrutiny than Emily Lowell.

This woman was far more than she appeared.

Beyond metaphysical considerations, the Valdemars currently needed a "Mrs. Valdemar" to steady the ship.

"Your assessment?" the patriarch suddenly inquired.

The steward considered. "Exceptional poise, elite education. Only her family background—"

The patriarch gave a slight nod and retrieved his pen.

When Sophia approached the sanatorium director, the man received her with deference.

After a confirming phone call, an ambulance stood ready within minutes.
###Chapter 13

Margaret's medical report arrived swiftly.

Dr. George Whitmore adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses before handing the treatment plan to Sophia Laurent.

"Miss Laurent, the patient has been comatose for too long. We can only attempt multiple therapies, but the outcome remains uncertain."

Sophia accepted the documents, her fingertips trembling slightly.

After two years of hospital visits, she had grown accustomed to doctors' helpless expressions.

"I understand. Thank you."

A weight lifted from Sophia's shoulders once Margaret was settled at Valdemar Sanatorium.

Night fell.

She decided to visit Alexander Valdemar and express her gratitude.

Without the Valdemar family's influence, Dr. Whitmore wouldn't have taken the case so readily.

The process had gone smoother than expected.

At the hospital room entrance, a bodyguard stared at her with hesitation.

"Something wrong?" Sophia arched an eyebrow.

The guard flushed crimson. "N-no."

He silently opened the door.

As Alexander's personal security, he'd never witnessed anyone daring to poke the young master's face.

Could this count as workplace harassment?

But they were legally married...

Sophia squirmed under his peculiar gaze.

Silence enveloped the room.

Moonlight streamed through the curtains, casting fractured patterns across Alexander's pallid features.

"Thank you."

Sophia rested her head beside the bed, her voice feather-soft.

"The Patriarch approved Dr. Whitmore's treatment for Margaret."

She studied the man's sculpted profile and suddenly smiled.

"If this therapeutic marriage actually works, you'd better wake up soon."

The heart monitor beeped rhythmically.

Exhaustion overtook Sophia as she drifted into sleep.

Deep in the night.

A finger twitched on the hospital bed.

Alexander Valdemar's eyelids fluttered open.

Through blurred vision, he glimpsed an unfamiliar sleeping face.

The woman curled beside him, her lashes casting elongated shadows in the moonlight.

He tried to speak, but no sound emerged.

Overwhelming fatigue pulled him back into darkness.

Morning sunlight stung Sophia's eyes.

She jolted awake.
###Chapter 14

Sunlight streamed through the window when Sophia Laurent opened her eyes.

She realized with a start that she'd slept slumped over the hospital bed all night.

A dull ache radiated from her stiff neck as she slowly straightened up.

A sharp pain suddenly stabbed through her abdomen.

She froze.

The recent chaos had almost made her forget she was pregnant.

Sophia instinctively glanced at Alexander Valdemar lying motionless on the bed.

The man remained unconscious, his breathing steady.

She exhaled in relief.

The doctor and nurse entered for routine checks.

Alexander's external injuries had improved, but his consciousness showed no signs of returning.

Sophia quietly stepped aside.

Her hand resting on her stomach, she turned and left the room.

The office restroom mirror reflected her pale face.

After freshening up, she headed straight back to the hospital.

"Ms. Laurent, your test results show some abnormalities."

The female doctor adjusted her glasses, expression grave.

Sophia's grip tightened on her purse strap. "What's wrong?"

"We recommend running more detailed tests."

Two hours later.

The doctor spread a thick stack of reports across the desk.

"Do you plan to keep this pregnancy?"

Sophia shook her head. "No."

The doctor hesitated, fingers trembling slightly as she flipped through pages.

"Your uterus has congenital abnormalities. Getting pregnant was already medically improbable."

"This conception is nothing short of a miracle."

"If you proceed with termination..."

The doctor took a deep breath. "Not only might you become permanently infertile, the procedure itself carries extreme risks."

Sophia's nails dug into her palms.

The antiseptic smell in the examination room suddenly turned suffocating.
###Chapter 15

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly as she clutched the medical report.

"What are the chances of success?" Her voice shook.

The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Less than thirty percent. I advise you to consider carefully."

Her legs felt like lead as she walked out of the examination room.

Her phone buzzed with an unfamiliar number.

"Hello?"

"Madam, this is the housekeeper at Westmount Villa. Your family is here - your parents and older brother."

Sophia froze.

Westmount Villa was Alexander's wedding gift. She hadn't even visited yet. How did the Lowells get the address?

"What do they want?"

"They said they came to see you. Shall I send them away?"

She bit her lip. "No. I'm on my way."

An hour later, the black sedan entered the gated community.

The luxury villas sat nestled among manicured gardens, each with private courtyards. Sophia's residence occupied the prime lot, valued at over a billion.

"Welcome home, Madam." The butler opened her car door.

Inside, Richard Lowell sipped tea from fine china while Victoria and William surveyed the leather furnishings.

"Sophia!" Richard rose with a broad smile.

She remained in the doorway. "What do you want?"

Victoria's face darkened. "Is that any way to speak to your parents?"

"Parents?" Sophia gave a humorless laugh. "Shall I remind you how you abandoned me in the countryside, Victoria?"

William slammed his hand on the table. "Sophia!"

"Was I wrong?" She met their gazes squarely. "When I had a 104-degree fever at eight, my adoptive parents made me scrub floors on my knees. At fifteen, I thought I was dying during my first period. Where were you?"

Victoria paled. "The Cunninghams would never—"

"Of course. You'd always trust your precious adopted daughter over me." Sophia clenched her fists. "Here for money?"

Richard waved his hands. "We just wanted to see how you're doing."

"Seen enough?" She pointed to the door. "Goodbye."

Victoria rushed forward and grabbed her arm. "How dare you treat us this way! We gave you life—"

"Giving life means nothing without raising it." Sophia shook her off. "Butler, show them out."

The medical report burned in her bag. These were her flesh and blood - always causing more pain when she needed help most.
###Chapter 16

Victoria Lowell trembled with rage, her fingers gripping the sofa armrest. "You ungrateful wretch!"

"Exactly. I'm ungrateful. What can you do about it?" Sophia Laurent curled her lips in a cold smile.

Victoria paled, collapsing onto the couch.

"What sin did I commit to deserve a daughter like you? You don't even understand basic filial duty!"

Sophia scoffed. "Some people don't deserve to be parents."

The whole neighborhood had witnessed her suffering in Emily's household.

The truth was there for anyone who cared to ask.

Yet they chose to believe that hypocritical couple over their own flesh and blood.

"You—" Victoria gasped for breath.

Richard Lowell stepped forward to mediate. "Sophia, don't speak to your mother like that. She just expresses herself poorly. What parent doesn't love their child?"

"We're no longer related." Sophia's voice remained calm.

"Blood ties can't be severed that easily." Richard maintained his gentle smile.

Sophia studied him for several seconds before suddenly laughing. "Just say it. Why did you come today?"

Richard exhaled in relief. "I'm glad you're being reasonable."

A flicker of mockery crossed Sophia's eyes.

"I heard you froze your mother's bank card?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Yes. Is there a problem?"

She wouldn't just freeze the account—she'd reclaim every cent Victoria had spent without authorization.

Those unauthorized expenses were legally recoverable.

Richard frowned. "Now that you're successful, supporting your parents is only right."

"Is that all?" Sophia's tone dripped with disdain.

"There's more." Richard's expression darkened. "I heard you joined Pearl Group to target Lowell Entertainment?"

Sophia burst out laughing. "William told you that?"

She glanced at William Lowell standing nearby.

"First, my bank account is my business."

She'd spend her money however she pleased—no emotional blackmail would work.

"Second, where I work is my choice."

"Third, Lin Yuan Group's project is open bidding. May the best company win."

Their faces twisted at her words.

William was the first to explode in furious curses.
###Chapter 17

"Sophia Laurent, have you lost your mind?" William Lowell slammed the table and stood abruptly. "Helping outsiders steal our family business? And you dare smile?"

Veins bulged at his temples as his finger jabbed violently at the desk.

"Is this your revenge for the arranged marriage?"

Sophia lounged in the leather sofa, twirling a lock of hair around her finger.

"I'm happy. What's it to you?"

Her lilting voice carried a teasing hook.

William's face darkened. "I'll have Pearl Group fire you tomorrow."

"Pfft—"

Sophia doubled over with laughter.

"Call them now," she wiped tears of mirth from her eyes. "Shall I dial for you?"

Richard Lowell blew steam off his tea with deliberate slowness.

Victoria Lowell adjusted her shawl without looking up.

No one intervened.

They all waited to see their rebellious daughter fall.

William intentionally put the call on speakerphone.

"What an honor." Oliver Granger's voice crackled with static. "To what do I owe this call from the great William Lowell?"

Sophia snorted.

The Pearl CEO never followed conventional scripts.

"I want you to fire Sophia Laurent," William demanded bluntly.

Silence.

"Excuse me?" Oliver's tone turned peculiar.

"Name your price," William glared at Sophia. "Get her out of Pearl."

"HAHAHAHA—"

Booming laughter vibrated through the phone.

"Mr. Lowell," Oliver gasped between guffaws, "I suggest you visit a neurologist."

William froze.

Never in his life had he been publicly humiliated.

"Oliver Granger!" He ground his teeth. "Lowell Entertainment can crush Pearl like an ant!"

"Be my guest," came the lazy reply. "Do try harder."

The line went dead.

Crystal chandelier light fractured in Sophia's eyes.

She applauded softly.

"Bravo."
###Chapter 18

William Lowell's temples throbbed with rage at Oliver Granger's flippant tone.

He was about to explode when the call disconnected with a sharp beep.

His face darkened as he raised his phone, ready to smash it.

"Breaking it will cost you," Sophia remarked coolly.

William froze mid-motion, his expression comically stiff.

Richard Lowell slammed his teacdown. "Sophia, enough."

He adopted a pained expression. "Family matters shouldn't be aired in public. You're making us a laughingstock—"

"Laughingstock?" Sophia's lips curled in derision. "Since when were you my family?"

She turned to the butler. "Call security."

The butler bowed immediately. "Yes, Mrs. Valdemar."

Armed guards arrived within moments.

Richard's face twisted. "Sophia!"

Victoria shrieked, "How dare you!"

The guards already had them by the arms, dragging them toward the exit.

Veins bulged on Richard's forehead.

William hurled obscenities.

Victoria thrashed wildly. "Ungrateful wretch!"

She'd bragged about this visit on social media—being ejected was humiliating.

"I've done nothing wrong," Sophia stated icily.

Victoria's face contorted. "We raised you!"

"Neglect isn't parenting." Sophia addressed the butler. "Ban them from the premises."

"Understood."

The trio was unceremoniously shoved through the gates.

Richard straightened his rumpled suit. "We'll leave on our own!"

Standing outside the mansion, their expressions grew increasingly venomous.

"William," Richard ground out. "Teach Pearl Entertainment a lesson."

William's eyes glinted dangerously. "I'll make them beg."

Victoria kept ranting. "She'd never have married into the Valdemars without us! That ingrate!"

Conveniently forgetting how they'd forced Sophia into the arranged marriage.

A phone rang abruptly.

Victoria answered impatiently.

Whatever the caller said drained all color from her face.

"What's wrong?" Richard frowned.
###Chapter 19

Victoria Lowell jolted awake at his voice.

She hastily shoved her phone into her purse, her gaze evasive. "Nothing important. Just an insurance salesman."

"Hmm." Richard Lowell frowned but was too preoccupied with casting decisions to press further.

"Let's go. Sophia's being stubborn now, but she'll come crawling back once she hits a wall with the Valdemars."

With the infighting at Valdemar Holdings, her position as the young madam wouldn't last.

When Pearl Entertainment inevitably collapsed, she'd return begging for forgiveness.

William Lowell stormed ahead, his face dark.

His fists clenched until his nails bit into his palms.

That ungrateful sister of his had humiliated him publicly.

Once he secured the Pearl Group deal, he'd make Sophia kneel before him.

Whatever sibling affection remained had curdled into pure hatred.

Victoria watched her husband and eldest son's retreating backs, her heart pounding.

That lawyer's call had doused her in ice water.

The embezzlement accusation—nine million—left her hands numb with dread.

They could never find out.

She needed to consult Emily first.

"Richard," she stopped abruptly, "I'd like to visit Emily."

He flipped through a script without looking up. "She's preparing for that variety show with Nathan. I'm heading to the office—we can go together."

She'd already heard about Emily joining "The Voice." "Alright."

William's voice was icy. "I'll go ahead."

He couldn't wait to convene an emergency meeting.

If Pearl Group wanted to play hardball, he'd show them real ruthlessness.

At Westmount Villa, Sophia inclined her head slightly to the steward.

"Thank you for today."

The steward, sharp-eyed as a hawk yet unusually gentle with her, bowed. "You honor us, madam. This is our duty."

She smiled faintly.

"Shall I give you a tour of the villa?"

It was her first official stay.

"Please."

They walked through spacious corridors.

"All areas are open to you except the study."

Sophia understood. "Of course."

Alexander's private domain wasn't somewhere she'd intrude.

As Sophia explored her new home, alarms blared through the sanatorium.

Dr. George Whitmore stared at Alexander's brain scans, urgently summoning his medical team.
###Chapter 20
Alexander's Medical Report

Dr. Whitmore studied the test results for three straight hours. He removed his glasses and rubbed his temples before dialing Patriarch Valdemar's number.

The Valdemar Holdings boardroom had just witnessed a heated debate. Shareholders were arguing fiercely over the new energy project.

"Patriarch, we need to discuss Alexander's condition in person," Dr. Whitmore's voice came through the receiver.

The patriarch hung up and scanned the room with a dark expression. These once-obedient shareholders now eyed him like predators.

Thirty minutes later, a black Maybach pulled up outside the sanatorium.

Dr. Whitmore handed over the EEG results. "Between 11 PM and 2 AM last night, Alexander exhibited significant brain activity fluctuations."

"What does this mean?" The patriarch's fingers trembled slightly.

"It suggests he may have briefly regained consciousness," Dr. Whitmore lowered his voice. "Though fleeting, this is a major breakthrough."

The patriarch turned to the butler. "Any unusual activity in the room last night?"

The butler checked his logbook. "Madame Laurent remained by his bedside all night. The nurse found her asleep beside his bed during rounds."

The patriarch narrowed his eyes. "Did Sophia and Alexander have prior connections?"

"They met at several business galas," the butler added. "As the Lowell Group's chief secretary, Madame Laurent would have frequently encountered Alexander at events."

The patriarch stroked his cane thoughtfully. "Increase surveillance on the room."

Dr. Whitmore continued, "Clinically, such brainwave patterns often precede awakening. But the exact timeline remains unpredictable."

"Keep this confidential," the patriarch ordered. "Public statements should still indicate poor prognosis."

"Understood." Dr. Whitmore nodded. "I'll handle the report discreetly."

The patriarch consulted specialists in detail. The orthopedic chief reported excellent fracture healing, while the neurologist emphasized continued observation.

At dusk, the patriarch stood alone by the hospital window. The setting sun cast his elongated shadow across Alexander's pale face.
###Chapter 21

The hospital room was so quiet you could hear the IV drip.

The Patriarch stood by the bed, gazing at Alexander for a long moment. Finally, he sighed deeply, quickly wiping the corner of his eye before turning to leave.

As he pushed open the door, his posture straightened. His face regained its imposing authority.

"Contact Sophia Laurent. Ask if she can come to the manor for dinner tonight."

The butler bowed in acknowledgment.

After discussing several company matters, the Patriarch strode away with steady steps.

At three in the afternoon, Henry Chamberlain arrived punctually at the hospital room.

Dark circles hung under his eyes. His suit jacket was wrinkled.

Since Alexander's accident, Henry had been working nonstop like a spinning top.

He had to deal with difficult shareholders while fending off the Valdemar relatives circling like vultures.

Worst of all, the confidential tasks Alexander had assigned before his coma now rested solely on Henry's shoulders.

His daily hospital visits became his only respite.

"The company operations remain stable. All departments are functioning normally."

"But the board members keep demanding to see you. The Patriarch is barely keeping them in check."

Henry loosened his tie and continued.

"Your father has been unusually quiet lately. I suspect he's plotting something."

"The media situation is temporarily under control, but secrets don't stay buried forever..."

His voice gradually trailed off.

As Alexander's college friend and most trusted confidant, Henry understood the danger better than anyone.

After thirty minutes of business updates, Henry rubbed his temples and pulled a file from his briefcase.

"We've made progress finding that person you asked about."

"There are over ninety thousand women named Tiffany Morrison nationwide. After screening, we're down to about a thousand potential matches."

Henry gave a tired smile.

"If only the hotel surveillance hadn't been tampered with. This wouldn't be so difficult..."

The figure in the bed remained motionless.

Henry studied Alexander's pale face, then abruptly changed topics.

"Oh, the Patriarch arranged a marriage for you."

"I wonder if we should keep searching for that Tiffany Morrison you..."

His words cut off abruptly as his eyes widened in shock.

Alexander's finger had just twitched.
###Chapter 22

The office fell into dead silence when Vincent's computer screen went black.

His frantic keystrokes did nothing to stop the surveillance files from disappearing one by one.

"We're screwed..." Vincent's face turned ashen. "Someone planted a remote virus."

I rushed to my workstation only to find design blueprints being overwritten at alarming speed.

The red progress bar slithered across the screen like a venomous snake, devouring months of work.

"Pull the ethernet cables!" Alexander barked.

Too late.

My trembling fingers clicked open the last remaining folder.

Empty.

"At least..." I forced calm into my voice. "The cloud backup..."

As we scrambled to recover data, Isabella strode in on stiletto heels.

Her gaze swept across the chaos before settling on us with barely concealed satisfaction.

"Mr. Valdemar," she announced. "The Patriarch demands your immediate presence at the manor. You're to bring Ms. Laurent and Vincent."

Alexander's fingers drummed a grim rhythm on the desk.

We all knew this breach had reached the highest levels of Valdemar Holdings.

Vincent shot me a panicked look. "Sophia—"

I avoided his eyes.

No doubt Diana was already waiting at the manor to enjoy this spectacle.

The Valdemar estate blazed with light.

Tension crackled in the air the moment we stepped into the parlor.

The Patriarch occupied the head position, flanked by watchful Valdemar relatives.

Sebastian lounged on a sofa, eyes gleaming with schadenfreude.

"Sit." The Patriarch's voice carried exhaustion.

A tablet on the coffee table displayed Mountain Group's latest press conference—they'd already begun pitching our stolen project.

"Explain." The teacup hit the table with a sharp crack.

I studied the Persian rug's intricate patterns.

This trap had been perfectly laid. Even uncovering the truth wouldn't help now.

"Ms. Laurent's studio," the Patriarch declared suddenly, "will vacate Valdemar Tower by tomorrow."

The words struck like a slap.

He needed a scapegoat.

"Understood." My own voice sounded eerily calm.

Aunt Victoria snorted. "Guilty conscience."

Vincent shot to his feet. "Uncle! The surveillance was my responsibility! Sophia had nothing—"

Aunt Eleanor yanked his sleeve hard.

"Vincent." My quiet warning stopped him.

Alexander remained statue-still throughout.

I understood his silence—this wasn't about data theft, but the undercurrents of Valdemar succession.

The Patriarch didn't want truth.

He wanted control.

Beyond the floor-to-ceiling windows, night swallowed the city whole.

Someone had made their move in this silent war.

And we were all just pawns on their chessboard.
###Chapter 23

Sophia Laurent had just settled into bed for an afternoon nap.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled patterns across the sheets.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the quiet.

She fumbled blindly to answer, her voice thick with sleep. "Hello..."

Ethan Winston's icy tone pierced through the line. "Sophia, finally decided to call me?"

His words carried barely restrained fury.

She jolted awake.

Glancing at the caller ID to confirm it wasn't a dream, she replied calmly. "Wrong number."

The hospital diagnosis had rattled her enough to dial his number by mistake.

Ethan chuckled darkly, his voice dripping with lazy amusement. "Just say you want to see me."

Leather creaked as he shifted in his chair, fingers tapping the desk. "Dinner at our usual spot tonight?"

Sophia: "?"

She drew a sharp breath, her voice turning arctic. "Go to hell!"

She only wanted to discuss the child.

Yet he assumed she was reaching out.

Ethan stared at the disconnected call, his expression stormy.

The dial tone mocked him when he tried calling back—straight to voicemail.

Ethan: "..."

A low laugh escaped him.

Was this her way of demanding he grovel?

Lowell Entertainment Headquarters.

Richard Lowell marched straight to his office to prepare for the new film.

Victoria Lowell sought out Emily instead.

Emily had been inseparable from Nathan Lowell lately while preparing for their music variety show.

Victoria knew her way around the building well.

She often dropped by with homemade treats for her children.

The recording studio door stood slightly ajar in silence.

Victoria pushed it open.

"Who's there?" Nathan snapped, looking up.

His expression shifted upon recognizing her. "Mom?"

Victoria paused in the doorway, an odd feeling creeping over her.

For a split second when she entered, they'd seemed... too close.

Emily bounded over, looping an arm through hers. "Mom! You came to see us?"

Her sugary voice dispelled Victoria's unease.

Siblings working closely together was perfectly normal.

Victoria smiled. "How's the preparation going?"

Emily beamed. "Nathan wrote a new song. It'll blow everyone away."

Victoria patted her daughter's hand. "Your brother is talented, but don't overwork yourselves."

Emily nodded obediently. "We won't."

Nathan stood apart, his gaze troubled.

Something felt missing from his new composition.

He just couldn't pinpoint what.
###Chapter 24

Nathan Lowell's fingers glided lightly across the piano keys. A beautiful melody echoed through the music room. He paused, frowning slightly.

Something felt missing in this newly composed piece.

As a top singer in the music industry, he held nearly perfectionist standards for his work. But now, he had to admit he'd hit a creative block.

He stood and walked to the window, his gaze falling on the Golden Melody Award displayed on the wall. His first major award for "Wilderness."

The creation process of "Wilderness" remained vivid in his memory.

That summer after returning from the Royal College of Music, he'd composed obsessively in the Lowell family music room. Yet no matter how many revisions he made, the piece lacked soul.

Until one morning, he discovered unfamiliar musical notations added to his manuscript.

Those subtle changes brought the entire composition to life instantly. Like adding color to a black-and-white photograph, every note gained vitality.

"Wilderness" became an instant hit.

Since then, whenever his creativity stalled, some mysterious hand would revise his scores. Without exception, those edited pieces became chart-topping hits.

Nathan always suspected Emily Lowell.

In the entire Lowell family, only the siblings understood music. And he knew better than anyone about Emily's musical genius.

He remembered testing her once: "Em, how would you improve this melody?"

Emily had only smiled gently. "Your composition is already perfect, brother."

The light in her eyes shone pure and warm, like winter sunlight.

When this music program invitation came, Nathan immediately thought of Emily. He wanted the world to see how brilliant his sister truly was.

"Nathan." Victoria Lowell's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Fetch some fruit for us. I'd like to speak with Emily alone."

Nathan nodded and left, closing the door behind him.

Only mother and daughter remained in the music room.

Victoria's smile faded, replaced by deep concern.

"Emily," she grasped her daughter's hands. "Mother is in trouble..."
###Chapter 25

Emily Lowell clung affectionately to her mother's arm. "Mom, you must be joking," she cooed. "Who would dare upset you?"

Victoria Lowell sighed heavily.

Her expression darkened as she recalled Sophia Laurent's icy glare. "It's your sister," she admitted. "I don't understand how she became so..."

A calculated gleam flashed through Emily's eyes, though her face remained the picture of filial devotion. "Mom, Sophia just has a stubborn personality," she soothed. "Deep down she's not bad. Please don't take it to heart."

Victoria visibly relaxed at her younger daughter's comforting words.

"Oh, if only your sister had half your understanding," she lamented. "I'd thank the heavens."

From birth, Sophia had been difficult - a constant source of frustration.

Emily, in contrast, might as well have been her biological child.

Graceful. Accomplished. Beautiful. Successful.

A shining star among elite socialites.

Finally unburdening herself, Victoria confessed, "Your sister hired a lawyer to sue me."

Emily feigned shock. "Sue you? Whatever for?"

"Two years ago she gave me a bank card," Victoria explained bitterly. "I've used it for some purchases since then. Now she demands repayment with interest."

"How outrageous!" Emily's delicate brows furrowed in apparent distress. "If Sophia has issues with me, she should take it up directly. Why target you and William?"

Her lips trembled slightly, eyes glistening with unshed tears. "I know she still resents me. She can treat me however she pleases, but to do this to you..."

Victoria's heart ached at the sight. She pulled Emily into a tight embrace. "This isn't your fault, darling. Your sister simply has a petty, vindictive nature."

Resting against her mother's shoulder, Emily allowed a triumphant smirk to flicker across her face before quickly schooling her features.

"Mom, don't worry," she declared with righteous fervor. "I won't let Sophia succeed."

Her voice rang with indignation. "Children honoring their parents is natural law. What Sophia's doing violates basic morality. If this gets out, society will condemn her. We can't just accept this humiliation."

Victoria straightened, emboldened by her daughter's words.

Exactly her thoughts.

What was wrong with a successful daughter supporting her mother?

For Sophia to threaten legal action over such trivial matters was sheer filial impiety!

"But..." Victoria hesitated. "Your sister seems determined this time. If word gets out among my social circle, how could I show my face? Is there another way?"

Emily pretended to consider. "There is one approach," she said slowly. "Though it might not reflect well on Sophia..."

Victoria perked up. "What is it?"

"You know I'll be filming that variety show with Nathan soon," Emily began carefully.

"These programs always have pre-and post-broadcast interviews - extremely high visibility."

Her voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "If we leak this story to netizens, the public pressure would force Sophia to back down. She'd never dare proceed with such an unfilial lawsuit..."
###Chapter 26

A calculating glint flashed in Emily Lowell's eyes as her crimson lips parted. "Even if Sophia acts so arrogantly, she wouldn't dare sue her own mother publicly. That would be the ultimate act of filial impiety..."

Her fingertips tapped rhythmically on the table with absolute confidence.

She knew exactly how to wield the blade of public opinion.

Victoria Lowell's eyes lit up, her wrinkles smoothing out. "You're right! Parents are entitled to their children's money. If this goes to court, the public backlash would drown her!"

The more she thought about it, the more pleased she became.

A family like the Valdemars valued reputation above all else.

Would Sophia dare risk it?

"My clever girl." Victoria affectionately grasped her adopted daughter's hand. "Come, let's have afternoon tea. We'll invite Nathan too."

Emily nodded obediently, but coldness flickered in her gaze.

This time, she would utterly destroy Sophia's reputation.

...

Westmount Villa.

After blocking Ethan Winston's number, Sophia fell into a deep sleep.

Sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains, casting dappled patterns across her delicate features.

She slept until sunset.

Stretching lazily, she reached for her phone.

Several unknown calls were swiftly deleted.

Then a notification popped up:

[Breaking! Nathan Lowell and Emily Lowell to appear together on "We Are Singers"!]

Sophia arched an eyebrow and clicked.

The top five trending topics were all related.

Comments flooded in:

"OMG the perfect siblings!"

"The Lowell genes are insane! So talented!"

"Can't wait to hear Emily sing!"

Sophia chuckled softly.

All these years of praise must have inflated their egos beyond measure.

As she was about to exit, a private message appeared:

[Inviting Sophia Laurent to serve as special guest judge on "We Are Singers"...]
###Chapter 27

"Voice of the Heart" is Blueberry TV's most ambitious music competition reality show this year.

The entry barrier is remarkably low. Contestants range from street performers to professional singers.

Anyone with a musical dream can take this stage.

The entire show is broadcast live, allowing audiences to witness contestants' transformations. Ultimately, a professional judging panel selects the most promising new star.

After two seasons, the ratings have skyrocketed.

Now the third season is in preparation.

Sophia Laurent's inbox received the show's invitation for the third time.

She had declined the previous two.

This time, curiosity struck her. She wanted to see for herself what this so-called musical prodigy, elevated to godlike status, was truly made of.

Now that she'd stepped down as CEO of Lowell Group, she had all the time in the world.

Her fingertip tapped the screen. "Schedule cleared. Send the contract."

As she was about to exit, an instant reply popped up.

"Oh my god! Composer T finally said yes!"

"Contract will be in your inbox immediately!"

"When would you like to sign? We're at your disposal!"

Sophia watched the frantic messages with an amused smirk. "Tomorrow morning. Send the address."

"Perfect! Shall we arrange a car for you?"

"Unnecessary."

"Understood! Please review the contract first. We'll send the location shortly!"

She closed her phone and headed to the bathroom.

Post-nap radiance glowed on her skin. She smoothed a few stray strands in the mirror.

Descending the stairs, she contemplated finding a new residence. Staying at the company long-term was hardly appropriate.

"Madam." The butler waited respectfully at the foot of the stairs.

Sophia nodded. "Yes?"

"Patriarch Valdemar requests your presence for dinner at the sanatorium."

Her lashes flickered slightly.

An unexpected summons from the Valdemar family patriarch?

She maintained her composure. "Very well."

The butler gestured toward the door. "The car is ready."

Picking up her handbag, a thoughtful glint passed through her eyes.

This carefully arranged dinner—she was curious what performance awaited her.
###Chapter 28

The Valdemar Sanatorium nestled halfway up the mountainside, surrounded by lush greenery in tranquil seclusion.

Patriarch Valdemar hung up the phone with Westmount Villa's housekeeper and immediately instructed the kitchen to prepare dinner.

By the time Sophia Laurent arrived, the dining table was already laden with exquisite dishes.

"Grandfather." She gave a slight bow. "You wanted to see me?"

"Come sit." The patriarch gestured to the seat opposite him. "Just a simple meal and conversation."

"Of course."

As Sophia took her seat, the housekeeper promptly provided cutlery and a warm towel.

The aroma of food filled the air, stirring her appetite.

Patriarch Valdemar sipped his ginseng chicken soup while discreetly observing the young woman across from him.

Sophia focused on savoring the delicacies before her, contentment evident in her eyes.

Watching her enjoy the meal inexplicably eased the old man's recent troubles.

"Are you settling in well at the Valdemar residence?"

Sophia swallowed a bite of shrimp, her lips curving slightly. "Very well."

She set down her chopsticks and retrieved a check from her bag.

"This is for Margaret's medical treatment. Though it hardly covers Dr. Whitmore's fees..."

The patriarch glanced at the eight-figure sum with mild surprise.

"Family shouldn't stand on ceremony."

Sophia's fingers brushed the edge of the check.

She knew the Valdemars had paid far more to secure the royal physician's services.

"Put it away." His tone brooked no argument.

After a brief hesitation, Sophia returned the check to her bag.

"Thank you, Grandfather."

A comfortable silence settled over the table.

The patriarch studied the composed young woman with growing admiration.

At Red Leaf Temple, he'd dismissed the healing marriage superstition as absurd.

But with Alexander's condition deteriorating and no specialist able to help, he'd grasped at this final straw.

Though he'd personally arranged the Valdemar-Lowell alliance years ago, he'd never intended to force it upon the younger generation.

Until the accident.

He'd given the Lowells a choice.

Break the engagement with compensation.

Or honor it with any conditions they named.

They'd chosen the latter.

Setting down his spoon, Patriarch Valdemar finally spoke.
###Chapter 29

"Sophia, have you met Alexander before?"

Sophia Laurent paused with her chopsticks mid-air.

She nodded slightly. "Only from a distance at a few galas."

Patriarch Valdemar studied her expression closely. "What do you think of him?"

Sophia set down her utensils.

Her gaze met the old man's probing eyes.

"Mr. Valdemar is renowned as one of the most accomplished young elites in the capital." She chose her words carefully. "They say his admirers could form a line stretching across the entire city."

Her answer was impeccably diplomatic.

Yet the patriarch frowned.

"Do you feel wronged marrying him now?"

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly.

She sensed the hidden meaning behind his sudden concern.

Just days ago, he'd barely acknowledged her presence.

"Not at all." Her voice remained steady.

Even comatose, Alexander Valdemar remained the fantasy of countless socialites.

The real injustice came from her own family's schemes.

From her ex-boyfriend's betrayal.

None of which had anything to do with Alexander.

The patriarch observed her for a long moment before smiling. "Let's eat."

He'd initially viewed this marriage as a mere transaction.

But since Sophia's arrival, Alexander had shown signs of waking.

This forced him to reconsider the young woman before him.

"Visit Alexander after dinner."

Sophia agreed immediately.

She'd planned to go regardless.

Margaret's treatment still depended on the Valdemar medical team.

The atmosphere gradually warmed during the meal.

To his surprise, the patriarch found Sophia's perspectives aligned remarkably with his own.

His impression of her improved considerably.

After dinner, Sophia first checked on Margaret.

The attending physician was adjusting her treatment plan.

Hearing Dr. Whitmore's methods showed promise deepened her gratitude toward Alexander.

Approaching the hospital room, her pulse quickened.

The security guard scrutinized her for several seconds before opening the door.

His stare made her skin crawl.

Stepping inside, she shook off the discomfort.

The man on the bed lay motionless as ever.

She tiptoed to his side.

"Sleeping beauty, I'm here to see you..."

Her words died as she met a pair of obsidian-dark eyes.

Alexander Valdemar, newly awakened, stared back at her in silence.
###Chapter 30

Sophia Laurent pulled up a chair and sat beside Alexander Valdemar's bed.

She rested her chin in her palm, studying the sleeping man with undisguised curiosity.

Alexander's sharp features looked softer in repose. His thick lashes cast delicate shadows that softened his usual intimidating aura.

"With looks like these, he could've been a top-tier celebrity..."

Alexander had woken the moment Sophia entered.

This arranged marriage filled him with resentment.

A childhood betrothal? A therapeutic marriage? Absurd.

He'd already promised the title of Mrs. Valdemar to someone else.

But his injuries kept him immobilized for now. There would be time to end this farce later.

He hadn't expected this woman to be so bold.

First giving him nicknames, now staring at him so brazenly.

He could feel the heat of her gaze burning into him.

Was she planning something inappropriate?

Sophia suddenly felt the room temperature drop.

Though Alexander hadn't moved, the atmosphere grew strangely oppressive.

"A sleeping prince is much more approachable than an awake devil..."

She recalled how society women had only dared steal glances at him from afar during the last gala.

When conscious, Alexander's presence was too overwhelming for casual proximity.

After a while, Sophia remembered Patriarch Valdemar's demeanor at dinner.

The old man truly seemed to consider her his granddaughter-in-law.

This was problematic.

"Alexander, you need to wake up soon."

Once he regained consciousness, she could reasonably request a divorce.

The Valdemars had saved Margaret. She couldn't be the one to initiate separation.

But if Alexander demanded it, no one could object.

Sophia stood to leave.

The chauffeur waited in the hallway.

"Shall we return to Westmount Villa now, Mrs. Valdemar?"

Westmount Villa?

Where exactly was home?
###Chapter 31

The rustling trees swayed as summer night winds brushed past Sophia Laurent's cheeks, carrying the hum of cicadas.

She gave a slight nod. "Alright."

Westmount Villa felt like a thermal spring to her. Though it couldn't fill the void of her childhood, it had cracked open the ice encasing her heart.

Since returning to the Lowell family, she'd been like a lone wolf in foreign territory.

They'd forced her into Emily Lowell's school. The faculty and students there were already drenched in Emily's tears, making Sophia the target of collective hostility.

In everyone's eyes, she was the vicious true heiress who'd stolen the nest, daily tormenting the kind-hearted impostor.

University finally freed her from Emily's shadow, but left her unable to form close bonds.

Apart from the Lowells, Ethan Winston had once been her most familiar presence.

She'd imagined spending her life with him.

Now it seemed nothing but a fool's dream.

Back at the villa, the invitation for "We Are Singers" arrived as promised.

The meeting was set at an exclusive garden restaurant in the suburbs, its membership-only policy making it a discreet gathering spot for industry insiders.

The next day, Sophia appeared at the restaurant entrance in a blue shirt-dress and white sneakers.

She didn't announce her reservation, walking straight inside.

"Sophia?"

That familiar voice made her pause.

Turning, she met Ethan's handsome features and Isabella Evans clinging to his arm.

Sophia's gaze cooled as she looked away.

"Sophia Laurent!" Ethan's voice turned icy.

Isabella's smile faltered briefly before recovering. "What a coincidence. Shall we dine together?"

Her chin lifted, eyes glinting with concealed disdain.

She'd seen this ploy countless times.

Wasn't this how Sophia had climbed into Ethan's bed?

Too bad the man belonged to her now.

"Pass." Sophia's lips curled slightly. "I don't share tables with trash."

Isabella's face twisted. "Have you lost your mind?"

Sophia strode toward the private room without looking back.

Ethan watched her retreating figure, memorizing the room's name.

As he motioned to his assistant, Isabella remarked pointedly: "Isn't that Lucas Sheridan? The director of 'We Are Singers'?"

Her insinuation hung in the air. "Even interns fight tooth and nail to get into that show."
###Chapter 32

The Winston Group indeed owned an entertainment company.

Though modest in scale, it had earned considerable prestige within the industry.

As the heir, Ethan Winston rarely involved himself in its day-to-day operations.

Yet he understood the industry's unspoken rules all too well.

Sophia wanted to enter the entertainment world?

When had she become so ruthlessly ambitious?

Meeting a director in secret?

At an exclusive members-only club, no less?

What exactly were they discussing?

His frown deepened with each thought.

He knew how striking Sophia's beauty was. Talent agencies would be lining up to sign her.

But had she considered the perils awaiting an unconnected newcomer in that cutthroat arena?

Isabella Evans observed Ethan's darkening expression, her lips curling imperceptibly.

If Sophia was willing to degrade herself for fame, she wasn't even worth the effort of eliminating.

Such opponents didn't deserve her attention.

"Ethan, we should go in. Your parents have been waiting..."

He snapped back to reality with a terse nod.

Arm in arm, they proceeded toward the private dining room.

But Ethan's steps were noticeably heavier than before.

Meanwhile, Sophia stood before the reserved suite, rapping lightly on the door.

Inside, Director Lucas Sheridan paused his discussion with an assistant.

The aide hurried to answer.

At 38, the acclaimed director of "We Are Singers" was renowned for his discerning eye.

When he saw the young woman at the threshold, his words died in his throat.

She wore a simple white tee and jeans, her hair in a high ponytail.

Porcelain skin.

And those eyes—luminous pools reflecting starlight.

"Young lady, are you... lost?"

A knowing smile touched her lips. "Director Sheridan, I'm exactly who you're expecting."

Her research had been thorough. She recognized him instantly.

His eyes widened. "You're... Composer T?"

"Just a pseudonym."

She extended her hand gracefully. "Sophia Laurent."

Lucas was rendered speechless.

Five years ago, a mysterious composer known only as "T" had emerged.

Initially overlooked, every artist who performed T's compositions skyrocketed to fame.

Especially Adrian Valentine, whose career was launched overnight by a single T-penned hit.

Soon, "T" became the industry's golden standard.

From legends to rising stars, everyone coveted T's songs.

The uncanny part? Every composition became a chart-topping phenomenon.

Thus, the industry bestowed the reverent title: Composer T.

Yet T's identity remained an enigma.

Some speculated a retired music maestro. Others imagined an elderly virtuoso.

Never in Lucas' wildest dreams had he imagined Composer T would be a woman in her early twenties.
###Chapter 33

Director Lucas Sheridan's coffee cup clattered to the floor.

Dark stains splashed across his polished leather shoes. He didn't even notice.

"You...you're Composer T?"

His voice trembled slightly from shock.

Sophia Laurent stood at the conference room doorway. Sunlight streamed in behind her, casting a golden halo around her silhouette.

"The one and only."

She casually waved her phone. The screen displayed the famous musician's account.

The director's assistant scrambled to clean up the broken porcelain.

"Please, have a seat!"

Lucas practically tripped over himself to pull out a chair for her.

His eyes sparkled like he'd discovered a new continent.

Who would have thought the musical genius shaking the industry was this stunning young woman?

Sophia sat gracefully. Her black trench coat draped elegantly over the chairback.

"Did you bring the contract?"

She cut straight to business.

Lucas hastily retrieved a stack of documents from his briefcase.

"This is the invitation for 'We Are Singers.' Third episode judge..."

His fingers tapped nervously on the papers.

Sophia took the contract and skimmed through the terms.

The conference room fell silent except for the rustling of pages.

"Pen."

She extended her hand.

Lucas blinked. "You're signing now?"

"Is there a problem?"

She arched an eyebrow.

The director scrambled to produce a fountain pen.

As the pen scratched across paper, Lucas's excitement grew.

"Miss Laurent, have you considered entering the entertainment industry?"

He ventured cautiously. "With your talents..."

"Not interested."

Sophia snapped the contract shut.

She slid the documents back and straightened her collar.

"Music is just a hobby."

The words froze Lucas's expression mid-smile.

The conference door burst open.

"Director, the next segment—"

The staff member's voice died abruptly.

All eyes locked onto Sophia.

Lucas jolted to his feet.

"Let me walk you out."

From conference room to elevator, the director chattered nonstop.

"We'll arrange a private dressing room..."

"Any special requests for promotion..."

Sophia pressed the elevator button with a slight nod.

"Standard procedure is fine."

The closing doors cut off Lucas's eager gaze.

Dim lights flickered in the underground parking garage.

Her heels clicked sharply against concrete.

Keys jingled in her hand when a cold laugh echoed behind her.

"Moving up in the world?"

The voice made her fingers freeze mid-air.
###Chapter 34

Sophia turned to find Ethan's brooding expression staring back at her.

Her brow furrowed slightly. "Since when did you develop a habit of eavesdropping, Mr. Winston?"

His dark eyes gleamed dangerously. "Meeting with Lucas Sheridan—are you trying to break into the entertainment industry?"

"None of your business." Her voice was glacial.

She reached for the car door handle.

A powerful grip suddenly clamped around her wrist.

"We need to talk."

Ethan refused to release his hold.

The moment their skin made contact, Sophia recoiled as if burned.

"Let go!"

His grip loosened in shock at her violent reaction.

"Was that really necessary?" His brows knitted together.

"I'll call the police if you don't release me." Her words dripped with ice.

Ethan reluctantly dropped her wrist, disbelief written across his face.

"Sophia, how much longer will you keep this up?"

The bustling parking lot forced him to exercise restraint.

Rubbing her reddened wrist, Sophia's eyes turned arctic.

"You think this is me throwing a tantrum?"

A bitter laugh escaped her.

So in their eyes, her resolve was merely childish rebellion.

Ethan froze.

Those once-tender eyes now regarded him with complete detachment.

For three years, her gaze had always shone with warmth when looking at him.

Now it held the indifference of a stranger.

An inexplicable tightness gripped his chest.

"After three years together, you should know how I feel."

Sophia's nose stung.

Three years of memories couldn't be erased so easily.

"What exactly do you want to say?"

"We can go back to how things were." Ethan's voice softened.

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

"The arranged marriage with Isabella was a family obligation," he murmured.

"And?"

"In private, nothing changes. I'll treat you well."

Sophia's pupils contracted violently.

He wanted her to be his secret mistress?

A chill crawled up her spine.

The familiar face before her suddenly became unrecognizable.
###Chapter 35

Sophia Laurent stared at the face that once haunted her dreams. Now it felt terrifyingly unfamiliar.

Without hesitation, she raised her hand. The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the empty parking lot.

"Ethan Winston, your audacity knows no bounds."

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Did you really think I'd wait for you forever?"

Ethan's cheek burned. He stood frozen, unable to believe Sophia had struck him.

"Three years together, and you just walk away?" His voice tightened. "I can give you everything except marriage."

He tried reasoning with her. "With me, you'll never have to beg for opportunities. Winston Group's resources are yours for the taking."

Only then did Sophia understand his confidence.

He thought she'd come to meet the director for a role.

"Save it." Her gaze turned icy. "We're over."

Ethan frowned.

"That night was a mistake, but throwing wine in my face..."

No woman had ever treated him this way.

And Sophia had ignored him for days.

She cut him off sharply. "Ethan, are you deaf?"

Suddenly remembering, she raised her right hand.

The diamond ring on her finger glittered under the lights.

"Forgot to mention. I'm married now. Let's pretend we're strangers."

This ring was part of the set Patriarch Valdemar had given her.

She'd forgotten to remove it after trying it on.

Ethan looked thunderstruck. "Married? Impossible!"

Everyone knew Sophia belonged to him.

"Sophia, don't joke about this..."

Seeing his shock gave her a twisted satisfaction.

"Dead serious." She yanked open the car door. "My husband dislikes me mingling with exes."

The red sports car roared to life and sped away.

Ethan stood motionless until his phone rang.

How could Sophia be married?

He took a deep breath and answered.

"Isabella, I'm coming home now."
###Chapter 36

The moment the trailer for Episode 3 of "We Are Singers" dropped, Twitter exploded.

The show's official account was flooded with over a hundred thousand comments in seconds.

"Holy shit! Composer T is finally showing his face?"
"What kind of connections does this production team have to get someone as elusive as Composer T?"
"Pinch me, girls. Am I dreaming?"

Lucas Sheridan, the show's director, grinned ear to ear as he monitored the skyrocketing viewership numbers. The servers nearly crashed from the overwhelming traffic.

His phone buzzed nonstop with calls from industry peers.

"Lucas, what did you offer Composer T to get him on board?"
"Director Sheridan, can you save a spot for our artist next season?"

Lucas remained silent, amused. Who would've thought a single phone call was all it took to secure the music industry's most enigmatic figure?

Inside a recording studio, Adrian Valentine ripped off his headphones.

"Contact the 'We Are Singers' team. Now."

His manager blinked in confusion. "But you always said reality shows were beneath you."

Adrian's fingers trembled slightly. "Composer T is judging this season."

The manager's coffee cup slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor.

Three years ago, Composer T's hit "Starlight" had catapulted Adrian from a bar singer to a superstar. He'd sent dozens of private messages since—all left on read.

"Is it too late to sign up?" Adrian grabbed his phone. "I'll call Director Sheridan myself."

His manager intercepted him. "Are you insane? Your album launch is next week!"

"Postpone it." Adrian's tone left no room for argument. "Nothing matters more than meeting Composer T."

Meanwhile, in a luxury penthouse...

Sophia Laurent muted her frenetically buzzing phone. On the coffee table lay the judge's contract from the show, signed with a single elegant "T."

She swirled her wineglass, watching amber liquid catch the light. Beyond the windows, neon lights pulsed—an entire city holding its breath for the musical spectacle to come.
###Chapter 37

Adrian Valentine shoved his phone screen right in front of his agent's face. His fingertips trembled with excitement.

"Look! Composer T is going to be a judge!"

The agent took the phone and raised an eyebrow.

"Voice of Asia? Composer T actually agreed to a variety show?"

Everyone in the industry knew this mysterious musician always turned down all invitations.

Adrian spun around in excitement.

"Who cares why he agreed! I'm signing up!"

The agent shook his head helplessly.

"If your fans saw you like this, your aloof heartthrob image would be ruined."

Adrian shrugged nonchalantly.

"No need for personas when meeting your idol."

The agent sighed and picked up the landline.

"Fine, I'll contact the production team. But—"

He paused suddenly, his expression turning serious.

"Nathan Lowell is also competing."

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smile.

"Perfect. Let him witness real talent."

Their rivalry had begun during last year's Golden Melody Awards.

Nathan's fans still trash-talked Adrian online.

The agent hesitated.

"Are you sure you want to share the stage with him?"

Adrian's eyes burned with determination.

"I'd walk through fire just to meet Composer T."

Meanwhile.

Nathan Lowell stared at his phone screen, his knuckles turning white.

"Composer T agreed to this trashy show?"

He'd sent three song requests that all went unanswered.

Emily Lowell peeked out from her livestream.

"Brother, what's wrong?"

The live comments exploded instantly.

Emily's so gorgeous! Sibling goals!

A wealthy heiress working this hard? We stan!

Nathan forced a smile.

"Nothing. Keep streaming."

He pocketed his phone, shadows flickering in his eyes.

This time, he'd make Composer T recognize who the real musical genius was.
###Chapter 38

Emily Lowell wore an off-white lace dress today. Her wavy long hair cascaded over her shoulders. She sat by the floor-to-ceiling window of the recording studio. Sunlight streamed through the glass, illuminating her delicate profile.

Her live stream viewers had surpassed one million.

"Who says I don't have troubles?" She gave the camera a faint smile. Her fingers absentmindedly played with the lace trim of her dress.

The live comments exploded instantly.

"What troubles could a goddess possibly have?"

"Maybe she's troubled about which Hermès bag to carry today?"

Emily's eyes darkened slightly at these teasing remarks.

"Actually..." She bit her lower lip. "My mother hasn't been in good spirits lately."

Fans immediately grew concerned.

"Who dared upset Mrs. Lowell?"

"Tell us Emily! We'll stand up for you!"

Emily shook her head, her eyes glistening. "It's family matters... concerning my sister."

The live stream fell silent for several seconds.

"Sister? Aren't you the only daughter of the Lowell family?"

Emily sighed softly. "I have a long-lost sister who was only found last year. But she..."

Her hesitant tone piqued the fans' curiosity.

"Did she bully you?"

"I know all about rich family drama! She must be jealous of Emily!"

Emily quickly waved her hands. "No, it's not like that. My sister just..." Her voice caught mid-sentence.

The comments flooded with sympathetic messages.

"Don't cry Emily!"

"What did that sister do?"

Emily wiped the corner of her eye, forcing a smile. "It's nothing serious really. My sister just refuses to come home often. Mother waits forever just to see her..."

She lowered her head, fiddling with her dress hem. Her voice grew quieter. "Last week was Mother's birthday. My sister didn't even call..."

The live chat erupted.

"That's too much!"

"Raised outside the family - no manners at all!"

Emily hurried to explain. "No, my sister probably just..."

"You're too kind-hearted Emily!"

"Who needs such an ungrateful sister!"

Emily waved her hands anxiously. "Please don't say that. My sister actually..."

Before she could finish, a flood of new viewers entered the stream.

The comment tone shifted abruptly.

"Heard this stream is discussing the eldest Lowell daughter?"

"I know that sister - she's amazing!"

Emily's expression faltered briefly before she regained her composure. "Seems we have some friends who know my sister here."

She flashed the camera a sweet smile. "That's all for today. See you next time~"

The broadcast ended abruptly.

Fans exchanged bewildered looks.

What... just happened?
###Chapter 39

"Let's get one thing straight first—this is just casual conversation." Emily Lowell raised a finger to the camera, her eyes pleading. "Please don't disturb my sister."

The live comments exploded instantly.
Don't worry Emily, we promise not to bother her.
We just feel bad for you and want to know what happened.

Emily sighed softly, her eyes turning red.
"My sister sued our mother to reclaim the money spent over the past two years..."

She bit her lower lip, voice trembling.
"The money isn't the issue. But her actions humiliated Mom in social circles. These days Mom can't even eat properly. It breaks my heart..."

The stream went wild.
OMG! Suing her own mother?
What kind of monster does that?
Even a dog would show more gratitude!
Girls, I found her social media—let's go teach her a lesson!

Emily lowered her head to hide a smirk, then looked up with feigned panic.
"Stop! You promised me!"

She stomped her foot anxiously, tears welling up.
"I shouldn't have said anything..."

The door suddenly swung open.
Nathan Lowell entered carrying a fruit platter, frowning at his sister's distress.

"Emily, what's wrong?"

She clung to his sleeve like a lifeline.
"Fourth Brother, I messed up..."

Nathan ruffled her hair affectionately.
"Big brother's here. Nothing can hurt you."

The comments section erupted.
Aww Nathan's so protective!
Why can't I have a brother like this?

Emily sniffled pitifully, pointing at her phone.
"I shouldn't have said anything..."

Nathan took the phone, scanning the rapid-fire comments.
"What happened?"

Fans rushed to explain.
Not Emily's fault!
That ungrateful witch deserves to be exposed!

Nathan's expression darkened as he scrolled.
"Someone explain properly."

One comment stood out:
Your biological sister sued Mrs. Lowell!
###Chapter 40

Nathan Lowell's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone.

"What the hell is Sophia Laurent up to now?"

Emily Lowell bit her lower lip, her eyes slightly reddened.

"Brother...Mom told me not to say anything...It's my fault for losing control during the live stream..."

"How is this your fault?"

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously.

"Explain. Now."

Emily twisted her fingers nervously, her voice trembling.

"Sophia filed a lawsuit against Mom...The legal notice arrived today."

Nathan shot up from his seat.

"Is she insane? On what grounds?"

He couldn't comprehend how Sophia dared to sue their own mother.

Emily's gaze flickered toward the live stream camera as she spoke softly.

"Remember when Mom forgot her card while shopping...She happened to run into Sophia..."

"Sophia lent her a card...Now she's accusing Mom of unauthorized use."

Emily knew exactly how much Victoria had spent.

Sophia's meager salary couldn't even cover one of Emily's designer bags.

Was this petty sum worth a courtroom battle?

What an embarrassing spectacle.

Just wait until the Valdemars hear about this...

A triumphant glint flashed in Emily's eyes.

Blood relation meant nothing.

Sophia would always remain in her shadow.

Bang!

Nathan slammed his fist on the table.

"Is she out of her mind?"

His entire body shook with rage.

"She's caused nothing but trouble since returning! Now she dares to sue Mom?"

The live stream comments exploded.

What an ungrateful daughter!

Shouldn't children support their parents?

This is clearly intentional humiliation!

How could the Lowells raise such disgrace?

We found her! Her name's Sophia Laurent!

Netizens worked quickly.

Sophia's social media accounts were thoroughly exposed.

So she's the long-lost Lowell daughter...
###Chapter 41

Sophia Laurent was taken back to the Lowell family at thirteen. They raised her for ten whole years. Now that she's grown wings, she dares to bite the hand that fed her?

Emily Lowell's fan group exploded with outrage.

"We found out! Sophia Laurent is the chief secretary at Lowell Entertainment!"

"Pathetic. Getting a job at her own family's company? That's pure nepotism."

"If the Lowells hadn't taken her in, she'd still be picking through trash in the slums!"

On the live stream, Emily and Nathan Lowell were sharing intimate moments. Their subtle expressions of distress instantly ignited the fans' fury.

The angry mob stormed Sophia's social media accounts.

"Sophia! Have you no conscience?"

"Buying things for your mother is basic decency. How dare you sue her?"

"Ungrateful wretch! They should've smothered you at birth!"

Sophia was currently handling transition work at Pearl Group, completely unaware of the online storm.

When the target remained silent, the enraged fans escalated their attacks. They turned their fury toward Lowell Entertainment's official account.

"Fire Sophia! She doesn't deserve to work there!"

"Nepotistic trash. How is she qualified to be chief secretary?"

"Partners will cancel contracts if they know you employ such people!"

The flood of hate comments nearly crashed the company's social media page.

Soon, Lowell Entertainment issued an official statement:

"Sophia Laurent has left Lowell Entertainment and is currently employed by Pearl Group. Please refrain from further commentary."

This announcement only fueled the fans' frenzy.

"See! Even her own family doesn't want her anymore!"

"She must have done something shady!"

"Let's take this to Pearl Group's page!"

The digital mob immediately redirected their attack.

Pearl Group CEO's Office.

Oliver Granger watched the hate-filled screen with a cold smirk.

His fingers flew across the keyboard as he personally typed the response:

"Sophia Laurent is Pearl Group's employee. We're keeping her. Don't like it? Call the police."

The unexpected clapback left everyone speechless.

"Is Pearl Group insane?"

"Birds of a feather flock together!"

"Did their PR team get hacked?"

Neutral observers found the exchange highly entertaining.

"First time seeing a company with actual backbone!"

"That reply was savage!"

"Gen Z really out here revolutionizing corporate culture!"
###Chapter 42

Pearl Group's official statement ignited the fury of online trolls like a spark.

The comment section quickly escalated from passive-aggressive remarks to vicious curses.

Half of the top ten trending topics were dominated by this scandal.

The situation spiraled out of control like an avalanche.

Oliver Granger stared at the malicious photoshopped images on his screen, his knuckles turning white.

Pearl Group's official account issued another statement: "Zero tolerance for cyberbullying. Our legal department has gathered evidence and will prosecute all individuals involved in personal attacks."

This strong stance sobered up many bystanders.

But Emily Lowell and Nathan Lowell's die-hard fans only intensified their attacks.

Sophia Laurent headed straight to Pearl Tower after signing the "We Are Singers" contract.

As she entered the office area, she heard the sound of documents being slammed in the CEO's office.

She pushed the door open to find Oliver Granger glaring at his computer screen.

"Planning to smash your keyboard, Oliver?"

His tense expression softened slightly when he saw Sophia. "Perfect timing."

With a cold smirk, he pulled up the trending page. "Look what your dear sister has done. The entire internet is vilifying you."

Sophia skimmed the sensational headlines indifferently:

#Disowned Heiress Sophia Laurent Sues Biological Mother
#Lowell Family's True Daughter Proves Ungrateful
#Pearl Group Shields Controversial Celebrity

The pinned video showed Emily Lowell tearfully saying in a livestream: "It's all my fault for speaking carelessly... My sister is actually very kind..."

Oliver slammed the desk. "Who does this green tea bitch think she's fooling?"

Sophia scoffed. "Just a ridiculous clown performing."

"They're trying to pressure you into dropping the lawsuit with public opinion," Oliver realized. "The Lowells want to renege?"

"More than that." Sophia toyed with her phone. "They aim to destroy my comeback."

Oliver's eyes turned icy. "In their dreams."

"Don't worry." Sophia stood up. "I'll make them reap what they sow."

Oliver exhaled in relief. "I'm glad you're okay."

What terrified him most was how those vile words might wound her.
###Chapter 43

Oliver Granger relaxed slightly when he saw Sophia Laurent's composed expression.

"Those spreading malicious rumors must face consequences."

"I'll leave it to you then, Mr. Granger."

Sophia walked out of the CEO's office, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

She unlocked her phone to find social media notifications flooding in.

With a tap, she posted an update.

Sophia Laurent: Unauthorized expenditures will be reclaimed.

The comment section erupted instantly.

"How dare you begrudge your own mother money? Ungrateful wretch!"

"After all she's done for you, you quibble over petty cash?"

"Legal fees will cost more than the amount in question. Pathetic."

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips as she typed her response.

Sophia Laurent: From age 13 to 18 - five years totaling $170,000. Including Emily Lowell's hand-me-downs.

The internet divided into opposing camps.

"$34,000 annually is nothing for a wealthy family!"

"Emily's single dress costs over $100,000. These numbers don't add up."

"Post your university expenses if you're so bold."

Cold fury flashed in Sophia's eyes.

Sophia Laurent: Not one cent from the Lowells after turning 18.

The comments section went briefly silent before exploding with renewed vitriol.

"Who paid your tuition then? Liar!"

"@LowellFamily expose this fraud!"

Sophia played her trump card.

Sophia Laurent: @LowellFamily Care to dispute this?

The attached itemized bills sent shockwaves across social media.

"She even accounted for meal expenses? Brutal."

"Masterstroke. Waiting for the Lowells' response."

"How much did Mrs. Lowell actually spend on her?"

The meticulously documented figures landed like a stinging slap across the Lowell family's collective face.
###Chapter 44

The Lowell family was a prominent dynasty in the entertainment industry.

Richard Lowell held an esteemed position among film directors. In his youth, he was relatively unknown, having directed a few modest art films. Five years ago, his groundbreaking work Lone Mountain took the world by storm. Its raw depiction of the struggles of the underprivileged resonated deeply with audiences, catapulting him to A-list director status.

William Lowell, the eldest son, managed the family empire. Frequently seen at high-profile business events, his sharp-suited executive persona earned him a massive following on social media.

Daniel Lowell, the second son, was a darling of the fashion world. A gold medalist at international design competitions, he now served as creative director of Versini Couture. This haute couture brand—the only one from the country to achieve global acclaim—sparked frenzied demand with every seasonal collection.

Christopher Lowell, the third son, was a sought-after actor. He made his debut in his father’s film and later became a heartthrob through a string of hit romantic dramas, captivating millions of young women.

Nathan Lowell, the fourth son, was hailed as a musical prodigy. His debut album dominated charts, and his concert tickets sold out within seconds.

Then there was Emily Lowell, the family’s beloved daughter and a constant media fixture. Her lavish lifestyle—million-dollar jewelry, limited-edition gowns, globetrotting adventures—epitomized elite privilege. Fans endlessly gushed about how the entire Lowell clan doted on her.

Now, Sophia Laurent’s recent financial disclosure had sent shockwaves through the public.

"Emily’s bracelet alone costs over a million, but Sophia only spent $170,000 in five years? The disparity is insane."

"Don’t forget that $170,000 included tuition and living expenses. Emily’s custom piano is worth eight figures, isn’t it?"

"The real question is how Sophia survived after high school without family support."

Skepticism erupted from all sides.

Some defended the Lowells: "At least they didn’t let her starve. $170,000 isn’t nothing."

"Suing her own mother? How heartless."

"There must be a reason for such unequal treatment between biological children."

Public opinion split sharply.

Then Sophia dropped another bombshell: "Mrs. Lowell misappropriated $9.37 million without my consent. I’m only demanding $9 million in return."

The comment section fell silent.

The staggering figure left everyone speechless.
###Chapter 45

The internet exploded in an instant.

Nine hundred thirty-seven thousand! The staggering figure detonated across comment sections.

"Holy shit! Mrs. Lowell actually spent that much of Sophia's money?"

"I'd have called the cops ages ago. That's not a mother—that's a bloodsucker!"

"Sophia has every right to sue. No mother should exploit her daughter like this."

Keyboard warriors switched sides overnight.

Emily's fans immediately jumped to her defense.

"Nine hundred grand for a secretary? Give me a break!"

"That money obviously came from the Lowells. Now she's biting the hand that fed her."

"Nine hundred thousand? At my salary, it'd take 150 years to save that much!"

Emily's smirk froze as she stared at her phone screen.

Victoria's hands trembled violently.

She never expected Sophia to expose their financial dealings so publicly.

"How dare she!" Victoria snatched a maid's phone.

Her shrill voice pierced the air when the call connected. "Sophia! Are you trying to drive me to my grave?"

Sophia flipped through documents, chuckling. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Don't play dumb! What's the meaning of those online posts?" Victoria's chest heaved. "You want the whole world to condemn your own mother?"

A fountain pen twirled between slender fingers.

"First, I wasn't the one who leaked it."

"Second," Sophia's gaze turned glacial, "where were you when the internet crucified me?"

Dead silence filled the line.

Victoria's nails dug crescent moons into her palms.

"Were they wrong?" she suddenly shrieked. "What's so terrible about a mother using her daughter's money?"

Remembering the earlier public sympathy, she straightened her spine.

"Withdraw the lawsuit. Issue a public apology. You can still be the Lowell heiress."

Sophia watched dusk paint the sky outside.

Her reflection in the window glass wore a sardonic smile.
###Chapter 46

Sophia Laurent's lips curled into a mocking smile as she listened to the deliberately magnanimous tone on the phone.

"Mrs. Lowell, haven't you realized it yet?"

She enunciated each word clearly.

"The title of Lowell heiress means nothing to me."

"Before returning to the Lowell family, I struggled to survive in a damp basement."

"After returning, I still lived in shadows—only this time, it was a gilded cage."

"I could see the light, but never reach it."

When she was first brought back to the Lowell mansion, she naively believed she'd finally found a home.

She thought she would have loving parents like other children.

But reality slapped her hard across the face.

These so-called family members not only withheld warmth, but treated her as a bargaining chip.

She gave them her heart, only to receive endless demands in return.

At least now, she had finally awakened.

"Mrs. Lowell, if given the choice, I wish I'd never been born into this family."

The shattering sound of a teacup hitting the floor came through the phone.

Victoria Lowell's hand trembled slightly as she staggered backward.

Had Sophia really lived like this all these years?

Fragments of neglected memories suddenly surfaced in her mind.

Meanwhile, Emily Lowell stared intently at her phone screen.

Since leaking the story online, she had been monitoring public reactions.

She knew Sophia hadn't spent much of the Lowell family's money.

What right did an adopted daughter have to their fortune?

But when she saw the transfer records showing Sophia had sent Victoria over nine million, her pupils constricted violently.

Impossible!

Where did Sophia get that kind of money?

"Emily, what's wrong?" Nathan Lowell approached.

Emily wordlessly handed him the phone. "Fourth brother, look at what sister posted..."

Nathan's brows furrowed instantly after glancing at the screen.

"Seventeen thousand? Is she joking?"

He remembered casually spending over two hundred thousand on a gaming computer.

Not to mention his expensive music equipment.

How could Sophia have only spent that little?

His annual allowance during college exceeded that amount.

"How shameless, fabricating such lies." Nathan sneered.

Emily pressed her lips together silently.

When Nathan saw the nine-million transfer record, his expression darkened further.

"Where did she get that money? Did the old man give it to her privately?"

Nine million wasn't petty cash—no way Sophia could have earned that herself.
###Chapter 47

Emily's eyes flickered with sudden realization.

"So that money came from Grandfather..."

Nathan's expression darkened. "She casually spent nine million on Mom without blinking. Clearly Grandfather's been generous with her. And now she dares bite the hand that feeds her? We never should have brought her back."

Emily bit her lip. "What do we do now? If Mom really used that money without Sophia's knowledge, the lawsuit could..."

"Stop panicking."

Nathan sneered. "Grandfather's money belongs to the Lowell family. What right does Sophia Laurent have to demand it back?"

A ruthless glint flashed in his eyes. "Even if this reaches Grandfather, she's the one at fault. Humiliating the Lowell family like this? Grandfather will make her pay first."

He immediately pulled out his phone and posted on Weibo.

Nathan Lowell: @SophiaLaurent Suing your own mother with Grandfather's money? Disgracing the Lowell name? Is this your idea of filial piety?

The post exploded across the internet instantly.

As a top-tier music idol, Nathan's fanbase dwarfed Emily's. Previously uninvolved fans swarmed to join the drama.

Netizens finally grasped the key point.

Wait—where did Sophia get that money? If it's from Patriarch Lowell, doesn't that make it family funds?

LMAO, using Lowell money to sue Lowells? What kind of mental gymnastics is this?

170k in damages? Is this a joke?

Still fuming, Nathan dialed Sophia's number.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

His face twisted. "She blocked me?"

Enraged, he hurled his phone against the wall. "Let's see how long she lasts without the Lowell name! She better not come crawling back!"

Emily's lips curled imperceptibly before she soothed, "Don't be angry, Nathan. You know how stubborn she is—"

"Unbelievable!" Nathan roared. "Where did she learn these gutter manners?"

Snatching his assistant's spare phone, he redialed.

This time, the call connected.

"Who is this?"

Hearing Sophia's cool voice, Nathan blurted, "How dare you block me?"

A soft chuckle came through. "That's why you called?"

Nathan flushed at his outburst. Controlling his temper, he hissed, "Listen carefully, Sophia. Grandfather's money is family money. What's done is done. Are you trying to make us a laughingstock?"

He took a sharp breath. "And that public lie? Have you considered the consequences?"

Sophia toyed with a pen, amusement coloring her tone. "Who said the money came from Grandfather?"

"What lie?"

Nathan frowned. "Not from Grandfather? Then where—"

His voice turned odd. "Don't tell me Ethan Winston gave it to you?"
###Chapter 48

Sophia Laurent curled her lips into a cold smile at Nathan Lowell's accusatory tone.

"Since when do I need to justify my finances to you?"

Nathan's face turned ashen with rage.

He clenched his phone, voice trembling with suppressed fury. "You're still a Lowell! Any scandal you cause reflects on the entire family!"

Sophia scoffed.

"Don't worry. I'll be issuing a formal statement to sever all ties with the Lowells."

The call ended with a decisive click.

Nathan hurled his phone onto the couch in frustration.

Emily Lowell approached with feigned concern. "Fourth Brother, about Sophia..."

She hesitated dramatically. "I heard Mr. Winston recently broke up with her. Do you think..."

Her words ignited Nathan's temper like a match to gasoline.

"She must have done something disgraceful!" he spat through gritted teeth. "How else would she get that kind of money?"

Emily lowered her head to hide her smirk.

With a practiced sigh, she murmured, "Don't upset yourself, Fourth Brother. The nine million is what matters now..."

"Over my dead body!" Nathan slammed his fist on the table. "Grandfather's money belongs to the family!"

Meanwhile, online outrage reached a boiling point.

Keyboard warriors swarmed Sophia's social media with vitriol.

Some called her ungrateful.

Others wished her dead.

Sophia scrolled through the hateful comments with detached calm before typing a single response:

Sophia Laurent: I have formally disowned the Lowell family. All funds are legally obtained.

The declaration set the internet ablaze.

Netizens erupted in disbelief.

"The Lowell Group is worth billions! She'd actually walk away?"

"A secretary with that kind of money? Who's she kidding?"

Sophia deactivated her account without another word.

Turning to her computer, she began analyzing past episodes of "We Are Singers."

Three days later...

On the premiere night of "We Are Singers," Nathan and Emily Lowell became the hottest trending topic.
###Chapter 49

Sophia Laurent, the long-lost biological daughter of the Lowell family, had been trending frequently lately. Her outrageous behavior sparked heated discussions across social media, bringing unprecedented attention to the Lowell siblings.

Nearly every other live comment mentioned Sophia's name.

"Nathan and Emily are absolutely stunning! No surprise they're siblings!"

"What does Sophia Laurent even look like? There's only a blurry side profile online. Is she too ugly to show her face?"

"Every Lowell is exceptional. How did they end up with a black sheep like Sophia?"

"Is she still pursuing that lawsuit against Mrs. Lowell? With all this backlash, she must have dropped it by now."

"Honestly, since it's the Lowell family's money, she shouldn't have sued in the first place..."

Lucas Sheridan frowned at the barrage of comments scrolling across his screen.

This Sophia Laurent... was she the legendary Composer T?

Composer T turned out to be a Lowell?

A derisive smirk curled his lips.

From what he knew, Composer T's single commission rate had reached five million three years ago. What was nine hundred thousand to someone like that?

Things just got more interesting.

On the show's set, the host enthusiastically introduced the five judges.

The first four were veteran music producers from previous seasons, receiving lukewarm responses.

"Ms. Xu Hong is back! I love her songs!"

"Gezale's grassland-style music is so unique..."

"Where's Composer T? When do they appear? I can't wait!"

"I only came for Composer T. Don't care about the other judges..."

As the anticipation peaked, the host suddenly raised her voice.

"Now, let's welcome our final judge—Ms. Sophia Laurent!"

The female host added, "You may not recognize the name Sophia Laurent, but her other identity is legendary—the music industry's acknowledged genius composer, Composer T!"

Thunderous applause erupted.

Every eye in the studio locked onto center stage.

The live stream comments froze momentarily.

The entire audience held their breath, awaiting the mysterious figure's appearance.

As music swelled, a slender figure stepped forward.

Under the spotlight, the young woman shimmered in a flowing lake-blue gown, her porcelain skin glowing, waist cinched delicately. Chestnut hair cascaded over her shoulders, dark phoenix eyes striking—a vision of breathtaking beauty.

The studio fell into stunned silence.

Several seconds passed before comments exploded.

"This... this is Composer T?"

"She's gorgeous! And so young?"

"Are we sure the producers didn't make a mistake? With looks like this, she could debut as an idol!"

At center stage, the young woman gracefully lifted her microphone.

"Hello everyone, I'm Sophia Laurent."

A pause, then her lips curved slightly.

"Also known as the composer you call T."

The room erupted in gasps.

"Did I hear that right? She's really Composer T?"

"She looks barely twenty! Composer T is this young?"

"If Composer T became famous five years ago, that means she started composing as a teenager?"

"My self-esteem just shattered. I'm clearly just taking up space in this world..."

"Wait—what did she say her name was? So...phia Laurent?"
###Chapter 50

The live comments exploded instantly.

Countless netizens rubbed their eyes frantically, afraid they'd misread the name.

"Sophia Laurent" shone brightly on the singer information panel, glaringly conspicuous.

The very same Sophia the entire internet had been vilifying these past few days was now standing on the "We Are Singers" stage?

The comment section erupted.

"It must be someone with the same name!"

"There's no way Composer T could be that vile woman!"

"I'd rather believe it's a typo by the production team!"

The host's earpiece transmitted Lucas Sheridan's voice.

His lips twitched almost imperceptibly.

In the backstage control room, Lucas stared at the barrage of malicious comments with a cold smirk.

These people had no idea who they were insulting.

The stage lights blazed to life.

Sophia stood in the spotlight wearing a white dress, bowing slightly to the judges' panel.

"Good evening, judges. I'm Sophia Laurent."

Her clear voice resonated through the venue.

The host suddenly spoke up. "Miss Laurent, have you been online recently?"

The venue fell silent.

Every audience member held their breath.

The camera zoomed in as Sophia's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

"Yes."

"Then you must have seen the news about the Lowell family?"

The question detonated like a bomb.

Sophia's lips curved slightly, starlight shimmering in her eyes.

"Of course."

She stared directly into the camera, enunciating each word clearly.

"After all, I am that Sophia in the news."

After a deathly silence, the comments went utterly berserk.

"Holy shit! It's really her!"

"Composer T is the real Lowell heiress?!"

"So that nine million dollars..."

Backstage in the green room.

Nathan Lowell staggered back two steps, his face ashen.

"Impossible..."

He stared at the figure on screen as if seeing his sister for the first time.

Emily Lowell dug her nails deep into her palms.

Blood dripped between her fingers, staining the carpet with dark crimson blooms.
###Chapter 51

Emily Lowell's nails dug into her palms as she stared at Sophia Laurent under the spotlight.

She had schemed tirelessly to turn the Lowell family against Sophia.

Yet this radiant woman before her was the legendary Composer T.

Emily staggered, gripping Nathan Lowell's arm for support.

She took a deep breath, a flash of malice in her eyes.

So what if she was Composer T?

Just a discarded daughter abandoned by the Lowells.

The entire Lowell family stood behind Emily. What chance did Sophia have?

The live stream exploded with activity.

Comments flooded in like a tidal wave.

"Sophia, I'm sorry for blindly criticizing you."

"Forgive my ignorance, Composer T. I'm deleting all my hateful remarks."

"I apologize for my prejudice. I'll keep my eyes open from now on."

...

Lucas Sheridan smirked at the skyrocketing viewership.

Sophia was his golden goose.

Anyone who touched his cash cow would answer to him.

That's why he'd instructed the host to ask those questions.

After the apologies, the tone shifted dramatically.

"Composer T is stunning!"

"That face could launch a thousand ships!"

"Please debut! I'll be your number one fan!"

...

Sophia remained oblivious.

At the host's invitation, she took her seat on the judges' panel.

"We Are Singers" officially began.

The first contestant, a folk singer, dazzled the audience.

The judges shared their opinions.

Three votes secured passage.

The following performances were decent but unremarkable.

Just as the audience grew restless, the host revived the energy.

"Our next singer's identity is written on your light boards!"

The crowd erupted.

"Nathan Lowell!"

"Adrian Valentine!"

"Melanie Vance!"

...

The host smiled mysteriously.

"Correct! Please welcome the talented singer Nathan Lowell with his original song 'Spring Love Song'!"
###Chapter 52

The stage lights suddenly blazed to life.

Nathan Lowell's tall figure appeared under the spotlight, triggering screams from the live audience.

The live comments exploded instantly.

"Nathan's finally on stage!"

"I've waited so long for this moment!"

But dissenting voices soon emerged.

"Did some people forget about the apology?"

"Nathan owes Sophia a public apology!"

The comment section quickly divided into two camps.

Nathan's fans flooded the screen.

"He's always the best!"

"This new song will blow everyone away!"

The criticism was equally sharp.

"Hypocrites don't deserve this stage."

"Even cruel to his own sister. Speaks volumes about his character."

The show director wiped sweat from his brow.

The episode's popularity exceeded expectations, but public opinion was spiraling out of control.

Nathan stood at center stage.

He wore a black suit with a silver brooch at the collar.

The musical intro began softly.

A melancholic ballad.

Nathan's deep, magnetic voice filled the studio.

"When starlight falls..."

The opening line silenced the audience.

At the judges' table, Sophia Laurent arched an eyebrow.

Her fingers tapped lightly on the scoring sheet before her.

The melody remained steady.

No dramatic crescendos.

Like lukewarm water.

Comments started expressing disappointment.

"Something's missing..."

"Nowhere near his previous work."

"Proof he needs Composer T."

Nathan's gaze drifted toward the judges.

Sophia was writing notes.

She never once looked up.

The deliberate disregard tightened his throat.

He nearly missed a lyric.

The audience noticed his faltering.

"He seems off..."

"Stage fright maybe?"

The chorus arrived.

Should've been the emotional climax.

But Nathan's delivery stayed flat.

Like completing an obligation.

Not performing.

Judge Adrian Valentine turned to Sophia.

"Your thoughts?"

She set down her pen.

"Mediocre."

Her blunt assessment made nearby staff gasp.

This was her brother.

Such coldness?

The final note faded.

Polite applause followed.

Nothing like the initial excitement.

Nathan bowed stiffly.

His conflicted gaze lingered on the judges.

The host bounded onstage.

"Thank you, Nathan Lowell!"

"Judges, your comments please."

The camera focused on Sophia.

The room held its breath.

Everyone awaited the new judge's verdict.
###Chapter 53

Nathan's chest suddenly felt hollow.

The judges' commentary session began as scheduled.

"This song is like a warm spring sun, capturing the tender emotions of youth."

"The style differs slightly from Nathan's previous works, but remains pleasing to the ear."

"Technically flawless, though the emotional depth feels somewhat shallow."

"Compared to Nathan's earlier pieces, this one lacks that wow factor..."

After the first four judges finished their critiques, the venue fell silent as Sophia's turn arrived.

Nathan tightened his grip on the microphone, his palms damp with sweat.

The live stream chat froze momentarily as viewers held their breath in anticipation.

Sophia lifted her gaze, her expression calm as still water.

"The composition is simple, but the melodic line—" Her voice cut off abruptly.

After a brief pause, she stated flatly, "A conventional love song. Nothing remarkable."

That subtle hesitation sent shockwaves through the audience.

The chat exploded:
-What was Composer T about to say?
-Does she know how to improve it?
-Finally, someone tells the truth! This song is mediocre.

Nathan stared intently at Sophia's profile.

She said "melodic line"? How would she know how to revise his composition?

An absurd thought flashed through his mind.

Impossible. She always avoided him.

Yet a voice inside him screamed: Ask her!

"What about the melodic line?" Nathan's voice was tight.

Sophia didn't even glance his way. "Irrelevant."

Those words ignited Nathan's fury.

"Leaving sentences half-finished," he sneered. "Is this Composer T's professionalism?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Other judges turned to Sophia curiously. "Ms. Laurent, perhaps you could share your suggestions?"
###Chapter 54

The judges whispered among themselves before nodding in agreement.

"The melodic structure is complete, but lacks a defining touch."

"Young man, music requires mutual fulfillment. Such solid foundation deserves refinement."

Nathan Lowell stood center stage, his piercing gaze fixed on Sophia Laurent.

A faint smirk played on his lips.

Sophia met his stare and arched an eyebrow.

"Fine."

She requested paper and pen from the staff. Her fingers danced across the page as musical notes flowed effortlessly.

Nathan's pupils contracted.

The sister he remembered always cowered in corners—a far cry from this commanding presence before him.

He still couldn't reconcile that timid girl with the legendary Composer T.

But when Sophia flawlessly reproduced the entire melody, his breath hitched audibly.

The judges leaned forward in unison.

Live comments exploded across the stream.

"Is she improvising edits live?"

"No wonder Nathan couldn't commission Composer T's work. Family drama."

"Siblings holding grudges? Petty much..."

Sophia finished her revisions and handed the sheet to the staff.

Nathan's eyes remained glued to that paper.

His fingers trembled slightly when accepting the score.

This handwriting...

Those annotated revisions that once appeared mysteriously in the music room—those brilliant modifications that awed him—all came from these hands.

He'd always assumed they were Emily's work.

His throat constricted.

"Nathan?" A staff member prompted softly.

Nathan snapped back to reality, his grip tightening until his knuckles turned white.
###Chapter 55

The host quickly adjusted her expression, steering the conversation back on track. But the live stream chat had already exploded.

"Nathan's expression just now was so strange!"
"I screenshot it—his eyes were red!"
"What on earth happened?"

Nathan Lowell's fingers trembled slightly as he took the sheet music. He immersed himself in it instantly, scanning each note while silently singing along in his mind.

Three minutes later, his head snapped up. His gaze locked onto Sophia Laurent with complex emotions.

Everything became clear.

All those modified musical arrangements—they were her handiwork.

In the backstage monitoring room, Director Lucas Sheridan frowned at the screen. He immediately pressed the intercom. "Have the host get him to perform it live."

"Nathan, could you sing this revised version for us?" The host smiled sweetly, though her eyes held probing curiosity.

Nathan's Adam's apple bobbed. After a moment of silence, he nodded. "Alright."

The music began.

The once bland melody suddenly came alive. The high notes burned like wildfire, the low notes caressed like gentle rain. The entire song pulsed with soul, making hearts tremble.

As the final note faded, the venue fell into stunned silence.

The live chat erupted.

"This is the Nathan I know!"
"The previous version can't even compare!"
"Wait...why does this style feel so familiar?"

Nathan's gaze never left Sophia. He searched her face for any clues but found only calm composure.

That once-timid girl now stood under the spotlight, radiant enough to blind.

"Why?" His voice tightened.

Sophia tilted her head slightly. "Hmm?"

The microphone emitted faint static in his grip. Just as he opened his mouth to speak, a scream pierced through the venue—

"Someone fainted!"
###Chapter 56

Nathan Lowell's gaze sharpened as he followed the staff member's hurried movements.

That direction was exactly where he had been standing with Emily Lowell moments ago.

His heart lurched. He broke into a sprint.

Sophia Laurent watched his retreating figure thoughtfully.

The expression on Nathan's face had clearly indicated he wanted to ask her something important.

And now, of all times, someone fainted?

She narrowed her eyes toward the gathering crowd.

Who else would make Nathan react like this except Emily?

If they weren't in the middle of filming, she'd have followed to see the spectacle herself.

Just then, the host received instructions from the director.

"Dear audience, due to unforeseen circumstances, we'll pause the live stream for ten minutes. We apologize for the inconvenience."

The broadcast cut off abruptly.

Live comments exploded instantly.

What happened? Who fainted?

Nathan looked frantic—was it Emily?

Tch, what perfect timing...

Exactly! Nathan was clearly about to ask Sophia something important!

Hearing the announcement, Sophia's lips curved slightly.

She rose and walked toward the commotion.

From a distance, she overheard someone questioning Nathan.

"Mr. Lowell, does Ms. Lowell have any preexisting conditions? Hypoglycemia? Anemia?"

"No." Nathan shook his head. "She's always been healthy."

"Please give her space. She needs fresh air."

Emily's assistant wrung her hands anxiously. "The ambulance is on its way. Everyone, please return to your seats. Nathan can stay with her."

She bowed repeatedly. "We're so sorry for the disruption."

The crowd murmured understandingly and dispersed.

Sophia approached unhurriedly.

Her glance swept over Emily, sprawled on the bench.

Rosy cheeks. Even breathing.

This didn't resemble a medical emergency.

"What did you want to ask me earlier?" Sophia cut straight to the point.

Before Nathan could respond, the assistant gasped. "Ms. Lowell is waking up!"

All attention snapped toward Emily.

Nathan immediately knelt beside her, grasping her hand.

"Where does it hurt?" His voice was tight.

Emily offered a weak smile. "I'm fine, Nathan. Probably just skipped breakfast..."

She glanced around apologetically. "So sorry for troubling everyone..."
###Chapter 57

The ballroom glittered under dazzling chandeliers. A crowd hovered around Emily Lowell, fussing over her delicate condition. She reclined limply on the sofa, her face paper-white and pitiful.

"Don't blame yourself, Emily. This wasn't your fault."

"You're so fragile. You should rest more."

"Composer T nearly smashed the piano in his rage earlier..."

A faint smile curled Emily's lips as her gaze found Sophia Laurent across the room. "Sister..." Her voice trembled. "The livestream incident... I truly didn't mean to..."

Sophia leaned against the champagne table, idly tapping her glass. She caught the fleeting triumph in Emily's eyes and chuckled. "Thanks to you, I gained three hundred thousand followers."

Emily's nails dug into her palms. Her attempt to sabotage Sophia had backfired spectacularly.

"Sister..." Tears welled in her eyes. "Are you really suing Mother? After all she's done for us..."

"Done for me?" Sophia swirled her champagne. "By abusing me?"

Emily opened her mouth to protest when she noticed Nathan Lowell's conflicted expression. She seized his hand dramatically. "Fourth Brother, I feel so faint..."

Sophia observed the performance coldly before speaking. "Nathan, ask your question now."

Her glass met the metal table with a sharp clink.

"After tonight, we're strangers."

Nathan wrenched his hand from Emily's grasp. "Why did you revise my score?" His voice tightened. "Why keep it from me?"

The ballroom fell silent. Emily's face drained of color, her perfectly applied lipstick cracking under bitten lips.

Sophia met his gaze.

"I once considered you family." She turned away, her skirt flaring decisively. "Now you're not worth explaining."

Nathan froze as if struck by lightning. A memory surfaced—three years ago, a timid girl hiding in hallway shadows, calling him "Fourth Brother" with hopeful eyes he'd ignored.

"Composer T." A deep voice broke the silence. A broad-shouldered man approached with raised glass, amber liquid reflecting his chiseled features. "An honor to finally meet you."
###Chapter 58

Nathan Lowell's brow furrowed slightly.

That voice was all too familiar.

Lifting his gaze, he saw the face he detested most.

Adrian Valentine beamed at Sophia Laurent. "I'm Adrian Valentine. Remember me?"

Sophia gave a slight nod, her lips curving into a faint smile.

"I do."

She had composed music for him before and listened to his songs.

Nathan stared at Sophia's smile, his frown deepening.

An inexplicable bitterness welled up in his chest.

Didn't this woman know Adrian was his sworn enemy?

Adrian noticed the scorching glare and turned with a raised brow. "Well, if it isn't our prodigy singer. What's this? Bonding with your sister backstage?"

Nathan's expression turned icy. "None of your business."

"Actually, it is." Adrian smirked. "The Lowell siblings are hogging public space and delaying the show..."

His gaze flickered between them. "This program isn't your private playground. Other contestants are waiting."

Nathan's face darkened. "What are you implying?"

Emily Lowell bit her lip, eyes glistening. "I'm sorry... This is all my fault..."

Seeing her distress, Nathan's anger flared.

"Adrian, enough. If you have a problem, take it up with me. Leave my sister out of this."

"Tsk tsk tsk." Adrian chuckled. "The legendary sister complex in action."

He cast a meaningful glance at Emily's teary face. "Pity some people remain oblivious pawns..."

Turning to Sophia, his expression softened.

"Composer T, let's go. No need to watch this farce."

Sophia had wanted to leave anyway. "Alright."

As they turned, Nathan suddenly spoke. "Sophia."

She paused, looking back impassively. "Yes?"

"You know exactly how things stand between us."

Their feud was common knowledge in the industry.

Sophia found it laughable. "What does that have to do with me?"

She'd heard rumors about the rising stars' rivalry.

But why should she care?

Nathan clenched his fists at her indifference. "You're still my sister."

Sophia actually laughed.

After a beat, she murmured, "What a curse that would be."

Nathan's face turned stormy.

Beside him, Emily watched Sophia's cold demeanor, the corners of her lips lifting briefly before morphing back into concern.

"Sister, how could you say such things?"
###Chapter 59

Emily Lowell's eyes brimmed with unshed tears. She bit her lip as she looked at Sophia Laurent. "Nathan has always been so kind to us. Even if you despise me, you shouldn't have said those hurtful things to him... He truly cares about you..."

Nathan Lowell stood nearby, his brow furrowed.

He had to admit Emily was right—blood ties couldn't be severed so easily.

Sophia let out a derisive laugh, her gaze icy. "His kindness to you doesn't extend to me."

Her voice was laced with frost. "And don't flatter yourself. You're beneath my notice."

She'd long seen through Emily's petty schemes and experienced enough of the Lowell family's favoritism.

Now, she wouldn't give Emily another chance.

Nathan suddenly erupted in anger. "Sophia! What have I ever done to wrong you?"

Sophia met his gaze squarely, her eyes sharp.

"Do you genuinely believe you've treated me well?"

She enunciated each word deliberately. "When Emily falsely accused me of stealing her necklace, you forced me to kneel in apology. When she claimed I ruined her dress, you destroyed my art studio. When she had me beaten at school and I came home for help, you slapped me instead..."

Nathan's face gradually paled.

Memories he'd deliberately buried resurfaced with painful clarity.

"Shall I continue?" Sophia's smile was cold.

Even now, for the sake of family interests, they'd unhesitatingly tried to marry her off to a comatose man.

What kind of family was this?

When they'd learned Ethan Winston had abandoned her, their first reaction had been "you must not have been good enough."

Nathan avoided her gaze, his voice unsteady. "I... I didn't know..."

He and Emily had grown up together—naturally, he'd trusted her more.

But now, doubt crept in.

Emily suddenly burst into tears. "Sister, why are you slandering me like this..."

She sobbed dramatically. "If it's because of me, I'm willing to leave the Lowell family..."

Sophia gave her a cold glance. "The truth can't stay buried forever."

Turning back to Nathan, she said, "If you want facts, go investigate for yourself."

With that, she turned to leave.

Adrian Valentine quickly followed. "Composer T, don't waste your breath on them! They're not worth your distress!"

He grinned as he caught up. "I wrote a new song just for you. Want to hear it?"
###Chapter 60

Nathan Lowell stared at the retreating figures, his knuckles turning white.

Adrian Valentine's triumphant expression fueled his rage.

Why?

He was Sophia's blood brother.

Her words echoed in his ears.

Forcing apologies. Destroying her room. That slap...

The Lowell heir had always been domineering but believed himself justified.

Forgotten memories now flooded back.

If Sophia had truly been framed...

A chill ran down his spine.

"Fourth brother..." Emily Lowell tugged his sleeve with tearful eyes.

He whirled around.

This time, her tears didn't soften him.

"If you're innocent, why panic?"

Emily's expression froze.

She forced a weak smile. "I just worry about you..."

Nathan studied her.

"I want to believe you."

He paused. "But truth always surfaces."

Emily paled.

"One more thing." Nathan narrowed his eyes. "Why didn't you explain about the sheet music?"

His first suspicion had fallen on Emily.

Only they two in the family understood music.

He remembered asking her.

And her silent admission.

"What sheet music?" Emily widened her teary eyes. "You must be mistaken."

"I asked if you touched it."

"I only picked it up." She bit her lip. "The wind was strong that day..."

Nathan frowned.

Could it really be a misunderstanding?

"Fourth brother..." Tears streamed down Emily's face. "Are you abandoning me?"

His heart softened. "Don't be ridiculous."

Seeing the sister he'd doted on since childhood, he couldn't stay harsh.
###Chapter 61

Nathan Lowell's chest burned with fury.

His knuckles turned white as he glared at the man laughing with Sophia Laurent in the distance.

That was his sworn enemy.

Why did his own sister have to side with him?

"Emily, go rest," he turned to Emily Lowell. "I'll have my assistant take you home."

Emily's head snapped up, panic flashing in her eyes.

"Fourth Brother, the show's about to start—"

"We Are Singers" was the hottest variety show right now, with Composer T guaranteeing record ratings.

She'd fought hard for this opportunity.

"You fainted earlier," Nathan said firmly. "Your health comes first."

Emily's eyes reddened with frustration.

"I'm fine, just a little low blood sugar—"

"Enough." Nathan cut her off. "My assistant will take you to the hospital."

As he turned to leave, Emily grabbed his sleeve.

"Fourth Brother!"

Nathan frowned and pulled his arm free.

"The show's starting."

He strode toward the studio without looking back.

Emily stood rooted to the spot, nails digging into her palms.

Her venomous gaze locked onto Sophia across the room.

Why hadn't that bitch died abroad?

Those useless foster parents should've smothered her at birth.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

Emily's face paled when she saw the caller ID.

She hurried to a secluded corner.

"Are you insane?" she hissed. "Why are you calling now?"

A raspy chuckle came through the line.

"Breaking bridges after crossing the river, Miss Lowell?"

Emily clenched her jaw.

"You'll get your money. Don't contact me again."

"Two million," the man demanded. "Things are heating up. My boys need to disappear."

Emily trembled with rage.

"You—"

"No payment? Fine." His voice turned sinister. "I wonder how the Lowells would react to learning their daughter hired hitmen—"

"Shut up!" Emily snapped. "Send me the account number."

She ended the call, her expression darkening.

This was all Sophia's fault.

Everything would've been perfect if she'd never existed.
###Chapter 62

"Two million?" Emily Lowell's grip tightened around her phone, her knuckles turning white.

The man on the other end chuckled. "Does Miss Lowell find it too expensive?"

"This is blackmail," she hissed, glancing around cautiously.

"What choice do we have?" His tone was mocking. "The boys are short on cash lately. If we don't get paid, we might have to tell everyone how Miss Lowell hired thugs to kidnap her own sister—"

"Shut up!" Emily's face drained of color.

A lighter clicked through the receiver. He exhaled smoke. "Made up your mind?"

Emily bit her lip until it bled.

"Give me three days."

"Smart girl!" He laughed. "Always knew Miss Lowell was reasonable."

Her hands trembled after hanging up.

Taking deep breaths, she dialed another number.

"Chris..." Her voice instantly cracked with fake tears.

Christopher Lowell was on a filming break. "Em? What's wrong?"

"I..." She hesitated. "Can you lend me some money?"

"How much?"

"Two million." The words came out barely audible.

His brows furrowed. "Did Sophia do something again?"

"No..." Emily quickly denied. "It's personal."

"Stop covering for her." Chris scoffed. "That lunatic's been stirring trouble online. Should've known she'd target you."

When his assistant offered iced coffee, he waved it away impatiently.

"Send me your account details. I'll transfer it now."

A smirk flickered in Emily's eyes, though her voice quivered. "Thank you, Chris..."

"Don't mention it." He sighed. "Once I wrap this shoot, I'm dealing with Sophia."

The transfer notification chimed as Emily touched up her makeup.

Staring at her flawless reflection, she sent the payment.

"Money's sent. Keep your mouths shut."

The instant reply came: "Don't worry, Miss Lowell. We're professionals."

She slammed her phone screen dark.

Stage lights illuminated Sophia Laurent during her interview, radiant as always.

Emily's nails dug into her palms.

This bitch was why those gangsters had leverage over her.

Payback would come.
###Chapter 63

Nathan's attitude had shifted. Sophia could clearly sense the newfound distance between them.

The unconditional doting she once received now felt like a veil had been drawn over it.

All because she altered a musical score?

Were material possessions truly more precious than two decades of shared history?

The stage lights dimmed at the center.

Adrian cradled his guitar as the final note trembled in the air.

"Thank you, everyone."

When he bowed, his gaze locked onto Sophia in the judges' panel.

This folk ballad had consumed half a year of his life.

He'd traversed northwestern deserts and southern river towns, transforming a wanderer's solitude into melody.

His warm vocals concealed steel-like resilience.

Exclamations of admiration rippled through the judging panel.

"Remarkable talent! This song speaks to every traveler's soul."

"Did you compose both lyrics and music? Your progress is astounding."

"It moved me to tears. Such depth from someone so young."

Adrian offered polite smiles, but his eyes never left Sophia.

His peach-blossom gaze shimmered with flecks of light.

Sophia's crimson lips curved upward.

"Emotionally rich, rhythmically compelling. Your performance perfectly captured the song's essence."

Adrian's eyes instantly brightened.

"Really? Thank you, Composer T!"

He beamed like a child receiving candy.

Live comments flooded the stream.

[OMG! Adrian's ears turned red!]
[That's Composer T! His idol!]
[Their chemistry is off the charts!]
[Can't stop screenshotting this perfection]

In the penthouse of Valdemar Tower, Ethan gripped the edge of his desk, knuckles whitening.

Three years together, yet he'd never known the woman who shared his bed was a music legend.

Nor that she carried Lowell blood.

If only he'd discovered sooner...

He snatched his suit jacket with sudden violence.

The elevator mirrors reflected his stormy expression during the descent.
###Chapter 64

Under the spotlight, Nathan Lowell stared at Adrian Valentine's radiant smile, his knuckles turning white.

He glanced at Sophia Laurent's smiling profile, feeling a lump in his throat.

But he couldn't leave now.

He had to choose Sophia as his mentor.

The realization tightened his throat.

He never dreamed that Composer T, whom he idolized, would turn out to be Sophia.

The irony was unbearable. Those precious musical revisions he treasured weren't from Emily Lowell at all.

Memories flooded back.

When Sophia first returned to the Lowell family, he had considered making amends.

But then...

Witnessing her repeated targeting of Emily, he'd sided completely with his adoptive sister.

For years, he'd treated Sophia with cold indifference while defending Emily at every turn.

Until today.

Onstage, Sophia shone so brightly that he couldn't help reevaluating his biological sister.

If those accusations were true...

Nathan closed his eyes briefly.

He needed time to investigate.

But right now, he just wanted to be near Sophia.

The first round of "We Are Singers" officially began.

Thirty contestants took the stage one by one.

Adrian's performance brought the house down.

Nathan's singing was equally stunning.

Two hours later, the judges announced the results.

"Advancing contestants: Adrian Valentine, Nathan Lowell, Chen Xue..."

The winners cheered excitedly.

The eliminated left quietly.

The host smiled. "Next is the mentor pairing session."

The venue fell silent.

All contestants nervously watched the judges' panel.

Adrian raised his hand first.

"Professor Laurent, please choose me."

His peach-blossom eyes brimmed with anticipation.

Sophia smiled. "Agreed."

The live stream exploded.

[Our dream came true!]
[Divine pairing!]
[Their visuals are unmatched!]

Inside a black Maybach, Ethan Winston glared at the screen, his expression darkening.

"Drive faster," he ordered coldly.
###Chapter 65

As an industry titan, Winston Group's entertainment empire spanned the nation. For Ethan Winston, locating the filming site of "We Are Singers" took mere minutes.

On set, Nathan Lowell immediately interrupted when he heard Sophia Laurent accept Adrian Valentine's collaboration request.

"Sophia, you're partnering with me next round."

His commanding tone carried habitual authority, as though this were nonnegotiable.

Crew members exchanged glances. Several frowned.

Sophia's smile froze.

Her icy gaze swept over him. "No need. Our energies clash. Find someone else."

Live comments exploded.

[How rude!]
[Nathan asked her personally!]
[Who does she think she is? Just because she writes songs?]
[Emily's the better sister anyway.]

Tension crackled through the studio.

Nathan's knuckles whitened. "Explain yourself."

Sophia didn't even look at him. "Do I need to spell it out?"

She paused. "I don't want to work with you."

His face darkened.

"Forget the cameras," he snapped. "First Emily, then Mom, now me? When does this end?"

Sophia's laugh held no warmth. "If I had a choice, I'd renounce the Lowell name."

"The disownment notice is filed. I'm transferring my household registration soon."

His chest constricted.

"You're leaving the family registry?"

"Yes."

Her finality silenced him.

A sharp ache spread through his ribs—something vital slipping away.

"Is this necessary?" His voice dropped.

"Absolutely."

An uneasy hush fell.

The host hurried to mediate while judges smoothed things over. Mentor assignments eventually proceeded.

During the lunch break, Sophia exhaled—only to spot the last person she wanted to see.
###Chapter 66

The recording for "We Are Singers" took place in the private garden of a five-star hotel.

The production team had booked the entire venue. Only staff and invited guests were permitted entry.

Sophia Laurent had just finished rehearsals and was drinking water in the rest area.

When she looked up, she unexpectedly met a familiar pair of eyes.

Ethan Winston strode toward her in a crisp tailored suit.

"Sophia, we need to talk."

She set down her water bottle, her expression instantly turning frosty.

"Mr. Winston, we have nothing to discuss."

Their exchange drew curious glances from nearby crew members.

Noticing the attention, Ethan frowned slightly.

But he quickly softened his tone. "You won't even speak to me now?"

"No."

Her reply was crisp and final.

She couldn't forget how he'd called them mere acquaintances in front of Isabella Evans at the restaurant.

Nor could she erase the memory of him shamelessly proposing she become his secret lover.

The boy who'd once risked everything to save her had become the person who hurt her most.

Ethan's face darkened.

"When did you become so heartless, Sophia?"

She nearly laughed aloud.

"Ethan, have you forgotten who cheated first?"

Her gaze locked onto his.

"You're the one who couldn't let go of your first love. You're the one who denied our relationship in public."

His expression froze.

After a long pause, he murmured, "That was just acting for appearances."

Suddenly, the man before her felt like a complete stranger.

Tired of rehashing the past, she cut to the chase. "Why are you really here today?"

Seeing her stance soften slightly, hope flickered in his eyes.

"Sophia, there's really nothing between Isabella and me."

His voice took on a coaxing tone.

"Let's stop this nonsense and get back together."
###Chapter 67

The staff around them pricked up their ears, their gazes darting between the three figures.

The air was thick with tension.

Before Ethan Winston could finish speaking, Nathan Lowell had already stepped protectively in front of Sophia Laurent.

"Are you deaf, Winston?"

His glare was sharp as a blade. "Sophia wants nothing to do with you right now."

Ethan's eyes turned icy.

"Compared to me, it's the Lowell family she's desperate to escape from, isn't it?"

He stared Nathan down, his voice dripping with sarcasm.

These past days, he'd been closely monitoring Sophia's situation.

From Emily Lowell exposing family matters, to the online backlash, and finally that disownment notice.

He understood Sophia's resolve better than anyone.

But could blood ties truly be severed so easily?

This was merely a power play against Nathan.

Nathan scoffed.

"Whatever happens, she'll always be my sister. Who do you think you are?"

A cold smile curved Ethan's lips.

"I'm the man she loved for three years, and will love for a lifetime. In terms of closeness, shouldn't you know your place?"

Sophia stood between them, her temples throbbing.

"Are you two done yet?"

She took two steps back. "Both of you, get lost."

If Ethan had chased after her to explain at the birthday banquet that day...

Perhaps she might have given him a chance to speak.

But now, it was too late.

She couldn't care less.

Unless they came to ask about the baby, she couldn't be bothered.

A sudden tightness gripped her chest.

"Sophia, ignore them."

A soothing voice interjected at just the right moment.

Adrian Valentine stood beside her, his gaze gentle.

"I've reserved a restaurant. Shall we go?"

Sophia's tense nerves relaxed slightly.

"Sure."

Adrian's smile deepened.

"This way. I know a great private kitchen."

They walked away side by side.

Two pairs of eyes burned holes into their retreating backs.

Adrian suddenly turned and gave them a meaningful smile.

Nathan and Ethan's faces darkened instantly.

As Sophia moved further away, Nathan gritted his teeth and followed.

Ethan remained rooted to the spot, unmoving.

He couldn't understand.

After swallowing his pride to reconcile, why was Sophia still treating him this way?

Where was the girl who used to adore him with her whole heart?

Everyone in their circle knew how deeply she'd loved him.

Over such a trivial matter, she'd changed just like that?

He'd thought she was merely throwing a tantrum.

Now it seemed her heart had long flown elsewhere.

And the culprit was undoubtedly Adrian Valentine!

Clenching his fists, Ethan strode after them.
###Chapter 68

Sophia Laurent had just settled by the window when Adrian Valentine handed her the menu.

She reached for it, then froze mid-motion. Two familiar figures appeared at the entrance.

Her fingers stilled.

Adrian followed her gaze, his brow furrowing.

"Waiter," he signaled, "we'll take a private room."

He'd chosen the main dining area to protect Sophia's reputation.

These unexpected guests changed everything.

He recognized Nathan Lowell. The other man must be Sophia's ex.

The waiter bowed. "This way, please."

Sophia rose without hesitation.

She refused to even glance in their direction.

"Sophia!"

Nathan intercepted them.

"Now you won't even share a meal with me?"

Her laugh was icy.

She'd never met anyone so oblivious.

"Blind?"

Adrian stepped between them. "Can't you see she finds you repulsive?"

Sophia nodded. "The sight of you makes me sick."

Ethan Winston stood behind Nathan, his eyes glinting with mockery.

He opened his mouth, but Sophia's glacial stare silenced him.

"As for you," her voice was soft, "be a decent ex."

Her lips twisted in self-deprecation.

"Wait—we were never even that."

She turned on her heel.

Adrian shot them both a withering look before following.

Nathan and Ethan stood rooted to the spot.

"Winston," Nathan gritted out, "stay away from Sophia."

Ethan scoffed. "She's already cut ties with your family."

"At least we shared good memories. What do you have?"

He knew Sophia's soft heart.

The slightest kindness lingered in her memory.

He refused to believe she'd moved on so quickly.

Nathan fell silent.

Neither noticed the camera capturing everything from the shadows.

Valdemar Sanatorium.

Henry Chamberlain waved a tablet at the hospital bed.

"Mr. Valdemar, your wife is actually Composer T!"

"Check out how this guy looks at her. Tsk."

"Breaking news! Someone chased her to the show's set!"

Alexander Valdemar: "......"

Since his condition improved, Henry had abandoned all professional restraint.
###Chapter 69

Alexander lay motionless on the hospital bed, his ears ringing.

"Shut up."

His eyes snapped open, voice icy.

Henry immediately fell silent.

Since regaining consciousness, Alexander had drifted in and out of sleep for days. At least he was awake now, easing Henry's burden considerably.

After concluding a business meeting at noon, Henry had come to the sanatorium to unwind. His girlfriend kept bombarding him with celebrity gossip, which he'd ignored.

Until Sophia's name appeared.

He couldn't resist sharing the updates with Alexander—Emily instigating online attacks against Sophia, the truth coming to light, the restaurant scene with three men surrounding Sophia.

Both he and Patriarch Valdemar had known about Sophia's boyfriend. Neither expected she'd ultimately marry into the Valdemar family.

Henry stole a glance at Alexander's stern profile and wisely closed his mouth.

The room plunged into silence.

"Any news on Tiffany?" Alexander asked abruptly.

Henry straightened. "We're screening all girls by that name. Should complete within a month. No guarantee she's among them."

Alexander's gaze darkened.

"And... Miss Laurent's situation?" Henry ventured. "The marriage paperwork was handled by the Patriarch. Should we—"

"Unnecessary."

Alexander's tone was dismissive.

His periods of lucidity remained limited, preventing him from managing company affairs. This hospitalization conveniently exposed those with ulterior motives.

The longer outsiders believed him comatose, the sooner they'd reveal themselves.

With the marriage already publicized, divorce would only raise suspicions now.

"Don't mention her around me again."

Alexander closed his eyes.

Henry nodded hastily.

A bodyguard's voice sounded outside. "Madam, you've arrived."

Sophia stood at the doorway, responding softly.
###Chapter 70

The hospital room was so quiet you could hear the IV drip.

Henry Chamberlain heard footsteps outside and instinctively glanced at Alexander Valdemar lying in the bed.

Alexander's eyes remained closed, his breathing steady with no signs of waking.

Sophia Laurent pushed open the door.

"Madam." Henry immediately straightened his posture, his expression respectful.

"Mr. Chamberlain." Sophia gave a slight nod.

The air grew heavy again.

She had come straight from the television station without even removing her makeup.

Ethan Winston and Nathan Lowell had been waiting for her backstage, but she'd taken a detour to leave.

Now the person she knew best in Riverdale was actually Patriarch Valdemar.

Sophia stared at the man in the hospital bed.

Alexander's eyelashes cast faint shadows under the light.

She wished he would wake up soon.

Then she could finally end this farce of a marriage.

The Valdemars had already delivered their promised benefits to the Lowells.

All she had to do was play her part until the curtain fell.

As for love?

A self-deprecating smile tugged at Sophia's lips.

Henry stole a glance at her profile.

Why was she staring at Mr. Valdemar like that?

Unless...

He quickly dismissed the thought.

Rumor had it Sophia had been madly in love with her ex-boyfriend.

So what did that expression mean now?

Sophia felt Henry's probing gaze.

She'd only intended to take a quick look before leaving.

Now she had to stay longer.

Alexander's fingers twitched imperceptibly beneath the sheets.

The atmosphere between the three grew increasingly strange.

The silence wasn't broken until the housekeeper came to summon Sophia for dinner.

"Sophia's here." Patriarch Valdemar set down his teacup. "Have you encountered any difficulties lately?"

Sophia froze.

She shook her head. "Thank you for your concern, Grandfather. I'm fine."

Yet warmth bloomed in her chest.

This was the first time anyone had asked if she needed help.

In the Lowell household, no one had ever cared about her circumstances.

The Lowell mansion blazed with light.

Crystal chandeliers made the marble floors gleam.

Richard Lowell's face was stormy. "Where's Sophia?"

Nathan tugged at his tie irritably. "She refused to come back."
###Chapter 71

Nathan Lowell stood gloomily in the center of the living room. "If she won't come back, should I send someone to drag her here?"

Everyone in the Lowell family now knew about Sophia Laurent's secret identity as the famous composer T, except Christopher who was still filming on set.

Daniel Lowell merely gave a noncommittal hum, continuing to work on his documents.

Richard Lowell and William Lowell both wore displeased expressions.

Sophia hiding such an important identity clearly showed she didn't consider them family.

What bothered them more was that Lowell Entertainment belonged to the Lowell Group.

If those song copyrights had been under the company, they could have launched several new artists and generated massive profits.

Richard snorted coldly. "What good would dragging her back do?"

He felt a suffocating anger in his chest. Sophia's deception made him feel disrespected.

William interjected indignantly: "She's truly an ungrateful wretch. Giving away all those copyrights to outsiders shows no family loyalty at all."

Nathan frowned slightly.

As a singer-songwriter himself, he understood what creative works meant to their creators.

"Father, brother, Sophia has every right to decide what to do with her own work."

William curled his lip dismissively. "Rights? With that talent, why didn't she prioritize developing artists from our own company first?"

Richard chimed in: "Exactly! Such shortsightedness! What's the worth of those petty copyright fees?"

Nathan remained silent.

In the past, he might have agreed with them.

But this time, he couldn't.

For the first time, he clearly saw Sophia's position in the Lowell family.

"I'm tired. I'm going upstairs."

He decided to investigate Sophia's claims.

The theft might be impossible to verify.

But school bullying that happened in public should be easy to confirm.

If Emily had truly done those things while they blindly defended her...

Just the thought sent chills down his spine.

William watched his younger brother ascend the stairs with a furrowed brow.

"What's wrong with Nathan lately? I heard when Emily fainted on set today, not only did he not personally take her to the hospital, but he also banned her from the show."

Normally, Nathan would seek out Emily first thing upon returning home.

Today, he went straight to his room.

Richard speculated: "Probably upset with Sophia."

He sighed heavily. "That girl is too stubborn."

William, recalling his own blood pressure spikes from dealing with Sophia, agreed wholeheartedly: "Her attitude will bring her trouble sooner or later."

Changing the subject, his expression turned grave.

"Father, Pearl Group has been poaching our clients frequently lately. I wonder who's backing them..."

What infuriated him most was their repeated successes, leaving him scrambling to contain the damage. Even shareholders had begun questioning his competence.

The mere thought of Oliver Granger's smug face made William's blood boil.

His resentment toward Sophia grew stronger too.

Richard's face darkened. "That's the company Sophia works for now?"

William nodded. "Yes."

The atmosphere in the living room instantly froze.

Victoria Lowell, who had been silent until now, spoke up timidly:

"Richard, William, there's something I'd like to ask for your help with."
###Chapter 72

Richard Lowell's expression softened slightly after hearing Victoria's words.

"Victoria, speak plainly. No need for formalities."

Seeing his attitude relax, Victoria finally let out the breath she'd been holding.

If Sophia could casually produce nine million, surely they had access to funds too?

"That card Sophia gave me... I assumed it had no spending limit, so I made a few purchases..."

Her voice trailed off.

"Now she's not only frozen the card but is threatening to sue me for repayment..."

Richard's brow furrowed.

"She dared freeze your card? And sue you?"

Victoria nodded weakly.

Bang!

Richard slammed the table and stood abruptly. "The audacity! Does she forget her family name after marrying into the Valdemars?"

William remained stone-faced, recalling the previous incident when his mother had demanded three million. He stayed silent.

Victoria didn't dare respond either.

"Don't repay a cent! Would she actually sue her own mother? The scandal would ruin her!"

Victoria wrung her hands anxiously.

She couldn't comprehend her daughter's heartlessness.

"The court summons arrived. She's serious this time. Perhaps... we should just repay the amount?"

Richard's chest tightened with anger.

Ever since forcing Sophia into marriage with the Valdemars, nothing had gone right for the Lowells.

"Countless women would kill for that marriage. What's her problem?"

He poured himself tea irritably.

"Fine. Return whatever you spent. No point straining relations over petty cash."

They still needed Sophia to compose songs for Lowell Entertainment.

Cultivating more cash cows was the priority.

Relief washed over Victoria's features.

"My funds are tight right now. Could you cover it temporarily?"

Jail didn't frighten her—but the humiliation would be unbearable.

Richard nodded. "How much?"

Compared to future earnings, this was pocket change.

Sophia was the legendary Composer T, capable of carrying Lowell Entertainment to new heights.

Victoria relaxed completely.

"About nine million over the past few years. Let's just round it to nine."

Clatter!

Richard's hand jerked, scalding tea splashing his skin as the cup shattered.

"How much?!"

William inhaled sharply.

Nine million in three years? No property or vehicles purchased—where did the money go?

Victoria shrank under their stares. "N-nine million... Is that... problematic?"

Richard gaped at her, finally processing the number. "Nine million? What exactly did you spend it on?"
###Chapter 73

"Nine million?" Richard Lowell's eyes widened, his teacup nearly slipping from his grasp.

His fingers trembled slightly as he repeatedly flipped through the bill.

William Lowell stood nearby, his expression conflicted. "Dad, Composer T's going rate has been over five million per composition these past two years."

Victoria Lowell sat curled in the sofa corner, wringing her hands. "I only bought some clothes and handbags..."

"You call this 'some'?" Richard slammed the table. "Nine million could buy an apartment!"

Victoria lifted her tear-reddened eyes. "Are you both blaming me now?"

The air turned glacial.

William cleared his throat. "Mom, perhaps you could apologize to Sophia?"

"Yes, exactly," Richard quickly agreed. "That girl always falls for that approach."

Victoria let out a bitter laugh.

Sophia's words - "if I had a choice" - echoed in her mind.

So everyone knew Sophia craved familial love.

Yet no one was willing to give it.

"You expect me to shoulder this alone?" Victoria's voice shook.

Richard rubbed his hands nervously. "I've invested everything in 'River Banquet'..."

William studied the floor. "I just transferred money to Emily..."

Victoria abruptly stood.

Without a word, she turned toward the stairs.

As the bedroom door clicked shut, searing pain shot through her.

She staggered toward the vanity.

The medicine box clattered to the floor.

White pills scattered like fallen snow.
###Chapter 74

Victoria Lowell's migraines were chronic.

Each episode felt like a hammer pounding inside her skull, leaving her drenched in cold sweat. She'd visited every major hospital, undergone CT scans and MRIs—all results came back normal.

Sophia Laurent somehow discovered an elderly Chinese medicine practitioner and insisted on taking her for a consultation. The doctor prescribed dark herbal pills with an unpleasant odor.

Victoria had scoffed at the time, tossing the medication into a drawer.

One midnight when the pain became unbearable, she reluctantly swallowed one pill. Miraculously, the agony subsided within thirty minutes.

Assuming it was coincidence, she tested the remedy several more times before confirming its efficacy.

Over the past two years, the headaches had become infrequent enough to fade from memory.

As the current episode eased, her recollections grew sharper. She remembered chastising Sophia for meddling that day at the clinic while her daughter remained silent with that impassive expression.

The memory now weighed on Victoria's conscience like a stone.

She had to admit—her biological daughter had treated her far better than she deserved.

While she had...

Rubbing her temples, Victoria picked up her phone and dialed Emily Lowell.

"Sweetheart..."

Emily was touching up her makeup in the dressing room. Today had been disastrous—first Nathan Lowell's production team replaced her without notice, then she'd been blackmailed before finally squeezing money from Christopher Lowell.

Seeing the caller ID, she forced sweetness into her voice. "Mom? What's wrong?"

Victoria cut to the chase. "You know about your sister suing me? I'm short on funds right now. Could you—"

Emily's grip tightened around her powder puff.

"Mom, I'm strapped for cash too..."

"Just transfer whatever you can spare. I need to repay Sophia." Victoria's tone turned urgent.

Emily's eyes flashed with irritation as she sweetened her voice further. "I sent you 1.5 million last month. My account only has 20,000 left for daily expenses now..."

Victoria sounded stunned. "How can you be broke with your current popularity?"
###Chapter 75

Emily Lowell curled her lips into a cold smile as she listened to the incessant chatter on the phone.

Her fingers tapped lightly against the desk, though her voice remained sweet and gentle. "Mom, my acting fees are split with the agency, and maintaining my image is expensive. I really don't have much savings..."

Every penny in her account had been painstakingly accumulated. Why should she give it away?

Even when she'd been blackmailed before, she'd made that idiot Christopher foot the bill.

"Mom, don't worry. I'll ask a friend for help..."

Victoria Lowell sighed. "Fine."

The moment the call ended, Emily dialed William Lowell's number.

"Big brother..." Her voice trembled with fake tears. "Mom suddenly asked me for money, and I just don't have it..."

William set down his pen mid-document. "Don't cry. I'll handle it."

Emily sniffled. "Could you lend me some? I'll pay you back—"

"No need." William rubbed his temples. "Mom's just upset because of Sophia."

After hanging up, Emily repeated the act with Daniel and Christopher.

Just as expected, both brothers were furious on her behalf.

Emily set her phone down, a flicker of mockery in her eyes.

Trying to take her money? Dream on.

The Lowell fortune was hers. Handing over shares to Sophia last time had already been agonizing.

Victoria clutched her phone, an emptiness settling in her chest.

She remembered how Sophia had transferred the money without hesitation—and how her adoptive daughter had made excuses.

All her children owned properties. Selling one would solve everything.

The phone rang abruptly.

"Mom!" Christopher's voice crackled with anger. "Stop harassing Emily for money! Do you know how hard she works?"

Victoria's fingers trembled.

"I'm killing myself on set, and all you do is spend recklessly!"
###Chapter 76

Victoria Lowell's fingers turned pale as she gripped her phone.

Christopher Lowell's voice carried clear displeasure through the receiver.

"Mom, how could you?"

Her heart plummeted.

"What did I do?"

Her voice trembled slightly.

"You demanded nine million from Emily? Where would she get that kind of money?"

His tone dripped with accusation.

Victoria's chest tightened.

Memories surfaced of her four sons repeatedly blaming Sophia Laurent for Emily's sake.

Had Sophia felt this same suffocating pain back then?

"So you're here to defend her?"

Her voice suddenly steadied.

Christopher hesitated.

"Emily didn't even know I was calling. I found out on my own."

"Oh?"

Victoria's laugh held no warmth.

"What exactly did she tell you?"

"She just asked to borrow money. I had to pry the truth out of her—"

His impatience bled through.

"Do you know why I asked her for the money?"

Victoria interrupted.

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"Whatever the reason, you shouldn't pressure her like this."

Ice settled in Victoria's veins.

"I've raised you all these years. Spent tens of millions on you."

Her voice dropped to a whisper.

"Now when I need help, I can't even ask?"

Christopher faltered.

"That's not what I meant—"

"Then what did you mean?"

She countered.

"Just leave Emily alone. She genuinely doesn't have the funds."

His tone softened.

"Fine."

Victoria suddenly laughed.

"Then you pay it."

Another prolonged silence.

"What do you need the money for anyway?"

Confusion colored his words.

"Debts."

She answered casually.

"Unless you'd prefer I go to prison."

"What?!"

Christopher gasped.

"Who do you owe? Does Dad know?"

"Of course he knows."

Her reply came calmly.

The line went completely silent.

Victoria waited, then chuckled darkly to herself.
###Chapter 77

"So Emily Lowell is a struggling actress with no money, and you, a top idol, can't spare any either?" Victoria Lowell's voice carried a hint of bitterness.

Christopher Lowell's ears burned with embarrassment. He quickly changed the subject.

"Mom, first tell me clearly. Who exactly do you owe money to? Were you scammed?"

"No one scammed me." Victoria's expression turned icy. "I embezzled Sophia Laurent's money. Now I need to return it."

"What?!"

Christopher's face darkened at the mention of Sophia.

"Her again! Why won't she leave us alone? Must she stir up trouble in this family? What right does she have to demand money from you?"

Victoria felt a chill watching her son's instant rage.

Sophia was his biological sister.

Yet he spoke of her like she was an enemy.

"Christopher, Sophia is your blood sister. What kind of attitude is this?"

She suddenly realized all her sons had developed this same hostile expression when mentioning Sophia.

"Hah!" Christopher sneered. "I wish I never had such a sister."

Victoria trembled with anger, her blood pressure spiking.

"You ungrateful brat!"

She shouted sharply. "Never let me hear those words again!"

"If it weren't for Sophia, would our family be in this state? Why can't I say it?"

Victoria couldn't bear to listen further and hung up.

She collapsed onto the sofa, chest heaving violently.

Before she could recover, her second son Daniel called.

His words mirrored Christopher's, though delivered more gently.

But the underlying message still blamed her for asking Emily for money.

As if she'd committed some unforgivable sin.

Darkness clouded Victoria's vision from rage.

When she finally composed herself enough to eat dinner, her eldest son William brought it up again.

"Mom, didn't I tell you? No matter how Sophia acts up, she'd never actually let you go to jail. Why must you trouble Emily?"

Victoria lost her appetite instantly.

William continued relentlessly.

"How much could a young girl like Emily possibly have saved? She's always walked on eggshells in our family. How could you do this for Sophia—"

Smack!

Victoria slammed her chopsticks down.

"William Lowell, search your conscience!"

"Since childhood, hasn't every luxury gone to Emily first?"

"The clothes and jewelry I bought her must be worth millions at least."

"Since when has she ever 'walked on eggshells' in this house?"

Victoria had genuinely doted on Emily.

She'd even gifted her own bridal jewelry to the girl.

Money had never been spared for Emily's wants.

William fell silent, unable to refute.

Nathan, who'd remained quiet until now, finally spoke. "Mom, what's really going on?"

Victoria couldn't bother with pretense anymore.

"I needed money and hoped you could help. Instead, all I got were accusations..."
###Chapter 78

Victoria Lowell's fingers absently traced the rim of her teacup as she spoke.

The tea had long gone cold, but she didn't notice.

Her mind drifted back to that moment when Emily Lowell had stood before her with red-rimmed eyes, whispering, "Mom, I'm really out of money."

A simple conversation, yet her three sons had pounced like protective beasts, hurling accusations at her.

The scene felt eerily familiar.

Just like when Sophia Laurent had been surrounded by the entire family, subjected to their relentless criticism.

Nathan Lowell stared blankly at his phone screen.

The hashtag #LowellSwitchedAtBirth still trended, its origins tracing back to his live stream.

William Lowell opened his mouth, then turned away in silence.

"Victoria," Richard Lowell suddenly grasped his wife's hand. "Sophia has always been soft-hearted. A little coaxing is all it'll take."

He lowered his voice. "The more she resists, the more it proves she still cares."

William immediately agreed. "Exactly. Blood ties can't be severed so easily. She's just throwing a tantrum—"

Victoria watched the pale light of dawn through the window, her fingers trembling slightly.

Maybe... there was still hope?

As morning mist lingered, Sophia spotted the mother and son waiting outside the studio.

"Sophia..."

Victoria held a thermal container, her smile tentative.

Sophia didn't pause.

"Mrs. Lowell. Business?"

The formal address drained the color from Victoria's face.

Nathan stepped forward, barely containing his irritation.

"Mom made your favorite seafood congee."

His tone was uncharacteristically gentle, as if soothing a temperamental cat.

Sophia laughed.

So the untouchable Nathan Lowell could speak like a normal person.

Too late.

"I'm an orphan. You must have me confused with someone else."

Nathan grabbed her wrist.

"Say that again."

Sophia studied the veins bulging on his hand, her smile widening.

"There it is."

She effortlessly twisted free.

"Did you really think..."

Morning light caught her lashes, casting icy shadows.

"...I'd come crawling back for scraps of affection?"

The container hit the ground with a dull thud.

Fragrant steam rose from the spilled congee.

"Only the favored dare act so recklessly."

Sophia stepped over the warm puddle.

"Your regret now only proves one thing..."

When she turned, the rising sun burned in her eyes.

"...the discarded pawn has become the queen."
###Chapter 79

Victoria Lowell and Nathan Lowell's faces turned deathly pale, then flushed crimson in an instant.

Victoria's lips trembled as she tried to explain, "Sophia, I truly want to make amends this time..."

Her voice choked with emotion. "I promise I'll treat you fairly from now on..."

"Make amends?"

Sophia Laurent's lips curled into a cold smirk.

"Do you even deserve that?"

Her gaze was sharp as a blade. "Do you know why I craved family love so desperately?"

She enunciated each word clearly. "Because I never truly had it."

"Now I see through you—you're nothing but parasites."

Victoria finally snapped.

"Sophia Laurent! Don't you dare disrespect us!"

Nathan was equally furious.

"Got a little fame and now you're too good for us?"

Sophia gave them an icy glance.

"Believe whatever you want."

Victoria shook with rage.

"Your father is an internationally renowned director! Do you really think we need you?"

Sophia turned and walked away without a backward glance.

Bystanders had already captured the entire scene on video.

The footage quickly went viral.

Public opinion instantly split into two camps.

How could she be so ungrateful?
Her own mother apologized—what more does she want?
She's definitely putting on an act for the cameras!
But Sophia has a point.
When will they return the nine million?
...

The Lowell siblings had a massive fan base.

Soon, the tide of public opinion turned overwhelmingly against Sophia.

Director Richard must be cursed with such a daughter!
The whole family is talented—she's the only black sheep!
They should've cut ties with her long ago!
...

Coincidentally, Richard Lowell was holding a promotional event for his new film.

A reporter asked pointedly, "Director Lowell, is Composer T really severing ties with you?"

Richard smiled warmly.

"She's always been rebellious since childhood. We're at our wits' end."

He sighed. "We're doing just fine without her."
###Chapter 80

Richard Lowell's statement was like a boulder crashing into still waters, sending shockwaves through the public.

Online discussions exploded instantly.

"Director Lowell's words carry hidden meanings."

"It seems Sophia Laurent truly isn't welcomed in the Lowell family."

"Even her own uncle says this. Her personality must be terrible."

The comment section flooded with speculation.

As the controversy grew, an explosive post appeared.

#In-Depth Analysis: The Truth About Nathan Lowell's Musical Talent#

The post meticulously analyzed the "We Are Singers" performance.

It started with Nathan's shocked expression upon seeing Sophia.

The key point highlighted his mediocre original version of "Spring Love Song."

The song transformed completely after Sophia's live arrangement.

The author was clearly a seasoned music professional.

They compared Nathan's hit songs with Composer T's works.

"Professional analysis shows Nathan's top ten songs were all reworked by Composer T."

This conclusion detonated like a bomb.

Comments erupted immediately.

"So Nathan and Adrian Valentine's songs actually came from Composer T?"

"No wonder their styles are so similar!"

"The original "Spring Love Song" was painfully average."

Music experts weighed in:

"Nathan's live performance lacked emotional depth."

"The rearranged version showcased the 'Nathan' quality we know."

This revelation went viral.

Media outlets scrambled to report.

#Nathan Lowell's Musical Talent Questioned#

#Composer T: The Real Mastermind#

#The Truth About the Lowell Siblings' Musical Abilities#

Trending topics were dominated overnight.

Nathan's fanbase fractured.

"Our idol's talent is undeniable!"

"He wrote those songs himself!"

But doubts crept in.

"The difference between versions is too stark."

"Have we been loving Composer T's work all along?"

Industry professionals spoke out.

"Objectively, Nathan's original compositions lack brilliance."

"The rearranged versions elevate them significantly."

The storm intensified.

Music platform data shifted noticeably.

Nathan's streams declined sharply.

Composer T's works saw dramatic spikes.

This debate about musical authenticity was reshaping the industry.
###Chapter 81

The announcement of the second round finals sent shockwaves across social media. Netizens were abuzz with speculation about what Nathan Lowell could possibly deliver without Sophia Laurent's involvement.

Tension crackled in the studio air. Sophia had chosen Adrian Valentine and a shy girl from a small northwestern town as her protégés, while Nathan partnered with an industry veteran.

This round introduced an unconventional challenge. Mentors and students had just half a day to co-create original pieces for the prime-time finals at 8 PM.

The judges' panel of "We Are Singers" boasted music industry heavyweights. Among the seasoned mentors, Sophia stood out as the sole young contender.

Live feeds showcased the creative frenzy in most practice rooms. Only Nathan's studio remained eerily silent.

The cameras captured Nathan's brooding expression, starkly contrasting Sophia's lively team next door.

Adrian's natural admiration for Sophia kept the energy vibrant. The reserved northwestern girl, though quiet, gazed at her mentor with undisguised reverence.

Sophia gave her students creative freedom. She offered guidance without imposing changes, preserving their artistic visions.

Time evaporated. By 7:30 PM, the live stream viewership had surpassed ten million.

Contestants drew performance slots amid fervent live comments:

"Half-day creation? They must be using pre-made tracks!"
"More curious about Nathan's performance."
"Let's see what he's got without Sophia's help."

Adrian took the stage first. Shattering his preliminary round persona, he delivered a powerhouse original anthem brimming with raw passion.

His voice radiated pure musical devotion, electrifying the audience.

The comment section exploded:
"Stunning transformation!"
"Goosebumps all over!"
"Next up - Nathan! Bring him on!"
###Chapter 82

The stage lights suddenly focused on Nathan Lowell as he walked slowly to the center.

The entire studio fell silent.

The flood of live comments visibly slowed down.

Everyone held their breath, waiting for the performance.

The prelude to "Child" began to play softly.

Nathan's deep voice flowed through the air.

The song told a story about growing distant from parents during adolescence.

When it reached the chorus, the melody abruptly became intense.

Some audience members frowned.

"This modulation..."

"Too abrupt."

The professional judges exchanged glances.

The live chat exploded with comments.

"Isn't this Composer T's signature style?"

"The imitation is too obvious."

"And the chorus sounds overdone."

Many in the audience were music students.

They immediately noticed the disharmony.

"Without that awkward modulation..."

"This song would be on par with Sophia's original 'Spring Love Song'."

This realization made many people thoughtful.

Nathan's fans remained unusually quiet in the chat.

Only a few superficial fans still defended him.

The judges' panel fell into brief silence.

Finally, Nathan's mentor cleared his throat.

"The lyrics have depth..."

"Experimenting with new styles is commendable..."

His praise sounded restrained.

Then Adrian Valentine suddenly raised his microphone.

"Nathan—"

He deliberately drew out the last syllable.

Nathan shot him a cold glare.

"I have a question."

Adrian ignored the warning look.

"Your previous works..."

"Were they all polished by Sophia?"

The words detonated like a bomb.

Every camera immediately focused on Nathan.

His expression froze.
###Chapter 83

The stage lights burned Nathan Lowell's eyes.

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the microphone. His throat was too dry to speak.

Adrian Valentine tilted his head with an amused smirk.

"Composer T, is the question too difficult?" He waved the sheet music. "Or perhaps... these edits aren't yours?"

Whispers rippled through the audience.

Nathan's gaze involuntarily drifted to the judges' panel.

Sophia Laurent was writing notes without glancing his way.

"Collaboration is normal in creative processes," Adrian suddenly shifted tone. "But..."

He deliberately drew out the pause.

"Claiming someone else's work as your own crosses the line."

Gasps filled the venue.

Nathan's head snapped up, face ashen.

"Adrian Valentine!"

He spat the name through clenched teeth.

Adrian only smiled wider.

"Oh dear, did I misspeak?" He feigned surprise, covering his mouth. "Unless... those rumors are true?"

The screen cut to Sophia's close-up.

She finally looked up with dead calm eyes.

"Sophia." Nathan's voice cracked. "You tell them."

He gambled on lingering sibling loyalty.

Sophia set down her pen.

"Adrian's correct."

Her quiet words detonated through the studio.

"For three years, I revised every competition entry you submitted."

The audience erupted.

Nathan staggered back.

"Lies!" He shouted. "Those were my original works!"

Sophia produced a stack of papers from her folder.

"Shall I display the drafts?"

Her finger tapped the dated margins.

"Every revision is timestamped."

Live comments exploded.

[OMG receipts!]
[So his Composer T awards were hers?]
[Explains his recent quality drop...]

Nathan stared at the damning evidence.

He remembered Sophia working late nights at her desk.

Where had he been?

Accompanying Emily Lowell shopping.

"Why..." His voice trembled. "Now?"

Sophia filed the documents coolly.

"You've exhausted all chances."

She addressed the judges.

"I move to disqualify Nathan Lowell."

Adrian whistled.

"Seconded."

The panel exchanged nods.

The host cleared his throat.

"Per competition rules, plagiarism warrants lifetime ban."

Nathan jerked upright.

"I didn't plagiarize! That's my sist—"

"Former sister." Sophia corrected. "Since you chose Emily."

The screen switched to backstage footage.

Emily was frantically deleting text messages:

[Don't worry babe, I bribed the judges]
[You'll win for sure]

Dead silence.

Sophia chuckled.

"Someone's panicking faster than expected."
###Chapter 84

In this era of information explosion, any ripple can spread across the internet in an instant.

The truth about Nathan Lowell's viral hit song finally came to light.

The melody that had captivated millions owed its brilliance to Sophia Laurent's stroke of genius.

Music forums erupted first.

"I always thought Nathan was a creative prodigy, but..."

"Those melodies I had on repeat were actually Sophia's work?"

"From today, I'm switching my allegiance to Sophia."

Nathan Lowell's fanbase was in turmoil.

A flood of music enthusiasts began unfollowing him.

Meanwhile, Sophia's social media followers skyrocketed.

Her comment section was instantly overwhelmed.

"This is what real musical talent looks like!"

"Beautiful and brilliant—total package!"

Live stream chats scrolled like falling snow.

But soon, the tone shifted subtly.

"Talent means nothing without character."

"The Lowells are all gifted. Richard's 'Lone Mountain' is the real classic."

"Heard 'River Banquet' is Quentin Shaw's team behind it?"

"Expectations through the roof!"

These comments came fast and furious.

In Lowell Entertainment's conference room, the PR team delivered their latest report.

"Director Lowell, the publicity has exceeded expectations."

"The whole internet is buzzing about 'River Banquet.'"

The lead hesitated.

"Though... the negative impact on Miss Sophia..."

William Lowell cut him off with a cold laugh.

"She brought it on herself."

"Without the Lowell name, she's nothing."

Richard Lowell didn't look up from his reports.

"If she dares to provoke, she must face the consequences."

"Ramp up the promotion."

He closed the folder, his gaze icy.

"Let everyone learn that in this industry, capital rules supreme."
###Chapter 85

The manager bowed respectfully. "Director Lowell, Mr. Lowell, I'll attend to other matters now."

Soon, only Richard Lowell and William Lowell remained in the office.

Richard stared at the rising popularity metrics of "River Banquet" on his computer screen, a satisfied smirk playing on his lips.

"Nathan, we owe this acquisition to your connections. Snatching the rights from Quentin Shaw wasn't easy..."

His expression suddenly darkened.

"That Sophia actually opposed buying this project. I wonder what game she's playing."

William scoffed dismissively.

"What business acumen does a woman have? Writing a few songs doesn't make her an expert."

"When "River Banquet" released its synopsis, every studio was scrambling for it. Lowell Entertainment secured it for thirty million."

Richard swirled his wine glass triumphantly.

William nodded. "Quentin's team is highly sought-after. Good thing we moved fast."

The mention made Richard grumble again.

"Sophia wanted me to wait? For what? I've had no projects for half a year!"

"What does she know about business? Women are so indecisive..."

Meanwhile, at the "We Are Singers" recording set.

After receiving confirmation from Nathan and Sophia, Adrian Valentine's smile widened.

"Who would've thought the revered 'Composer T' is just a fraud. Without Sophia, you're nothing."

His expression turned sharp.

"Nathan, if "Spring Love Song" and that unedited "Child's Play" represent your true skills, you're no match for me."

He paused, then added coldly:

"Though it's your family matter, I must say - you're a terrible brother."

His words ignited the internet.

Live comments flooded the screen:

How dare Adrian criticize others?
Publicly bashing competitors shows poor character
Their sibling relationship is none of his business
Nathan's fans tried defending him but were overwhelmed by Adrian's supporters:

He's just stating facts
Without Sophia, Nathan is indeed nothing
Adrian's defending his idol. Jealous much?
As the online war escalated, Lucas Sheridan brought Sophia backstage.

He showed her the promotional articles praising "River Banquet" while disparaging her.

Sophia's brow furrowed slightly.

She studied Lucas quietly, lost in thought.
###Chapter 86

Lucas Sheridan observed Sophia Laurent's shifting expressions in silence.

As the show's director, he had witnessed all the recent turmoil.

Though unaware of the Lowell family's internal conflicts, their cruel treatment of Sophia was unmistakable.

Years in the entertainment industry had sharpened his instincts—the targeted hate in the live comments was clearly orchestrated.

The mastermind behind it was obvious.

"Sophia, if you want to address the rumors about Director Lowell, I can give you a few minutes."

The online backlash against her was brutal.

Richard Lowell's remarks were deliberate character assassination. A simple explanation or even a hint of the family's mistreatment could turn the tide.

Lucas maintained a neutral tone, but Sophia sensed his genuine concern.

His offer to break protocol for her sake warmed her heart.

A faint smile touched her lips.

Since leaving the Lowells, she had found more sincerity elsewhere.

Her clenched fingers relaxed as resolve settled in.

"Director Sheridan, are you interested in making a film?"

This was meant to be Richard's gift. Not anymore.

Lucas blinked, caught off guard by the abrupt shift.

"Of course."

Though now a variety show director, every filmmaker dreamed of the silver screen.

Who didn't want to create a masterpiece, stand on that podium, and hold a Best Director trophy?

But his past films had underperformed, driving investors away.

Those days were a struggle.

Only after switching to variety shows did he regain footing.

He'd been searching for the right script—either the stories didn't resonate or budgets fell short.

Sophia's voice was soft but firm. "I have a screenplay. Would you discuss it after the show?"

Surprise flickered in Lucas's eyes.

"Absolutely."

He doubted she had anything groundbreaking, but Sophia's contributions had made this show a hit.

For that, he'd give her the time.

"We'll talk then."

"Sure."

Lucas hesitated. "About what I mentioned earlier—"

Sophia understood. "Thank you, but let's not waste precious airtime."

Her gaze hardened. "I'll handle it myself."

Those online comments glorifying Richard while vilifying her?

She'd see how far his doomed "River Banquet" could go.

By the time she returned to set, "We Are Singers" was nearing its finale.

The host beamed. "The audience votes are in! Ready for the results?"

Hurry up!
I just want to see where Nathan Lowell's pretentious "Child" ranks...
The crowd's eager response made the host skip the suspense and announce the rankings immediately.
###Chapter 87

"The first prize of this Original Music Competition goes to Adrian Valentine's 'Fervor.' Second place is awarded to Melody Li's 'My Wandering Heart,' and third place belongs to Dream Xu's 'Reminiscence'..."

With each name announced, Nathan Lowell's expression darkened.

When the sixth place was called, murmurs rippled through the audience.

"Sixth place—Nathan Lowell's 'Child.'"

The result drew surprised glances from many.

But soon, the audience nodded in quiet understanding.

As a music student, I'd noticed the awkward key change in his chorus. Making the top ten was already a stroke of luck.

Every entry this year was produced in collaboration with top-tier industry professionals. The standard was exceptionally high.

Adrian shone like a supernova, grinning like an overjoyed child.

Who wouldn't be thrilled to collaborate with their idol?

Dream's performance was equally stunning. 'Reminiscence' showcased her unique vocal texture perfectly.

Amid the praise, someone pointed out a more intriguing detail.

Wait—both the first and second-place winners worked with Sophia Laurent?

No wonder they call her Composer T. Her talent is undeniable.

Nathan truly was blind to treat Sophia that way...

The comments section overflowed with admiration for Sophia and scathing critiques of Nathan.

His fan count plummeted visibly.

Only then did genuine panic grip Nathan.

After the recording, he intercepted Sophia before she could leave.

"Sophia, can we start over?"

His voice cracked. "I'll make it up to you."

She didn't even glance his way.

"Unnecessary."

The Lowells meant nothing to her now.

"Mom and Dad miss you. Come home for dinner?"

Sophia's lips curled into a cold smile.

Before she could respond, Lucas Sheridan's voice cut in.

"Sorry, she has plans tonight."

Nathan frowned at the director.

"Since when are you two so close?"

Sophia walked past him toward Lucas. "Let's go."

She owed no explanations.

Their retreating figures stabbed at Nathan's chest.

Adrian, lingering nearby, couldn't resist a jab. "Regrets now? Too late."

He'd also asked Sophia out—though rejected, he'd at least gotten her contact.

Nathan finally recognized the suffocating pain in his chest.

Regret.

If only he'd treated Sophia better...

But 'if only' changed nothing.
###Chapter 88

The crystal chandelier cast a soft glow over the restaurant.

Sophia pushed open the glass door and found Lucas already seated by the window.

"Director Sheridan."

She greeted him quietly before taking the chair the waiter pulled out for her.

"Sophia, take a look at the menu..."

Lucas slid the gilded menu toward her.

Her fingers brushed lightly over the pages as she accepted it.

"A medium-rare steak, please."

The waiter noted her order and retreated soundlessly.

Sophia took a sip of water and cut straight to the point.

"Director Sheridan, I have a script I'd like you to review."

She retrieved her phone from her bag and pulled up a document.

The title "Empress" stood out boldly on the screen.

Lucas accepted the phone with casual interest.

But as he read further, his posture gradually straightened.

"This..."

His fingers tapped absently against the tabletop.

The script told the story of a woman navigating a patriarchal society, overcoming obstacles to claim the throne.

The political intrigue was meticulously crafted, each of the protagonist's decisions fraught with tension.

Lucas's eyes brightened with growing excitement.

"Miss Laurent, who wrote this masterpiece?"

His voice vibrated with barely contained enthusiasm.

Sophia avoided answering directly.

"What do you think?"

"Brilliant!"

The word burst from him, nearly causing him to drop the phone.

"Political dramas of this caliber are rare these days."

He gestured animatedly.

"Audiences are tired of those romance stories masquerading as political intrigue."

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

"Then what do you think it's worth?"

Lucas considered for a moment.

"At least—"

"Ten million."

Sophia stated the figure outright.

"What?"

Lucas shot to his feet, his knee colliding with the table.

Ignoring the pain, he leaned forward urgently.

"You can secure that price?"

Sophia nodded.

"Yes."

Her fingertip tapped the table lightly.

"But there's one condition."

"Name it!"

"I'll be playing the female lead."

Lucas blinked, then laughed heartily.

"That goes without saying!"

He sat back down, lowering his voice.

"Actually, I was about to ask—this script..."

"I wrote it."

Sophia admitted calmly.

Lucas gaped at her, speechless.

The waiter chose that moment to arrive with her steak.

The silver knife gleamed coldly under the lights.

Sophia cut a small piece of meat and glanced up at Lucas, who still looked stunned.

"So... do we have a deal?"
###Chapter 89

Lucas Sheridan's grin stretched ear to ear. "Sophia, you're my lucky charm."

Not only had she made his variety show a nationwide hit, but now she'd brought him this brilliant movie script.

"Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me."

Sophia Laurent laughed at his exaggerated expression, her eyes crinkling into crescents.

The hotel had temporarily closed for filming, with all staff signing NDAs. They saw no need to maintain formal distance.

Neither noticed the figure lurking in the shadows with a phone raised.

The stalker was Nathan Lowell's obsessive fan, infatuated with his looks and wealthy background.

Watching Sophia chat animatedly with Lucas, she gritted her teeth and snapped photos.

What did breach fees matter?

Sophia's appearance on this show proved she'd slept her way in.

Nathan's public humiliation was all this bitch's fault.

What was wrong with a sister tweaking her brother's song? Why make it a national scandal?

This viper deserved to be ruined.

After dinner, Sophia began refining script details while Lucas rushed back to his studio, buzzing with new project plans.

That evening, scandal erupted.

#SHOCKING! Celebrity Director & Prodigy Composer's Secret Affair Exposed!#

The post vividly described their alleged backstage dealings, claiming the show was just Sophia's stepping stone into entertainment.

Carefully angled photos accompanied it - whispered conversations that appeared intimate, dining glances misinterpreted as flirtation.

The deceptive framing made their smiles seem laden with meaning.

Marketing accounts amplified the rumors, capitalizing on Sophia's recent fame.

Netizens exploded.

Director Lucas never smiles! Why's he so sweet to Sophia?

Desperate much? Lucas's daughter's in college...

Flashing that mistress status proudly? Poor Mrs. Sheridan.

They were just eating! No PDA at all. Chill.

Director Richard was right - trash like her belongs in the gutter.

Since when is smiling at someone cheating? Never smile again then!

...

As the storm raged, Richard Lowell quietly poured gasoline.

Instead of clarifying, he promoted his new film River Banquet using the controversy.

Lucas fired back:

@RichardLowell Focus on directing. Must you always climb over your daughter's back? Will you go bankrupt without this cheap publicity?

Richard instantly replied:

@LucasSheridan Name one masterpiece you've directed. x
###Chapter 90

Richard Lowell had been riding high since "Lone Mountain" swept through film festivals.

Wherever he went, he was surrounded by admirers, carrying himself like a cinematic maestro.

He looked down on variety show directors like Lucas Sheridan from the bottom of his heart.

And this time, Lucas had provoked him first—Richard's retort was justified.

The moment Richard's remarks went public, his fans swarmed in.

"A variety show director dares to talk about film art? What a joke!"

"Name one movie Lucas has directed. I can't recall a single one."

"Oh, I know him—the one who had that scandal with Sophia Laurent, right?"

"Jumping to defend so quickly? Does Lucas' wife know about this?"

Lucas' fans weren't about to take it lying down.

"Some people need to mind their own business. Having dinner equals an affair? Then you must be the queen of nightclubs."

"Is he even a real father? Too busy basking in his own glory to care about his daughter..."

"What rotten luck to have a father like that."

Netizens quickly shifted focus to the projects themselves.

"Trying to ride the hype before 'River Banquet' is even released? Lucas has no shame!"

"Funny! 'We Are Singers' is a cultural phenomenon. Who's piggybacking on whom?"

As the debate raged, Lucas suddenly updated his social media.

Lucas Sheridan: "My upcoming historical political drama 'Empress' is about to begin production. Stay tuned."

The announcement sent shockwaves across the internet.

Not only were netizens stunned, even Lucas' own fans were baffled.

"Director Lucas is returning to filmmaking?"

"Hah! A variety show director making movies? This is going to flop hard."

"Also a historical political drama? Is this a direct challenge to Richard Lowell?"

Richard's fans immediately piled on the mockery.

"Some people really overestimate themselves!"

"Too much variety TV has warped his sense of reality."

"Can't wait to see the train wreck Lucas produces!"

Meanwhile, Lucas was signing contracts with Sophia Laurent at Pearl Group.

He had intended to give Sophia time to consider.

But fearing complications, he swallowed his pride and sealed the deal on the spot.

After reading the full script, Lucas was awestruck.

Without hesitation, he signed the rights agreement—a ten-million-dollar buyout plus 5% of box office profits for the original writer.

"Credit the screenplay to Gavin Croix," Sophia said softly.

Lucas' eyes widened. "Gavin Croix? The writer of 'Lone Mountain'?"

Sophia gave a slight nod. "Yes."
###Chapter 91

Lucas Sheridan's gaze lingered on Sophia Laurent's face for a moment, a shadow of unreadable emotion flashing in his eyes.

This screenplay was undoubtedly something Sophia had specifically requested from Gavin Croix for Richard Lowell's sake.

Yet by some twist of fate, Richard had chosen Quentin Shaw's script instead, paying an exorbitant thirty million for it.

Now the prize had fallen into his lap.

"Sophia, I promise you this film will be perfected in every way."

Lucas tightened his grip on the script, his knuckles turning white.

This wasn't just his battle against Richard.

It was Sophia's reckoning with the Lowell family.

A faint smile curved Sophia's lips. "I believe in you."

After a hesitant pause, Lucas asked, "Will Mr. Croix attend the opening ceremony?"

"We'll see when the time comes."

"Thank you."

After leaving Pearl Entertainment, Lucas immediately announced on social media that "Empress" was Gavin Croix's latest work.

The internet exploded.

Oh my god! The legendary Gavin Croix is back!

I've watched "Lone Mountain" seven times—it makes me sob every viewing.

Wait, why would Gavin collaborate with Lucas Sheridan?

The comments section erupted instantly.

Gavin's "Lone Mountain" swept every major screenwriting award—it's the industry gold standard. He should be working with Director Lowell!

Since when do you get to decide who he works with?

Richard's fans went into meltdown, flooding Lowell Entertainment's official account demanding explanations.

When Richard received the news, his expression darkened immediately.

"William, what's the meaning of this?"

Back then, it was Sophia who had strongly recommended he film "Lone Mountain."

He'd barely glanced at the modest hundred-thousand-dollar copyright fee.

Who could have predicted that low-budget film would become a sensation?

Later, when he tried to recruit Gavin, the man became completely inaccessible.

Now after five years, Gavin suddenly resurfaces—and gives his script to Lucas?

William Lowell sneered. "Who else but Sophia could be behind this?"

Richard paced agitatedly around his office.

"Does she think marrying into the Valdemar family makes her untouchable? That they'll actually back her?"

William's eyes turned venomous. "A glorified nurse for a comatose husband, putting on airs."

Richard stopped abruptly.

"We can't let her get away with this. I need to speak with Patriarch Valdemar."
###Chapter 92

The twilight painted the sky in fiery hues, casting the entire city in golden-red light.

Sophia Laurent had just signed the cooperation agreement with Lucas Sheridan when she immediately dove back into handling company affairs.

Pearl Group had been under relentless pressure from Lowell Entertainment recently.

Lowell Entertainment was poaching partners by offering exorbitant prices without hesitation.

Oliver Granger swiftly adjusted strategies and restructured the supply chain.

Simultaneously, he discreetly reached out to Lowell Entertainment's business associates.

The corporate battle between these two giants had become the hottest topic in the industry.

After discussing countermeasures with Oliver, Sophia decided to personally reassure several key clients.

What surprised her more was former partners from Lowell Entertainment projects approaching her one after another.

Without hesitation, she redirected these resources to Pearl Group.

As she finished her last email, Patriarch Valdemar's call came through.

"Sophia, could you come to the sanatorium?"

Her fingers stilled over the keyboard.

"Of course, Grandfather. I'll be right there."

She closed her laptop, grabbed her coat, and headed out.

Patriarch Valdemar wouldn't call without good reason.

Whether it concerned Margaret Clementson or Alexander Valdemar, she had to go.

When Sophia pushed open the sanatorium doors, she never expected to see Richard Lowell there.

He was chatting amiably with Patriarch Valdemar, who maintained an inscrutable expression.

"Grandfather."

Sophia called softly.

The old man's stern features softened visibly upon seeing her.

"Come, sit here."

Richard noticed this subtle change, his brow furrowing almost imperceptibly.

Patriarch Valdemar's attitude toward Sophia seemed more favorable than he'd anticipated.

"Sophia," Richard forced a paternal smile, "aren't you going to greet your father?"

He was certain she wouldn't dare make a scene before Patriarch Valdemar.

After all, without the Lowell name, she'd be nothing in the Valdemar family.

Sophia gave him an icy glance.

"My apologies. I'm an orphan."

She would never acknowledge this man as her father.

Richard's smile froze.

He shot a panicked look at Patriarch Valdemar, only to find the old man completely unfazed, as if he'd known all along.

"Don't talk nonsense!" Richard hissed through gritted teeth.

If Sophia truly severed ties with the Lowells, all his schemes would collapse.

"My mind has never been clearer." Sophia met his gaze squarely. "The day I left the Lowell household marked the end of any connection between us."
###Chapter 93

Richard Lowell's blood pressure spiked when Sophia Laurent made those remarks in front of Patriarch Valdemar.

His knuckles turned white from clenching his fists too tightly.

"Have you lost your mind? How dare you spout such nonsense?"

His voice trembled with suppressed rage.

Sophia watched her father's furious expression with a mocking smile.

"Mr. Lowell, didn't you always teach me to assess situations carefully?"

She adjusted her cuffs leisurely.

"Now I finally understand. Some people were never meant to be family."

Richard's pupils constricted sharply.

Forgetting Patriarch Valdemar's presence, he snapped, "Do you really think you can survive in the Valdemar family without the Lowells' backing?"

"The position of Valdemar Group's CEO's wife isn't for the faint-hearted."

Sophia remained unfazed.

"It makes no difference who hears this."

She turned to Patriarch Valdemar with steady resolve.

"Grandfather, if this means canceling the engagement, I won't object."

A glimmer of approval flashed in the old man's eyes.

He gave a slight nod.

"Sophia, remember this—from the day you marry into our family, you'll be a Valdemar."

Richard paled.

"Patriarch Valdemar, surely you don't mean..."

The patriarch's gaze turned piercing.

"Mr. Lowell, must I spell everything out?"

He took a sip of tea.

"I heard Lowell Entertainment is competing with Pearl Group for projects recently?"

Beads of sweat formed on Richard's forehead.

"That's... just normal business competition..."

The teacup clicked sharply against the saucer.

"Sophia is now part of the Valdemar family."

"You'd do well to think twice before making any moves."

Richard's legs nearly gave way beneath him.

He couldn't comprehend how his neglected daughter had suddenly become the Valdemars' treasured jewel.

"What about... those cooperation agreements..."
###Chapter 94

Richard Lowell forced a smile. "Uncle, Sophia has always been stubborn. She didn't mean what she said earlier. Please don't take it seriously."

He truly believed this.

Sophia was just jealous of their favoritism toward Emily. This outburst was merely a cry for attention.

"The Lowell Group has been facing some difficulties recently. These projects are crucial for us..."

Richard deliberately trailed off.

If Patriarch Valdemar valued Sophia, he would surely offer assistance.

He anxiously studied the old man's expression.

With the Valdemar family's support, the Lowell Group could surpass Pearl Entertainment.

More importantly, it would send a clear message to the business world and deter potential partners of Pearl.

Instead, Patriarch Valdemar slid the documents toward Sophia. "Sophia, what do you think of these projects?"

Richard's pupils constricted.

He never expected Patriarch Valdemar to hold Sophia in such high regard.

She was just a minor composer who wrote a few songs. Why did she deserve his attention?

Sophia opened the file.

After scanning the contents, she frowned, then let out a cold laugh.

"Mr. Lowell, your calculations are so loud I could hear them from here."

These partners all had close ties to Valdemar Group.

Yet the Lowell Group's offers were far below market value—some even half of Pearl's bids.

Richard's face darkened. "Sophia, stop this nonsense!"

He lowered his voice in warning. "Don't forget you're still a shareholder of Lowell Group."

Sophia ignored him and addressed Patriarch Valdemar directly.

"The Jing Mountain project is priced at 65% of Pearl's bid. The semiconductor materials cost 30% more but offer identical quality..."

She succinctly pointed out every discrepancy.

"Sophia!" Richard barked.

"Am I wrong?" she countered coolly.

Faced with undeniable facts, Richard fell silent.

He stood frozen, blood rushing to his head, chest tight with fury.

"Appearances can be deceiving," he argued through gritted teeth. "The Lowell Group is an established enterprise with guaranteed quality—"

"Pearl's semiconductors meet all certifications. Their construction team has won municipal awards and complies with national standards," Sophia interrupted bluntly.

Richard stared at her in disbelief. "Have you become Pearl's lapdog? Forgotten your own family name?"

He immediately forced an apologetic smile toward Patriarch Valdemar.
###Chapter 95

"Uncle, I'm afraid I've made a fool of myself."

Richard Lowell heaved a deep sigh, his face etched with anguish.

"Sophia didn't grow up with us. We failed to discipline her properly. She can't distinguish right from wrong now, and because of our recent conflicts, she's deliberately causing trouble to spite Lowell Entertainment."

Patriarch Valdemar's expression remained impassive.

He turned to Sophia. "Sophia, who do you think deserves these partnerships?"

From an angle invisible to the old man, Richard shot Sophia a venomous glare.

His eyes clearly warned her - choose Pearl Group and face the consequences.

Sophia ignored him completely.

She straightened her posture. "Grandfather, based on professional evaluation, Pearl Group is the better choice."

Richard exploded with rage, raising his hand to strike her.

Sophia anticipated the move and stepped back swiftly.

He stumbled forward, nearly losing his balance.

Missing his target, Richard's eyes burned with fury as he glared at Sophia.

She met his gaze coldly, her expression unreadable.

Patriarch Valdemar let out a chilling laugh.

"It seems Mr. Lowell doesn't take my words seriously."

"Butler, escort him out. He's no longer welcome at Valdemar Manor."

Turning to Richard, he declared, "Effective immediately, Valdemar Holdings terminates all collaborations with Lowell Entertainment. Permanently."

Richard looked as if struck by lightning.

Only when security approached did he snap out of his daze.

"Uncle Valdemar, I was just disciplining my daughter. It shouldn't affect our families' relationship."

He never imagined Patriarch Valdemar would go this far for Sophia.

Now he deeply regretted his impulsiveness.

The old man remained unmoved.

"Sophia is a Valdemar now. How dare you raise your hand against her in my home?"

Richard was consumed by regret.

He'd come today intending to turn Patriarch Valdemar against Sophia while securing the deals.

These collaborations meant nothing to the Valdemars.

Yet Sophia had the audacity to interfere.

Clenching his teeth in hatred, Richard forced a smile.

"Sophia darling, Daddy just has a quick temper. I was only joking. You wouldn't take it seriously, would you?"
###Chapter 96

Sophia Laurent curled her lips in a mocking smile as she listened to Richard Lowell's hypocritical words.

"Mr. Lowell, your audacity truly knows no bounds."

His intentions were transparent - to cozy up to the Valdemar family while slandering her before Patriarch Valdemar.

Having failed, he'd resorted to physical intimidation in his fury.

Had Patriarch Valdemar not seen through his schemes, she would have been trapped in an impossible situation.

Any father with genuine concern for his daughter would never have acted so spitefully.

Richard's face darkened like storm clouds.

"Sophia! Look at yourself. Where's the poise befitting a lady of your standing?"

He couldn't comprehend how his once-devoted daughter had transformed into this stranger.

When Lowell Entertainment had teetered on bankruptcy, Sophia had single-handedly saved it.

"You rescued this company with your own hands. How can you watch it crumble now?"

Sophia met his gaze calmly.

"The business world is a battlefield. Wins and losses are inevitable. Even without Pearl Group, competitors would emerge."

These were open bidding projects. Where was the deliberate targeting?

"Don't forget you still hold shares in Lowell Entertainment."

A cold glint flashed in Sophia's eyes. "So what?"

Her dedication to the company had evaporated with their betrayals.

Richard flinched under her icy stare.

For the first time, he truly grasped Sophia's complete disillusionment with the Lowell family.

Deathly silence filled the hospital room.

Patriarch Valdemar finally broke the tension.

"That's enough. Show our guest out."

His authoritative gaze pinned Richard. "Don't bother visiting again without good reason."

Richard scrambled to salvage the situation. "Uncle Valdemar, my apologies for today's impropriety. I'll make amends another time."

He slunk from the room, shooting Sophia a venomous glare as he left.

She didn't even grant him a backward glance.

Outside the sanatorium, William Lowell rushed to meet his father. "How did it go?"

Richard collapsed into their car, ashen-faced.

"Everything's ruined..."

William's expression twisted. "What did Sophia do this time? How could Patriarch Valdemar believe her?"

"The old man favors her. We miscalculated."

"What about the partnership?"

"Pearl Group snatched it."

Richard ground his teeth. "We need an emergency meeting."

"What?!"

William slammed the steering wheel. "How could this happen?"
###Chapter 97

The Valdemar Group's recent collaborations were mere drops in the bucket for the industry.

Yet insiders understood these lucrative deals always prioritized family connections.

The Lowells, as the Valdemars' in-laws, should have been the natural choice.

But Patriarch Valdemar had shockingly awarded the contracts to their rival, Pearl Group.

"That wretched Sophia is behind this!" Richard Lowell's fingers dug into the leather armrest.

His chest tightened recalling the cold reception at Valdemar Holdings.

"Choosing outsiders over family? The old man's lost his mind!"

William Lowell's gaze darkened as he stared out the window.

The projects themselves meant little.

But the industry would interpret this as the Valdemars snubbing the Lowells.

That was the real disaster.

Richard slumped back with a heavy sigh.

"If only Emily had married into their family..."

His youngest daughter knew how to charm elders, unlike that ungrateful Sophia.

"Who knew the old man would dote on a therapeutic bride?" William massaged his temples.

He'd never have let his sister marry a comatose man.

Not even the former Valdemar heir.

"Don't worry, Father." His voice turned icy. "The patriarch won't last much longer."

Since Alexander's accident, undercurrents had rippled through Valdemar Holdings.

The once-formidable patriarch was now a spent force.

Shareholders circled like vultures.

"Our priority is cultivating Vincent Valdemar."

Richard nodded grimly.

"Given the circumstances, the Valdemar succession—"

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

The Lowell mansion was in chaos when they arrived.

Victoria sat shell-shocked on the sofa.

Nathan drowned himself in liquor.

"What happened?" Richard barked.

Victoria's voice trembled. "Nathan's endorsements... all canceled."

"Mass fan exodus. PR can't contain it."

Richard's face drained of color.

Nathan was Lowell Entertainment's cash cow.

His downfall would tank their entire entertainment division.

William quietly explained the situation.

With a crash, Richard overturned the coffee table.

"Sophia again!"

Veins bulged at his temples, eyes burning with hatred.

"That bastard child dares oppose us?"
###Chapter 98

Nathan Lowell's fingers hovered above the piano keys, frozen mid-air.

He remembered Sophia Laurent's effortless grace when she played at the concert hall.

"Self-taught, yet more talented than conservatory graduates..."

The thought tightened his chest.

The piano lid reflected his haggard face.

Once a celebrated musical prodigy, he now couldn't even book small recitals.

His agent's morning text confirmed his last endorsement deal had fallen through.

Penalty fees kept snowballing.

All because of that livestream.

Sophia's casual remarks had shattered his carefully crafted public image.

"If only..."

Richard Lowell slammed his teacup onto the coffee table.

"Writing a few melodies doesn't make you special."

His lips curled. "Just a puppet dancing for corporate sponsors."

William Lowell scrolled through financial news on his tablet, brows furrowing.

"Pearl Group just secured two international contracts."

He swiped angrily. "That old fox Oliver Granger won't budge an inch."

Silence filled the study.

Only the wall clock's ticking sounded unnaturally loud.

Richard suddenly stood.

"Find out who really controls Pearl Group."

His eyes narrowed. "No one turns down money."

William nodded in understanding.

"Sophia thinks the Valdemars will protect her forever."

He lowered his voice. "Let's show them her true colors."

Victoria Lowell's hands trembled around the fruit tray.

"Must we go this far?"

Her voice shook. "Blood is thicker than water..."

"Mother!"

William slammed the table.

"Did she consider family ties when suing you?"

He pointed at Nathan. "Or when she ruined our brother's reputation?"

Nathan stared at his reflection in the polished keys.

For a moment, he saw little Sophia standing on tiptoes, reaching for his piano.

He'd pushed her away then.

Now he caught himself wishing—

If Sophia lost everything, would she return to that lonely girl craving affection?

Richard traced the family portrait on his desk.

Sophia wasn't in the frame.

"She'll learn who her real family is when she hits rock bottom."

His cold eyes gleamed in the glass reflection.
###Chapter 99

Victoria Lowell remained silent for a long moment before finally relenting.

She sighed softly. "The trial is about to begin. Lend me some money, or mortgage the property to Sophia."

William Lowell frowned deeply. "Mother, did you beg her?"

"I did." Victoria's expression was complicated. "But she was adamant. She won't drop the lawsuit."

She couldn't understand why Sophia had become so heartless.

They were all children she'd raised with her own hands. Why was Sophia making such a fuss?

Richard Lowell snorted coldly. "Then let her sue! I'd like to see if she dares to make her own mother repay the money."

Victoria froze.

Was he expecting her to appear in court herself?

How could she face such humiliation?

For the first time, she saw clearly.

None of the husband and children she'd doted on were willing to help.

They were directors, CEOs, celebrities, designers—yet all pretended to be penniless.

Victoria suddenly missed the days when she could freely use Sophia's credit cards.

Now she finally understood who truly cared for her.

"You want me to be humiliated in court? How could I face society after this?"

William stayed silent.

Nathan Lowell frowned. "Mother, I've been paying hefty breach fees recently. I'm broke."

He also wanted to see if Sophia would follow through.

Richard sneered. "Relax, she won't dare. The Valdemars won't be pleased if this gets out."

Victoria's heart turned to ice.

Her husband wanted her humiliated. Her children all claimed poverty.

The most laughable was Emily Lowell.

With one phone call, she'd turned her sons against her.

How had she never noticed this adopted daughter's cunning before?

Victoria turned and left.

She decided to sell her jewelry and raise the money herself.

At the sanatorium, Sophia apologized to Patriarch Valdemar.

"Grandfather, I'm sorry for disturbing your rest."

The old man waved his hand. "We're family. No need for formalities."

Alexander had been conscious for increasingly longer periods.

What would happen when he fully woke up?
###Chapter 100

Oliver Granger sat beaming in his office at Pearl Entertainment. He leisurely dialed William Lowell's number.

"Mr. Lowell, didn't you claim the Valdemar project belonged exclusively to Lowell Entertainment?" Oliver deliberately drew out his words. "How curious that the contract now rests in Pearl's hands."

A sharp crack echoed through the phone as William smashed his device.

"Father, you assured me you could contact Pearl's major shareholder," William said through gritted teeth. "I won't tolerate Sophia Laurent and Oliver's gloating any longer."

Richard Lowell nodded grimly. "I'll reach out to your Uncle Leonard immediately."

Meanwhile, Sophia remained engrossed in paperwork at Pearl's headquarters.

Since news broke of Valdemar Group choosing Pearl as their partner, collaboration proposals had flooded in like snowflakes.

She'd been so swamped that she'd even declined Lucas Sheridan's invitation for "Empress" promotional events.

The film's posters now dominated theater lobbies nationwide.

The screenwriting credit for "Gavin Croix" stood out prominently. The acclaimed writer of "Lone Mountain" had reemerged after years of absence.

Online chatter buzzed relentlessly.

"Gavin Croix collaborating with Lucas Sheridan?"

"Without Director Lowell's involvement, can he still deliver?"

"Has his creative well run dry?"

Sophia ignored the noise completely, focused on reviewing quarterly reports.

Pearl's performance had soared since her return.

A gentle knock interrupted her concentration.

She looked up and immediately rose. "Uncle Leonard?"

Leonard Roland entered with a warm smile. "I heard you'd returned to the company and wanted to see you."

His gaze held paternal affection as he studied her. "How have you been?"

"Everything's progressing well, thanks to you." Sophia signaled her secretary to prepare tea.

Leonard settled onto the sofa and sipped the delicate brew.

"I heard... you've severed ties with the Lowells?"

Sophia remained composed. "The paperwork is complete."

Leonard gave a knowing nod.

As an old friend of the Lowell patriarch, he understood Sophia's position better than anyone.

"There's something you should know." Leonard set down his cup. "Your father asked me to introduce him to Pearl's silent partner."

Sophia's fingers stilled momentarily.

She needed no explanation to decipher Richard's intentions.
###Chapter 101

Richard Lowell plotted to target Pearl Entertainment to get at Sophia Laurent.
He naively believed cutting off her corporate backing would make her compliant.

A cold glint flashed in Sophia's eyes as she imagined the coming confrontation.
Her lips curved slightly. "Thank you for arranging the introduction, Uncle Leonard."
She couldn't wait to see Richard and William's expressions when they met.

Leonard Roland ended the call with a knowing smile.
"Seven tonight at Villa Tuscany."
He glanced at Sophia. "I'll sit this one out. Enjoy your reunion."

Sophia understood perfectly. Leonard was giving her a chance to settle scores.
The entire business circle had witnessed how the Lowells treated her.

That afternoon, Sophia attended a business gala with Oliver Granger.
They immediately encountered Richard and William Lowell upon arrival.

William maintained an uncharacteristic composure.
He lifted his chin disdainfully. "Sophia."

She didn't turn. "Yes?"

"Too important to acknowledge us now that you've got Pearl Entertainment's backing?" William sneered.

Sophia laughed brightly. "Exactly. What can you do about it?"

William's face darkened.
"You're just an employee. Don't overestimate yourself." His gaze slid to Oliver. "Or is there something...unprofessional between you two?"

Oliver flushed with anger. "Watch your mouth, William!"

Seeing Oliver's reaction, William smirked victoriously.
"Hit a nerve?"

CRACK!
A sharp slap silenced William mid-sentence.
Sophia lowered her hand, eyes icy.
###Chapter 102

Sophia's palm connected sharply with William's cheek.

The crisp sound silenced the entire private room.

William's face burned. He pressed a hand to his stinging skin, disbelief in his eyes.

"Have you lost your mind?"

He shot to his feet, fists clenched.

Oliver swiftly stepped between them.

"Mr. Lowell, please calm down."

William's knuckles turned white.

"Sophia, do you realize what you've done?"

His voice was a venomous hiss.

Sophia met his glare with icy composure.

"Perfectly."

Her gaze could freeze hell itself.

"That was for me."

Among the four Lowell brothers, Christopher and Nathan had been openly cruel.

William and Daniel had at least maintained surface civility.

Now she saw through their act.

Their pretended concern had always been just that—an act.

William suddenly smirked.

"Did I strike a nerve?"

He tilted his chin in challenge.

"Mr. Granger seems awfully protective of you. Something going on between you two?"

Sophia dug her nails into her palms.

"Not everyone shares the Lowell family's depravity."

She'd witnessed enough of Emily's inappropriate closeness with the brothers.

William shrugged.

"If it's not that kind of relationship, why would he defend you?"

He leisurely poured himself a drink.

"Did Ethan Winston dump you after discovering something?"

Sophia's eyes turned glacial.

"Say that again."

William swirled his glass, smug.

"What if I do?"

He took a sip.

"Don't forget—you're just employees."

"Do you think Pearl Entertainment's real owner would tolerate such insolence?"

Oliver's expression turned peculiar.

He shot Sophia a sideways glance.

Sophia suddenly smiled.

"You're absolutely right."

She stepped closer to William.

"I should consider my position."

Mistaking her retreat for fear, William's smirk widened.

"Smart girl."

He adjusted his tie.

"I'm meeting Pearl's owner tonight."

"Apologize now, and I might forget this incident."

Oliver coughed discreetly.

Sophia's lips curved.

"Is that so?"

Her tone held dark amusement.

"What a... remarkable coincidence."
###Chapter 103

Sophia Laurent's lips curved into an amused smile at his threat.

Richard Lowell stepped forward to mediate at just the right moment.

A benevolent smile graced his face as he spoke in a gentle tone. "Sophia, blood is thicker than water. Why let things escalate like this?"

At this moment, Richard resembled nothing more than a doting father offering sage advice.

"If you're willing to admit your mistakes, not only will we reinstate your position, but you'll also take the helm at Lowell Entertainment. Doesn't that sound fair?"

Since Sophia's departure, chaos had engulfed the Lowell Group, erasing all traces of its former order.

Her identity as Composer T was nothing short of a goldmine for Lowell Entertainment.

William Lowell seethed with resentment, yet he couldn't deny his desire for her return.

His gaze remained fixed on Sophia, scrutinizing every subtle shift in her expression.

Sophia burst into laughter upon hearing his proposal.

"Are you seriously daydreaming in broad daylight?" She arched an eyebrow. "Should I call an ambulance for you?"

Richard's expression darkened.

"Sophia, don't be ungrateful. Tonight, the founder of Pearl Group is dining with us."

"Do you really think he'll protect you the way Oliver did?"

Sophia casually adjusted her cuff.

"Instead of scheming, you'd be better off focusing on running the company properly."

Though William's capabilities were limited, the foundation she had built would sustain them for a while.

Her words were meant as sincere advice.

To William, however, they dripped with mockery.

His face turned ashen. "Sophia, those who live by the sword die by the sword."

Sophia chuckled. "I'll return those exact words to you."

With that, she turned to leave. "Oliver, let's go."

Richard watched her retreating figure, his brow furrowed.

Her reaction was far too composed.

Did she truly have something up her sleeve?

Sophia led Oliver away to greet the event organizers.

Oliver hesitated before finally speaking up.

"They invited you?"

Sophia nodded.

Oliver suddenly laughed. "Take me with you tonight."

"I can't wait to see their faces."

Sophia shrugged indifferently. "Suit yourself."

Just then, a tall figure approached.

Ethan Winston stood before them in a crisp black suit. "Sophia, may I have a word?"
###Chapter 104

Ethan Winston's entrance commanded the ballroom's attention.

His tailored black suit accentuated the aristocratic bearing of a scion from old money.

Those obsidian-dark eyes locked onto Sophia Laurent, softening with intoxicating tenderness.

"Sophia, three years together must count for something. Can't we talk?"

She turned away without expression.

"We've said all there is to say."

The smoke-gray backless gown clung to her figure. Ebony hair swept up revealed delicate strands framing her face.

Her phoenix eyes glittered like stars, the slight press of lips lending a cutting beauty.

The Sophia who once orbited around him had been lovely, but lacked this magnetic presence.

Now she resembled a polished diamond - every facet dazzling with brilliance.

"Just let me explain." Ethan softened his tone. "About what happened on your birthday..."

Sophia studied the face that once haunted her dreams and felt nothing.

How had she never noticed how poorly he acted?

"Fine. Outside."

Hope flashed in Ethan's eyes as he followed her retreating figure.

Their departure sparked whispers across the room.

In the shadows, William Lowell examined freshly captured photos, lips curling coldly.

The images showed Ethan's adoring gaze and Sophia's faint smile.

Perfect "rekindled romance" evidence.

He'd intended to smear Sophia as a desperate ex.

Instead, he'd captured proof of marital infidelity.

Patriarch Valdemar would erupt.

William swiftly forwarded the photos to a media contact before slipping out unnoticed.

At the corridor's end, Sophia crossed her arms.

"Speak."

"The engagement with Isabella was arranged. My feelings for her died long ago."

"Poor memory, Mr. Winston." Sophia's laugh held ice. "You used that exact line last time. Expecting me to play mistress now?"

Ethan stepped closer. "I was a fool then. You're the only one I—"

Sophia regarded his anxious expression with detached amusement.

The betrayal that once shattered her now seemed laughable.

Each encounter revealed more of this man's true nature.
###Chapter 105

Sophia's gaze was icy. "Ethan Winston, your affection isn't even worth scrap paper."

In the past, those words would have thrilled her.

But a heart that's died once can't be stirred again.

She closed her eyes briefly. The image of young Ethan charging into a burning building to save her flashed through her mind.

"If you chose Isabella Evans, stop wavering."

She knew the Winston family situation all too well.

The Winston patriarch was a notorious womanizer with illegitimate children scattered across the country.

Each child was groomed as a potential heir. Only the victor would control Winston Holdings.

Marrying into the Evans family was Ethan's key move in the inheritance battle.

Ethan's chest tightened at Sophia's detached expression. "Sophia..."

He clenched his fists. "Once I secure Winston Holdings, I'll give you the grandest wedding."

Sophia blinked.

Then she laughed abruptly. "You think this is a joke?"

Ethan's pulse spiked at her laughter. "What do you mean?"

"Everything I said last time was true."

Sophia met his eyes squarely. "I'm already married."

She turned to leave without another word.

He should have anticipated this outcome when he humiliated her publicly.

As for his life-saving act years ago? Three years of devotion had repaid that debt in full.

Ethan grabbed her wrist.

"Stop this nonsense. Marriage isn't something to decide out of spite—"

Sophia wrenched free with visible disgust.

"Don't touch me."

She stepped back, eyes sharp as daggers. "Lay another finger on me, and I'll report you for sexual harassment."

With that, she walked away without looking back.

Ethan stood frozen, face darkening.

The girl who once adored him now threatened to call the police?

His molars ground together.

He needed to seize control of Winston Holdings immediately.

Once he claimed that throne, Sophia would come crawling back.

Sophia strode toward the ballroom, expression grim.

At the corridor's turn, William Lowell leaned against the wall with a mocking smirk.

"Tsk tsk. Sneaking off with an ex at a gala? How enterprising of you, Mrs. Valdemar."

Sophia's pupils contracted. "You followed me?"

"Truth has a way of surfacing," William twirled his wineglass smugly.

"Do you really think the Valdemars would tolerate a promiscuous daughter-in-law?"
###Chapter 106

Sophia Laurent arched an eyebrow at William Lowell's smug expression, her lips curling into a mocking smile.

"When did I say I'd hide this from the Valdemars?"

William stiffened at her unexpected retort, his brows knitting together.

"William." She tapped the corridor to her right. "The restroom mirror is polished enough for you to see your own hypocrisy."

The man's artificial smile froze.

"Without Pearl Group backing you," he slammed the table as he stood, "what makes you think you're anything? As family, I'll give you one last warning—"

"Are you so certain," Sophia interrupted smoothly, "the founder would choose you over me?"

William snorted through his nose. "Business runs on profit. I'll bankrupt myself if I must to make you beg."

He'd never forget the slap she'd delivered in public.

"Fine." Sophia adjusted her skirt as she rose. "I'll be waiting."

The chandelier's fractured light danced behind her like scattered stars.

Dusk draped Villa Tuscany's arched rooftops as the black Maybach sped toward the suburbs. Sophia trailed her fingers along the carved wooden windows, catching fractured sunbeams.

"Braised sturgeon requires slow simmering." She closed the gilded menu. "Serve the other dishes when ready."

The waiter stole a glance at the lone diner—she stirred dragon well tea in a celadon cup as if awaiting a spectacle.

The door burst open just as sweet-and-sour ribs' aroma reached Richard Lowell's nostrils.

"You—!"

William's roar startled koi fish outside the window.

Richard's shaking fingers dialed a number. "Leonard Roland! I demanded to meet Pearl Group's—"

"Met her?" Leonard's chuckle crackled through the line.

"This is a joke?" Richard glared at Sophia picking crab meat, jaw clenched. "How could this girl possibly—"

Leonard's voice struck like a slap:

"Why couldn't she be?"
###Chapter 107
Richard's Shock

Richard's pupils constricted violently. His phone nearly slipped from his grasp.

He stood frozen, his breath catching for several seconds.

"Leonard, this... this isn't some kind of joke, is it?" His voice trembled unmistakably.

Leonard's resolute reply came through the phone: "Would I joke about something like this?"

The phone slowly lowered from Richard's hand. His gaze toward Sophia shifted completely.

William noticed his father's strange demeanor and asked urgently, "Dad, what did Uncle Leonard say?"

Richard snapped back to reality.

He stared at Sophia, his voice hoarse. "Pearl Group... is yours?"

"What a joke!" William scoffed. "How could she possibly—"

"Silence!" Richard cut him off sharply.

Sophia set down her fork gracefully and dabbed her lips with a napkin.

"It is," she said calmly, her expression unreadable.

Richard staggered back two steps, bracing himself against the dining table to steady himself.

William's face turned deathly pale.

"You're lying!" he shrieked hysterically. "How old were you when Pearl Group was founded?"

Oliver burst into laughter beside them.

"Master William, just because you're incompetent doesn't mean everyone else is."

William was about to lash out when his father yanked him back.

"Your Uncle Leonard confirmed it himself," Richard said, his voice rasping. "Sophia is indeed the founder of Pearl Group."

The words hit William like a sledgehammer, leaving him dizzy.

He gaped at Sophia, his lips trembling soundlessly.

Every taunt and threat he'd ever thrown at her now seemed like the most pathetic joke.

Richard opened his mouth, then closed it, his expression unbearably complex.

Sophia couldn't even be bothered to glance their way.

She focused on savoring the meal before her, every movement poised and deliberate.

Since deciding to keep the baby, she'd felt an unexpected lightness.

This child would become her most precious family in this world.
###Chapter 108

Sophia circled the date of her prenatal checkup in red on the calendar.

Richard and William Lowell stood by the dining table, their expressions shifting as they watched Sophia eat.

The revelation that she was the founder of Pearl Group hit them like a sledgehammer.

No wonder.

No wonder Pearl Group had always protected Sophia.

The entire business empire belonged to her.

Richard's mind reeled.

He never imagined his daughter could achieve such success.

Nor did he expect this success to become an unbridgeable chasm between them.

If only...

If only he hadn't forced her into marriage, Pearl Group might have merged with Lowell Entertainment long ago.

The thought made his skin crawl with regret.

"Sophia," Richard finally broke the silence. "Forcing you to marry into the Valdemar family was my mistake. If you truly refuse, I'll speak to Patriarch Valdemar. Emily can take your place."

William opened his mouth but remained silent.

That vegetative Valdemar heir would suit Emily perfectly.

At least his sister would work for the Lowell family's benefit.

Unlike this cold-hearted woman before them.

Sophia set down her chopsticks and dabbed her lips.

"No need." A faint smile touched her lips. "Alexander suits me just fine."

A comatose husband required little effort.

Once he woke, divorce would be simple.

She wanted nothing from the Valdemars anyway.

Richard frowned. "I thought you loved that Winston boy?"

"You assumed wrong." Sophia stood to retrieve her bag.

Richard hurried to block her path. "What will it take for you to forgive us?"

His tone softened. "You've taken your shares. Why must we remain estranged?"

Sophia paused, chuckling lightly.

"Forget it." She shook her head. "You'll never understand."

Her concerns had never been about whom she married.
###Chapter 109

"You refuse to speak. How are we supposed to know what you're thinking?" William Lowell's furious voice echoed through the private room. "What will it take for you to stop this?"

Sophia Laurent lifted her lashes, casting him an indifferent glance.

"To earn my forgiveness, you'd do anything?"

Richard Lowell avoided her gaze, remaining silent.

But William straightened his posture. "This isn't about begging for forgiveness. We just want to avoid unnecessary drama."

"Fine." Sophia settled back into her chair. "When I first returned to the Lowell family, Emily framed me for ruining her dress. You forced me to apologize. When I refused, you locked me in my room without food for two days."

William's face darkened. "Emily grew up under our care. She would never—"

"Of course. She's pure and kind." Sophia's lips curved into a cold smile. "I'm the wild child with a vicious heart, incapable of goodness."

Her fingers traced the rim of her water glass.

"Now I'm exactly that malicious person who wants to see you suffer. What will you do about it?"

"You—" William trembled with rage. "Don't push your luck."

"I already am." Sophia tilted her chin up. "What can you possibly do?"

Sunlight streamed through the window, gilding her silhouette.

William faltered, momentarily stunned.

"Pearl Entertainment may be impressive, but it's no match for Lowell's decades of foundation." He lowered his voice. "If you're smart, you'll make the right choice."

Richard nodded. "If it matters to you, I can make Emily apologize. Let bygones be bygones."

"Spare me." Sophia stood. "The thought disgusts me."

She walked toward the exit without looking back.

"Sophia!" William roared. "You think you're untouchable? Investing in 'Empress' to compete with Dad's project? You're digging your own grave!"

Lowell Entertainment's "River Banquet" was a high-budget historical drama.

The audacity of Sophia producing a similar period piece with Lucas Sheridan was laughable.

Richard sighed. "Lucas isn't a professional director. 'Empress' is scheduled against our release. Sophia, cut your losses now."

So what if Gavin Croix wrote the script?

"Lone Mountain's" success was pure luck.

Sophia nearly laughed aloud.

She turned, her gaze sweeping over their faces.

"You two..." She exhaled softly. "Are adorably confident."

Richard detested that tone.

"'River Banquet' stars Christopher and Emily. The box office will crush your project." His voice turned stern. "Stop being stubborn..."
###Chapter 110

Sophia Laurent's lips curved slightly, her eyes flashing with derision.

She had read the script for "River Banquet" long ago. When Pearl Group first approached Quentin Shaw, she had explicitly opposed acquiring the rights.

Unfortunately, Richard Lowell insisted on having his way.

Add to that Christopher Lowell and Emily Lowell starring in it...

She had nothing left to say.

"Do as you please." Sophia's voice was icy. "Investing in films is for corporate profits. Don't flatter yourselves."

Richard's face darkened. "Those who won't listen will suffer!"

Sophia refused to waste another breath. She turned and left with Oliver Granger in tow.

The moment the private room door closed, William Lowell slammed his fist onto the table, knuckles whitening.

He glared at the exit, fury blazing in his eyes.

Richard, however, narrowed his gaze, calculation flickering behind his shrewd expression.

Morning sunlight streamed into the Westmount Villa bedroom.

Sophia awoke to the scent of roses drifting through the window.

The housekeeper had breakfast ready. "Madam, your meal is prepared."

"Thank you." Sophia smiled slightly.

Such consideration never existed in the Lowell household.

No one waited for her at mealtimes. No one cared if she went hungry.

Since leaving, life had become simpler.

No more exhausting efforts for Lowell Entertainment.

No cleaning up William's messes.

No managing Christopher's acting career.

She could finally breathe.

After breakfast, Sophia drove alone to the hospital.

Today was her prenatal appointment.

The doctor's warning still echoed in her ears: Miscarrying could mean never becoming a mother.

The greater danger was life-threatening hemorrhage.

So she decided to keep the baby.

This child was hers alone.

"The embryo is developing well. We'll hear the heartbeat in a few weeks." The doctor reviewed the chart. "Any discomfort during early pregnancy?"

Sophia considered. "Just frequent hunger."

"Perfectly normal." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Seek immediate care for severe vomiting or bleeding."

After receiving folic acid and vitamins, Sophia thanked him and left.

Lost in thought, she rounded a corner—and collided with someone.

"Sophia?"

A shrill voice rang out.

Sophia looked up into Gabrielle Winston's hostile gaze.

"What are you doing here?" Gabrielle's contemptuous eyes raked over her.
###Chapter 111

"None of your business."

Sophia Laurent's icy gaze swept over Gabrielle Winston's perfectly made-up face. The younger Winston sister had always been hostile toward her, finding every opportunity to make trouble.

Before, Sophia would tolerate it out of respect for Ethan. But her patience only seemed to fuel Gabrielle's arrogance.

Gabrielle let out a mocking laugh.

"What's with the attitude, Sophia? Don't want to marry into the Winston family anymore?" She deliberately drew out her words. "Oh right, my brother is engaged to Isabella next month. You should come to the wedding..."

Her eyes gleamed as she watched Sophia's face, waiting for the expected devastation.

"Pass."

Sophia cut her off cleanly. "Ethan and Isabella mean nothing to me. Why would I care about their engagement?"

Gabrielle's smirk faltered when she didn't get the reaction she wanted.

"Who are you trying to fool?" She fiddled with her manicured nails. "Everyone knows you've been obsessed with my brother for three years. Pathetic."

Her gaze suddenly dropped to Sophia's abdomen.

"Wait... You just came from the OB-GYN..." Gabrielle's voice sharpened. "Are you trying to trap him with a baby?"

Sophia nearly laughed at the absurdity.

"Gabrielle, your imagination is wild." A cold smile touched her lips. "Your brother is ancient history. Everyone makes mistakes when they're young."

Gabrielle gaped, stunned by this version of Sophia who once worshipped Ethan.

"Stay away from him!"

"Right back at you." Sophia's tone remained calm. "Tell Ethan to avoid me. I don't want to see him again."

Gabrielle blinked, then sneered.

Her eyes lingered pointedly on Sophia's stomach. "Good. If you're carrying some bastard, get rid of it. Don't think you can pawn it off on our family."

Before she could finish, a sharp slap cracked across her cheek.

Slap!

The sound turned heads nearby.

"Watch your mouth." Sophia's eyes flashed dangerously. "Next time, I won't be so polite."

Gabrielle clutched her stinging face, stunned.

"You—you hit me?" Her voice trembled. "I'm telling Ethan!"

Sophia smirked. "Go ahead. Let's see what he can do."

Gabrielle had never seen this side of Sophia. For once, she was speechless.

But she wouldn't let this go.

With shaking hands, she pulled out her phone and dialed Ethan.

"Ethan! Sophia just slapped me! She—she attacked me!"
###Chapter 112

Sophia Laurent's lips curled into a mocking smile as she heard the voice on the phone.

She couldn't be bothered to entertain Gabrielle Winston's provocation and turned to leave.

"Stop!" Gabrielle rushed forward and grabbed her wrist.

"Did I say you could go?"

A flash of malice crossed Gabrielle's eyes as she suddenly raised her hand to strike Sophia's face.

"What good is that face of yours besides seducing men?"

Sophia had anticipated this.

She sidestepped gracefully, and Gabrielle's nails barely grazed her hair.

"Ah!"

Wearing ten-centimeter heels, Gabrielle stumbled and fell hard onto the floor.

"Sophia! How dare you push me?" she shrieked immediately.

Sophia rubbed her temples.

"Gabrielle, after all these years, you still haven't grown up."

She remembered how Gabrielle had always framed her like this in the past.

Ethan Winston would always tell her to endure it, claiming his sister was young and immature.

A twenty-two-year-old pretending to be naive?

Looking back now, Ethan's reprimands were probably just for show.

Otherwise, why would Gabrielle take them seriously?

In Gabrielle's eyes, Sophia was nothing but a gold-digger clinging to power.

When had she ever seen Sophia this assertive?

Gabrielle froze for a moment.

Seeing Sophia about to leave, she quickly pulled out her phone.

"Ethan! Sophia hit me! She even pushed me! My hands are all scraped!"

She deliberately raised her voice.

"Oh, and I ran into her at the OB-GYN. Maybe she's pregnant and trying to trap you?"

"Don't fall for it, Ethan! Isabella is the only one I'll accept as my sister-in-law!"

Sophia paused mid-step.

She didn't care about the slander.

But if Ethan found out about the pregnancy, it could spell trouble.

The thought only made her more irritable.

After leaving the hospital, Sophia headed straight to the office.

As soon as she entered Pearl Group's headquarters, she heard a commotion.

"You need an appointment to see Sophia? Who does she think she is?"

A man in sunglasses was causing a scene at the reception desk.

"Sorry, sir. You can't see Ms. Laurent without an appointment," the receptionist replied politely.

The man scoffed.

"Ms. Laurent? Tell her to get out here!"

"Too scared to face me? Hiding like a coward?"

"Sophia, do you really think you're untouchable now?"
###Chapter 1

The receptionist's professional smile faded as she watched the man's arrogant demeanor.

"Sir, please mind your manners."

He scoffed, his face twisting with disdain.

"This is who I am. What can you possibly do about it?"

His contemptuous gaze swept over her. "Stay out of this. I'm here for Sophia Laurent..."

Sophia recognized that voice immediately.

It was Christopher Lowell, her third brother who'd made it big in the entertainment industry.

She approached with an impassive expression.

"Christopher, did dogs eat your manners?"

Her icy stare took in his slouching posture. "All you do is bark."

Christopher turned to face her.

The girl's clear eyes showed no trace of fear.

His anger morphed into bitter laughter.

"Look who's grown a backbone. Now you dare insult me?"

His tone turned snarky. "Impressive, Sophia."

Not only had she targeted Emily Lowell at every turn, now she dared challenge them directly?

"I heard you dethroned Nathan, stole William's project, and even sued Mother?"

"Why don't you just shoot for the moon while you're at it?"

Sophia remained unruffled.

"My affairs are none of your concern."

She looked at him like he was a joke. "I do as I please."

Christopher's brow furrowed.

"Emily said you'd changed. I didn't believe her."

Sophia's voice turned glacial.

"If you're done, get out. Pearl Group doesn't entertain rabid dogs."

He let out a cold laugh. "Who do you think you are, Sophia?"

Grabbing items from the reception desk, he hurled them to the ground.

The sound of shattering glass filled the air.

"You gutter-born bastard, how dare you speak to me like this?"

"Think you're somebody now?"

"I only tolerated you before out of respect for the Lowell name. But since you're courting death..."

"Pearl Group, huh? I'll come make trouble every day. Let's see how long you last..."

Sophia watched his tantrum calmly.

She'd been the one who propelled Christopher to stardom.

The "wealthy heir pursuing showbiz dreams" persona, coupled with carefully selected scripts, had won him countless fans.

Blind adoration made him increasingly reckless.

After all, Lowell Entertainment's PR team and obsessive fans always cleaned up his messes.

Sophia's gaze made him uneasy.

"What? Got a problem with me?"

"No."

She shook her head slightly. "I just didn't expect fame would cost you your brains too."
###Chapter 114

Christopher Lowell's face darkened instantly. "Sophia Laurent, how dare you speak to me like that?"

Sophia gazed at the arrogant young man before her, a flicker of heartache flashing in her eyes.

Her once humble and polite younger brother had been completely transformed by the vanity of the entertainment industry.

With the Lowell family's backing, striking looks, and several hit dramas under his belt, Christopher had skyrocketed to fame as a top-tier celebrity.

The sudden influx of wealth and recognition had gradually led him astray.

Now he looked down on everyone, acting as if the world revolved around him.

Sophia's lips curved into a meaningful smile.

"Not only will I reprimand you, but I'll also make you pay for what you've done today."

Christopher burst into exaggerated laughter as if hearing the most ridiculous joke.

"Hahaha, am I hearing this right?"

"You? Sophia Laurent? What could you possibly do to me?"

He arrogantly grabbed a teacup from the table and smashed it on the floor right in front of her.

The sharp sound of shattering porcelain echoed through the office.

"Go ahead. Let's see how you'll—"

Sophia calmly instructed the receptionist, "Call the police. Someone is intentionally damaging company property."

Then she ordered the approaching security guards, "Block all exits. Don't let anyone leave."

Christopher always traveled with an entourage—assistants, makeup artists, and four bodyguards.

This was why he dared to act so recklessly.

With wealth, influence, millions of fans, and bodyguards by his side, he believed he could buy his way out of any trouble.

Over time, he grew increasingly insolent.

The bodyguards immediately formed a protective circle around Christopher, facing off against the security team.

"Sophia Laurent, have you lost your mind?"

Christopher doubled over with laughter. "You're calling the police over a few cheap cups?"

He gave Sophia a disdainful once-over.

"What can the police even do?"

"You might end up worse off than you started..."

Sophia ignored his taunts.

Pearl Group's security team was well-trained, swiftly blocking all possible exits.

Ten minutes later, police sirens grew louder.

"Who reported the incident?"

Sophia pointed at Christopher. "Officer, this man intentionally destroyed company property."

The scene was chaotic—shattered vases, teacups, and scattered documents littered the floor.

The officer turned to Christopher. "Did you cause this damage?"

Christopher shoved his hands in his pockets, sneering. His assistant smoothly stepped forward to mediate.

"Officer, this is just a misunderstanding. We're willing to compensate for the damages."

The officer looked at Sophia. "They've offered compensation. Would you—"

Sophia shook her head. "I refuse compensation. He acted deliberately and has broken the law."

She cast a cold glance at Christopher.

"According to public security regulations, intentional destruction of property warrants legal consequences."

The officer nodded in understanding and approached Christopher.

"Sir, please come with us."

"What?" Christopher's face paled. "Do you know who I am?"

"The law applies equally to everyone."
###Chapter 115

The officer's expression was stern. "Please cooperate with the investigation."

Christopher Lowell smirked arrogantly. "What's the hurry?"

He pulled a check from his briefcase and flung it toward Sophia Laurent.

"How much could these worthless things cost? Here's ten thousand - enough to buy new ones."

The check sailed through the air in an arc.

Sophia watched the fluttering paper, her eyes turning icy.

"Such generosity, Mr. Lowell. One might mistake this for charity."

She stepped on the fallen check with her heel.

Christopher's face darkened instantly. "Sophia, don't push your luck."

His assistant stepped forward, lowering his voice threateningly. "Know when to stop, Ms. Laurent. Crossing the Lowells won't end well for you."

Sophia walked straight to the officers.

"Officers, there's been trespassing and attempted bribery at my company. I'd like to file a formal complaint."

Her voice was clear and composed.

The officer nodded. "Do you have surveillance footage?"

"The security room is on the second floor."

Sophia led them toward the elevator.

Christopher shoved past his bodyguards. "Sophia! Stop right there!"

No one turned back.

Ten minutes later, the officers returned with bodycam footage.

"We have sufficient evidence. Take him away."

Two officers immediately restrained Christopher.

He struggled violently. "Do you know who I am? Sophia! You'll regret this!"

Sophia watched coldly.

The assistant approached with a grim expression. "Ms. Laurent, you're no match for the Lowell family."

"Thanks for the warning."

Sophia suddenly smiled. "I almost forgot - your specialty is exploiting legal loopholes."

She turned toward the private elevator.

Custodial staff quickly cleaned the scene.

Inside her office, Sophia dialed Patriarch Valdemar.

"Grandfather, it's me."

A kind voice answered. "Sophia dear, calling at this hour?"

"I need your help with something."

After a brief explanation, Patriarch Valdemar's voice turned grave. "They dared bully my granddaughter-in-law? Leave this to me."
###Chapter 116

The Lowell Group had dominated the business world for years with deep roots and extensive connections. A minor issue like Christopher Lowell's should have been resolved with a single phone call.

Christopher thought so too.

When the police took him away, he remained completely calm. With a lazy glance at his assistant, he followed them without hesitation.

He assumed it was just a formality. He'd be released before even setting foot in the station.

But to his surprise, after interrogation, he was directly locked in a holding cell.

"What's the meaning of this? Where's my lawyer?" Christopher frowned.

This wasn't his first time at the police station.

Previously, he'd always been bailed out immediately after arrival.

"You're suspected of intentional property damage. The assessed loss exceeds five thousand dollars, meeting the case filing threshold."

The officer paused. "If no settlement is reached, you'll face ten days detention plus fines, along with full compensation for damages."

"I'll pay ten times the amount!" Christopher said darkly. "I already gave her a check. I'll add more if needed. You have no right to detain me."

"Sorry, the victim refused compensation. The check has been returned to your assistant."

Christopher's face turned stormy.

"Do you know who I am? Get Commissioner Woods here—"

The officer's brow furrowed.

"The law applies equally to everyone."

With that, he gestured dismissively. "Take him away."

Christopher looked like he'd swallowed a fly.

Meanwhile.

The assistant immediately called William Lowell.

"Mr. Lowell, there's trouble."

William was still reeling from Sophia Laurent establishing Pearl Entertainment. With the company in chaos, his mind was elsewhere.

He glanced at the caller ID and rubbed his temples.

"What is it?"

Christopher should have returned from filming to attend the "River Banquet" premiere.

"Mr. Christopher was taken by the police. The lawyer's bail request was denied. Could you—"

"What happened?" William's frown deepened.

"He just broke some things. The other party refused compensation and called the police directly..."

This wasn't Christopher's first offense. William was used to it.

"Whose property was damaged? I'll handle it." He suppressed his irritation. "I'll make some calls to the station."

The assistant sighed in relief.

"It was Pearl Entertainment's reception desk. Just some inexpensive items."

William: "..."

Silence fell.

With anyone else, the Lowell name would suffice. Especially now with the Valdemar connection.

But of course, it had to be Sophia.
###Chapter 117

That woman was utterly unyielding now. Getting her to relent was harder than scaling the heavens.

William Lowell took a long moment to collect himself before exhaling sharply. "What madness possessed Christopher to provoke Sophia?"

His assistant caught the edge of displeasure in his voice and discreetly glanced at the delicate Emily in the backseat.

"Third Young Master heard about Sophia's recent actions and intended to advise her to show restraint," the assistant chose his words carefully. "But Sophia not only refused to listen, she insulted him. In the heat of the moment, he vandalized Pearl Group..."

A vein throbbed at William's temple.

Just hearing the name "Sophia" triggered a headache now.

"Enough. I'll handle it." He massaged his forehead. "Tell Christopher to stay away from Sophia from now on."

That woman was like a bristling cat now—untouchable.

But no matter how troublesome she was, she couldn't possibly cause real waves.

The turmoil at Valdemar Group was escalating. Sooner or later, it would reach her.

And then...

Though puzzled, the assistant nodded. "Understood. I'll relay your message."

After hanging up, William dialed another number.

"Commissioner Woods, long time no see." His tone was familiar, almost jovial.

A hearty laugh came through the line. "Thanks to you, I'm doing well."

"When are you free for a drink? My treat."

"Ah, my health hasn't been great lately. Can't handle alcohol these days."

After some small talk, William got to the point. "Truth be told, I have a favor to ask..."

The line went silent for two seconds.

"This is about your brother, isn't it?" Commissioner Woods' chuckle carried understanding.

William didn't deny it. "Youngsters act rashly. I hope you can overlook this. I'll personally bring him to apologize."

"No need for apologies."

The Commissioner's voice turned stern. "We're law-abiding citizens. Illegal activities mustn't be tolerated, don't you agree?"

"Of course, you're absolutely right."

William forced a laugh while mentally cursing Christopher to hell.

Of all people, why provoke Sophia?

That woman was all thorns now—impossible to touch.

"Ah..."

Commissioner Woods sighed heavily. "It's not that I won't help you, but this time it's truly impossible. Perhaps... try someone else?"

William's heart skipped a beat.

For someone of the Commissioner's standing, bailing someone out over minor vandalism should've been effortless.

"This..."

Sensing his shock, Commissioner Woods lowered his voice. "Your brother kicked an iron plate this time. Orders came directly from above—due process must be followed. No exceptions."
###Chapter 118

William Lowell's brow furrowed deeply. "Even you... can't do anything about it?"

"Hmm." Commissioner Woods sighed quietly. "It's better to stay in one's lane. There's always someone stronger..."

The line fell silent.

"Discipline your brother properly when he gets out." The commissioner's voice grew stern. "Before he causes real trouble."

The call ended abruptly.

William's knuckles turned white around his phone.

Suddenly remembering something urgent, he dialed Sophia's number.

"Beep—"

The mechanical tone made his expression darken instantly.

"Bang!"

Files scattered across the office floor as he swept them aside.

William's chest heaved violently.

After a long pause, he called Christopher's assistant.

"How could Christopher suddenly go after Sophia during closed filming?"

The assistant glanced nervously at Emily before—

"Let me."

Emily took the phone, her eyes red-rimmed. "Big brother..." Her voice trembled with tears. "It's all my fault..."

"When third brother asked about family matters, I spoke without thinking..."

Sobs carried through the receiver.

William's chest tightened.

"Not your fault." He softened his tone. "You know how hotheaded Christopher is."

"But..." Emily choked out, "Sister got hurt because of me—"

"Sophia's just petty!" William's voice turned icy. "This has nothing to do with you."

A faint smile flickered in Emily's eyes.

"Should I apologize to her?" she asked timidly. "If she'll forgive—"

"Absolutely not!"

William's refusal was final.

"She's the one who owes apologies."

His tone gentled. "Don't worry. Sophia can't cause any real waves."

"Mmm..." Emily responded obediently. "Let me know if you need anything."

"You..." William sighed. "If only Sophia had half your sense..."

"Sister's actually quite kind—"

"Only you would defend her." William snorted.

Emily's lips curved slightly.

"Big brother..." She suddenly lowered her voice. "About Mom asking for money last time..."

William froze.

He'd just transferred 1.5 million last month.

Again?
###Chapter 119

William Lowell drummed his fingers on the desk, his brow furrowed.

The bank transfer notification on his phone screen weighed on him like a stone.

"Big brother..." Emily Lowell's voice quivered through the phone. "Mom's really upset."

A vein throbbed at William's temple.

He knew all about Sophia Laurent's outrageous demand for nine million.

"Sophia doesn't deserve this money," he ground out.

But the image of Emily's tearful face softened his resolve.

"I own an apartment downtown," William exhaled sharply. "Sell it and give the money to Mom."

The words felt like a knife twisting in his chest.

That property was his grandfather's wedding gift—a prime location now worth over ten million.

"Really?" Emily's voice brightened instantly. "You're the best, big brother!"

Her saccharine tone eased his pain slightly.

"Anything for you," he forced a smile.

Consider it disaster prevention money.

After Sophia sent her own father to prison, who knew what she'd do next?

Emily hung up, a cold smirk curling her lips.

She immediately dialed Victoria Lowell.

"Mom..." she drawled, injecting vulnerability into her tone.

"What is it?" Victoria sounded exhausted.

"Don't be angry," Emily softened her voice. "I've secured the nine million..."

Silence.

"Where did you get that kind of money?" Victoria's pitch rose sharply.

"A friend loaned it to me." Emily kept her tone light. "I couldn't let you face a lawsuit."

Victoria's voice cracked.

"My sweet girl," she choked out. "Those ungrateful sons of mine are useless in a crisis!"

Emily's eyes glinted with contempt.

"The boys care about you too," she lied smoothly.

If not for the Lowell Entertainment shares, she wouldn't lift a finger for the old hag.

"Come for dinner tonight," Victoria's mood visibly lifted. "I'll have the kitchen make your favorite sweet and sour ribs."

"Of course." Emily's reply dripped honey.

She hung up and immediately opened a real estate app.

She'd had her eye on that apartment for ages.

Not only would this solve the immediate problem, but she'd profit handsomely.

That fool Sophia had unwittingly done her a favor.
###Chapter 120

The assistant exhaled sharply after ending the call with William Lowell.

He directed the driver to take Emily Lowell to her destination while rushing back to the police station with the lawyer.

"Christopher Lowell is charged with intentional property damage with aggravating circumstances," the officer stated impassively. "He's sentenced to ten days detention and a fine of one thousand yuan."

"What?" The assistant shot up from his seat. "That's impossible!"

He gestured to the lawyer beside him. "We're willing to compensate for all damages. This punishment is excessive!"

The officer pulled up surveillance footage. "The video clearly shows premeditated destruction."

Beads of sweat formed on the assistant's forehead.

He stepped into a corner and redialed William's number.

"Don't bother me!" William snapped, still fuming over the villa incident. "I can't deal with this now!"

The assistant's hand trembled slightly around the phone.

"Mr. Lowell, if the third young master gets detained, the company's reputation—"

A loud thud interrupted him as William slammed his desk.

"Tell PR to draft a statement blaming everything on Sophia Laurent!"

The assistant paled.

Ending the call, he forced himself to approach the officer again.

"We'll pay twenty times the damages. Could you possibly—"

"Take it up with the victim," the officer cut him off.

The assistant clenched his fists.

He knew Sophia wouldn't let Christopher off easily.

For the first time, resentment toward Emily surfaced in his mind.

If she hadn't gone crying to Christopher, he wouldn't have lost control.

But the real villain was Sophia.

That venomous woman would even scheme against her own brother.

A cold glint flashed in the assistant's eyes.

He would make Sophia pay for this.

At the police station, Christopher's face mask was removed.

Gasps erupted around the room.
###Chapter 121

The police announcement came abruptly.

Property damage cases usually aren't serious enough to draw much attention.

But this was different.

Who was Christopher Lowell? A top-tier celebrity with millions of devoted fans.

The moment news of his detention broke, sharp-eyed netizens screenshotted and reposted it.

The hashtag #TopCelebChristopherDetainedForVandalism instantly exploded across the internet.

The top three trending spots were all dominated by related topics.

Fan groups erupted into chaos.

Sure, Chris has a temper, but there must be a reason!

Vandalism? That's worth detention?

He could pay ten times the damages without blinking!

This has to be the first time a top celeb got detained over something so trivial!

Fans flooded discussions with frantic comments.

Details? What exactly did he damage?

Who dared provoke our Chris?

If I find out who, I'll curse their ancestors into oblivion!

There were plenty of eyewitnesses at Pearl Group that day.

Soon, insiders began leaking information.

I saw Christopher smash things at Pearl Group with my own eyes.

It was because of Sophia Laurent.

Just some phones, cups, and brochures—how much could those even cost?

...

As more photos from the scene circulated, the truth became clearer.

Fans who learned the full story went ballistic.

Is Sophia insane? Calling the cops on her own brother?

No wonder the Lowells hate her—she's twisted!

I heard Nathan Lowell lost all his endorsements because of her!

Why doesn't that viper just die?

Pearl Group, right? Let's storm their accounts, girls!

The fan army mobilized swiftly.

Pearl Group's official account was the first target.

Then came Sophia's Composer T profile.

Even Lucas Sheridan and the "Empress" official page weren't spared.

A tidal wave of vitriol crashed down.

Fans of Emily Lowell, Richard Lowell, and Nathan Lowell joined the fray.

Comment sections turned into cesspools of profanity.

A handful of rational netizens tried to interject.

If the police detained him, doesn't that mean Christopher actually broke the law?

What's wrong with someone exercising their legal rights?

But their voices were quickly drowned out.

Even worse, major gossip accounts suddenly launched a coordinated attack.

All targeting Sophia Laurent.
###Chapter 122

The trending list exploded overnight.

#MusicQueenSophiaLaurentOnceLickedBootsOfRichFamily#
#SophiaLaurentHomewreckerHistoryExposed#
#HeirWinstonStolenFromChildhoodSweetheartByMusicMogul#

Marketing accounts coordinated their attacks, flooding the internet with salacious revelations.

The allegations were a toxic mix of truth and fiction.

At the center were Ethan Winston, heir to the Winston Group conglomerate, music icon Sophia Laurent, and socialite Isabella Evans.

The Winston Group owned multiple entertainment companies, making Ethan a regular fixture in both business and gossip columns.

He was considered one of "Hollywood's Three Most Eligible Bachelors" alongside William Lowell and Alexander Valdemar.

The exposé detailed Ethan and Isabella's childhood romance.

Their families were old money acquaintances who grew up together.

The post included intimate childhood photos of the pair.

Young Ethan held Isabella's hand, his sunlit smile radiating pure affection.

Comments erupted:

"OMG! This is fairy-tale love!"
"The way Ethan looks at Isabella—so tender!"
"So she's the legendary first love!"
"Now THIS is a power couple!"

Then the narrative took a sharp turn.

Subsequent photos showed Sophia with Ethan.

Ethan remained stone-faced while Sophia beamed in every shot.

One showed Sophia waiting outside Winston Tower late at night.
Another captured her serving Ethan soup with excessive enthusiasm.
A particularly damning image depicted Sophia struggling to support a drunken Ethan.

Public outrage mounted:

"Disgusting! She's clearly throwing herself at him!"
"No shame chasing wealth and status!"
"Homewreckers deserve hell!"
"No wonder Isabella left the country—who could endure this?"

Sophia scrolled through the posts with a bitter smile.

The photos were real.
The events had indeed occurred.

She and Ethan got together a year after Isabella's departure.

During a family memorial trip, she'd recognized Ethan as the boy who once saved her life.

From then on, she quietly followed his career.

After Isabella left, Ethan drowned himself in alcohol.

She'd only approached him out of concern.

Then Ethan unexpectedly proposed dating.
###Chapter 123

Ethan Winston's voice was soft, yet it landed like a stone breaking the calm surface of a lake.

"Sophia Laurent, let's give this a try."

Her eyelashes fluttered in surprise. But she nodded quickly.

She didn't dislike Ethan. In fact, she rather admired him.

The photos leaked by the media were taken a year into their relationship. Ethan's expression was as aloof as ever in those pictures. At the time, she hadn't noticed anything amiss.

Looking back now, his reluctance was obvious.

What had he really been thinking?

Where did she stand in his heart these past three years?

Sophia closed her eyes briefly, her chest tightening.

The sudden ringtone shattered her thoughts.

"Sophia, have you seen the news?" Oliver Granger's voice crackled with urgency.

She steadied herself. "I have."

"Should PR issue a statement immediately?"

Sophia frowned in contemplation.

The backlash was overwhelming. First Christopher Lowell's arrest, now her relationship with Ethan being twisted into something ugly. The internet was a chorus of vitriol.

Clearly, multiple parties were fueling the fire.

"Have PR release a statement," she paused. "As for Ethan and me..."

He probably wouldn't cooperate.

Hanging up, she opened her social media. Private messages flooded in, freezing her phone momentarily.

Each one was a venomous curse.

Homewrecker. Monster. Deserving of death. Every word pierced her heart.

The comments section was no better.

Pressing her lips together, she quickly drafted a post:

[Truth speaks for itself]

She attached the surveillance footage of Christopher vandalizing Pearl Group's offices.

The video sparked an immediate shift in public opinion.

"Christopher's behavior is outrageous!"

"Anyone would've called the police. That's blatant vandalism."

"Rumors of his arrogance were true. The Lowells always covered for him."

"Serves him right. His malice is written all over his face."

Christopher's fans lashed out:

"Sophia pushed him too far!"

"Why would he target only her? She must've provoked him!"

"Compared to Emily Lowell, Sophia's nothing!"
###Chapter 124

Sophia's fans and neutral observers fought back against Christopher's supporters.

"Can Christopher's fans be reasonable for once? Admit your mistakes when you're wrong!"

"The official report clearly states a ten-day detention and fine. Isn't that evidence enough?"

Christopher's fans ignored the facts and attacked Sophia instead.

"Her own family hates her. That proves she's bad luck!"

"Homewrecker deserves to die!"

"How can anyone enjoy her music after seeing her throw herself at Ethan?"

Sophia's supporters fired back.

"Personal relationships and artistic work are separate matters!"

"Christopher broke the law as a public figure. Is that idol material?"

Though fewer in number, Sophia's fans fought fiercely.

Amid the heated battle, Sophia suddenly updated her social media.

A single line appeared:
"My relationship with Ethan Winston began one year after Isabella left. We've since broken up."

Her fans' morale soared instantly.

"Media lies! It was a normal relationship!"

"Clearly someone's targeting Sophia. The mastermind is obvious!"

"I used to think the Lowells were perfect. Now I see they're all problematic."

Trolls and paid accounts persisted.

"Homewrecker trying to whitewash herself?"

"Her desperate behavior proves it was premeditated!"

"When your whole family hates you, there must be something wrong!"

As arguments raged, Sophia's phone rang.

An unknown number.

She leaned back lazily and answered.

"Sophia, it's me."

Ethan's gentle voice came through.

Her expression remained blank. "What do you want?"

"Do we have to be so distant?"

Her eyes turned icy. "Mr. Winston, we were never close."

Ethan sighed. "What were those three years then?"

"A lapse in judgment."

Ethan fell silent.

"Have you forgotten everything I did for you?"

Sophia's left hand clenched briefly before relaxing.

"You were good to me, and I repaid you in kind. We're even."

Truthfully, Ethan had treated her well.

Never missed a birthday surprise.

Always brought gifts from business trips.
###Chapter 125

Sophia Laurent had once been abused by her adoptive parents and misunderstood by her biological family.

In her naivety, she believed Ethan Winston was the only person in the world who truly cared for her.

Back then, she was so desperate for love that she romanticized every little thing Ethan did as kindness.

On the other end of the call, Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

When Sophia received no response after a long pause, her voice turned icy. "If you have nothing else to say, Mr. Winston, I'm hanging up."

Ethan finally snapped out of his thoughts.

"Have you seen the posts online?"

Hearing his deliberately stern tone, Sophia frowned. "I have."

She forced her voice to sound indifferent. "And?"

"If you apologize to Gabrielle, I'll help clear your name."

Sophia couldn't believe her ears. "You want me to apologize to Gabrielle Winston?"

"For hitting her," Ethan said, his tone laced with authority. "Sophia, you weren't like this before."

In the past, she had always endured Gabrielle's bullying without complaint.

Because Gabrielle was his sister.

The Winstons had spoiled their daughter rotten since childhood—even Ethan couldn't control her.

Sophia let out a bitter laugh. "That's because I was stupid back then."

Her voice was firm. "I won't apologize. She doesn't deserve it."

That slap wasn't just for Gabrielle insulting her unborn child.

It was for all the years of humiliation Gabrielle had put her through.

Gabrielle had branded her a seductress who lured her brother away, targeting her at every turn and publicly shaming her.

Sophia had swallowed her pride for Ethan's sake.

And in return, Gabrielle only grew bolder.

She was nothing but a spoiled heiress with a fragile ego.

Ethan's voice sharpened with urgency. "Sophia, do you really want to cut ties with the Winstons?"

This time, Gabrielle hadn't just cried to him—she'd dragged their parents into it.

They'd vowed to teach Sophia a lesson themselves.

The thought alone gave Ethan a headache.

"Sophia, be reasonable. I'm doing this for your own good."

Sophia almost laughed at the absurdity.

After a long silence, she spoke slowly. "Ethan, are you out of your mind?"

Her words were deliberate. "Or do you just not understand human language?"

Ethan was rendered speechless.

His frustration boiled over. "Sophia, you've changed! Do you really think I'd harm you?"

Sophia gave a soft, humorless chuckle. "Who knows?"

She paused, her voice glacial. "After all, we're nothing to each other now."

Even clearing her name came with the condition of her bowing her head in apology.

She must have been blind to ever love a man like him.
###Chapter 126

Ethan's grip tightened around his phone, his knuckles turning white.

"Sophia, must you go this far?"

His voice trembled with suppressed rage, veins pulsing at his temple.

Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, twilight painted his brooding profile in somber hues.

Isabella's elopement with that foreign professor remained the deepest wound in his heart.

"Mr. Winston must have a selective memory."

Sophia's icy tone cut through the line.

"Shall I remind you of your drunken confession three years ago?"

Her fingers tapped the desk in a slow, deliberate rhythm.

Ethan's breath hitched.

That night... he'd said things he shouldn't have.

"Let's end this online feud."

His tone softened abruptly. "Give me time to handle it."

"Too late."

The line went dead with Sophia's crisp dismissal.

As the screen darkened, a Twitter notification flashed.

#WinstonGroupAnnouncesEngagement#

The trending tag led to an official statement from Winston Group's verified account.

"We are pleased to announce the engagement of Mr. Ethan Winston and Ms. Isabella Evans on the fifteenth of next month..."

Comments exploded instantly.

"The queen returns! Homewrecker better scram!"

"How's that crow taste, Sophia stans?"

"Old money marries old money - as it should be!"

Sophia skimmed the remarks with a cold chuckle.

She dialed a number. "Get me Isabella's overseas hotel records. High-definition preferred."

The Winston mansion blazed with light.

Gabrielle lounged on the sofa scrolling through social media when she suddenly giggled.

"Look, sis! Netizens are gushing over your perfect match!"

She thrust her phone at Isabella.

The screen displayed expertly photoshopped engagement photos.

Isabella offered a demure smile, though unease flickered in her eyes.

"That bitch Sophia..."

Gabrielle lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Should we buy more troll accounts?"

"Don't overdo it."

Isabella caressed her engagement ring. "Your brother won't like it."

"Who cares!"

Gabrielle tossed her hair. "I'm pushing the 'Serial Mistress' hashtag right now!"

Her fingers flew across the screen, missing Isabella's frozen smile.
###Chapter 127

Isabella's fingers glided across her phone screen as the venomous comments scrolled past.

A faint smile touched her lips. "Gabrielle, let it go."

Gabrielle frowned. "She's just a homewrecker who took advantage of the situation."

"She was with your brother once." Isabella locked her phone. "Let's all keep some dignity."

Gabrielle scoffed. "That woman will never set foot in the Winston family."

She linked arms with Isabella affectionately. "You're the only one I'll ever call sister-in-law."

Isabella chuckled at her antics. "You..."

"I secured that internship at Versini Couture." She patted Gabrielle's hand. "Start tomorrow."

Gabrielle's eyes lit up. "Really?"

She threw her arms around Isabella. "You're the best!"

Isabella's gaze grew distant.

Her overseas relationship had shown her the harsh truth.

The once-devoted boy had revealed his true colors abroad.

Now when she returned, Ethan had Sophia by his side.

But it didn't matter.

The Winston elders' hearts still belonged to her.

Lowell Family Villa.

Richard smashed the vase on the coffee table the moment he hung up.

"What happened?" Victoria jumped to her feet.

"That ungrateful daughter!" Richard's face darkened. "She had Christopher arrested!"

Victoria paled.

Just as the nine million scandal settled, new trouble arose?

Emily's eyes reddened. "It's all my fault..."

"Just worthless junk anyway." Richard ground his teeth. "She's deliberately causing trouble!"

He paced the living room.

"River Banquet starts filming soon. She's trying to ruin us!"

William's expression remained cold. "The Valdemars intervened. We can't get him out now."

He scrolled through his phone. "But she's getting her comeuppance."

The internet overflowed with vitriol against Sophia.

Trolls led the charge while netizens followed suit.

"The Valdemars won't tolerate this scandal." William narrowed his eyes. "Just wait and see."
###Chapter 128

Richard Lowell slammed his teacup onto the coffee table with a jarring clatter.

"Sophia Laurent has gone completely rogue! The Valdemars doing her the favor of disciplining her should be considered a blessing."

His face darkened with rage, veins bulging at his temples.

"We arranged that marriage hoping she'd support the family. Instead, she's working against us at every turn."

William Lowell smirked, fingers drumming against the armrest.

"Does she actually believe the Valdemars value her? She's just a disposable ornament."

"Everyone knows she's the other woman who broke up a relationship. The Valdemars prize their reputation—they'll discard her soon enough."

His eyes narrowed with icy malice.

"Once the Valdemar succession is settled, no matter who takes charge, she'll face consequences."

Richard snorted, lifting a freshly poured cup.

"Pearl Entertainment is doomed. That narrow-minded girl thinks she's fit to lead?"

William suddenly wore a calculating smile.

"If she had any sense, she'd merge Pearl Entertainment with Lowell Entertainment now to save herself."

"Pity..."

Richard shook his head in disdain.

"Trash from the gutter will always be trash."

Victoria Lowell sat silently in the corner.

She remembered the first time she saw Sophia—a timid girl in ill-fitting hand-me-downs, standing awkwardly at the doorway.

She'd wept from pity then.

But now...

Sophia's constant hostility toward Emily and erratic behavior made affection impossible.

Emily was so considerate.

Not only gentle and attentive, but she'd even covered that nine-million deficit.

As for Sophia...

If only she'd return to that docile girl from before, perhaps there'd still be hope.

Emily Lowell lingered at the staircase landing, lips curling upward.

Blood daughter or not?

She'd been thoroughly eclipsed by her adopted sister.

What did Sophia's competence matter?

In the Lowell family, no one would ever take her side.

Ethan Winston wouldn't spare her a second glance either.

She was destined to be the joke.

Online sentiment had completely reversed after Ethan's statement.

The internet flooded with vitriol against Sophia.

"Congratulations to Mr. Winston and Miss Evans! Some people should know their place."

"Childhood sweethearts are so pure. Homewreckers should disappear."

"Mr. Winston's direct rebuke must sting. How's that face feeling, Miss Laurent?"

Each comment cut deeper than the last.
###Chapter 129

Morning sunlight filtered through the curtains as Sophia Laurent's phone vibrated.

A compressed file from the private investigator sat quietly in her inbox.

She opened her social media app. The private message inbox was overflowing. Some messages contained vicious insults, while others offered warm encouragement.

The most surprising was Adrian Valentine's post at 3 AM.

The usually gentle music icon's words burned with anger: "Have some people lost their minds? Adults should think for themselves instead of blaming victims. @SophiaLaurent, ignore those keyboard warriors. I've got your back."

With Adrian's massive fanbase, the post instantly trended.

Comments flooded in with overwhelming support.

Sophia stared at the screen, fingers trembling slightly.

She never expected this near-stranger, a professional acquaintance at best, to stand up for her during her darkest hour.

She quickly replied: "@AdrianValentine, thank you!"

Then she forwarded the investigator's dossier to major gossip accounts.

If the Winstons could weaponize public opinion against her, she'd fight fire with fire.

Within thirty minutes, explosive hashtags dominated trends:

#Shocking! Scion Of Wealthy Family Cheated On - Drunken Video Leaked#
#Music Prodigy Two-Timed - Dumped Childhood Friend For Foreign Lover#
#Plot Twist! So-Called First Love Was Serial Cheater#

The threads contained irrefutable evidence against Ethan Winston and Isabella Evans.

Timelines clearly showed Isabella had left for abroad with a foreign music student four years prior - long before Sophia ever met Ethan.

The most damning evidence was a nine-photo collage showing Isabella making out with her foreign boyfriend in a bar, straddling him while scantily clad.

Comments erupted:

"OMG! This changes everything!"
"Isabella's behavior is downright trashy!"
"So Sophia was the real victim here?"
"Poor Sophia! Dealing with these two must be karma for past sins!"

The tide of public opinion began turning.
###Chapter 130

The internet had been reveling in Ethan Winston and Isabella Evans' fairytale romance.

Then the bomb dropped—news broke of Isabella's affair with a foreign boyfriend.

Sophia Laurent transformed overnight from the vilified "other woman" to the most innocent victim.

She suffered terribly, framed by that despicable couple despite doing nothing wrong.

Ethan knew the truth yet deliberately misled the public, directing the online mob against Sophia.

Disgusting behavior.

Netizens finally saw the light, flooded with remorse.

Their previous vitriol turned to overwhelming guilt.

"Sophia, I'm so sorry for attacking you without knowing the facts."

"I'm deleting all my hateful comments now."

"Thank goodness you cut ties with that trash. You deserve so much better."

Overnight, the smear campaigns vanished—only a handful of diehard Lowell family fans remained bitter.

Sophia didn't care.

She was waiting for the private investigator's report.

Since Christopher Lowell insisted on self-destruction, she'd happily deliver his comeuppance.

Ethan Winston's office at Winston Group.

The CEO glared at his screen, face stormy.

Public opinion had flipped overnight.

He and Isabella were now universally reviled.

The door burst open.

Gabrielle Winston stormed in, furious.

"Brother! Has Sophia lost her mind? How dare she do this to you?"

Her voice dripped with disbelief. "She adored you! Why would she let the internet attack you?"

Ethan's temple throbbed.

He wondered the same—when had Sophia changed?

He'd explained the birthday incident.

The thought pressed on his chest like a boulder.

Gabrielle ranted on: "Since she's playing dirty, we should expose her! I saw her at the OB-GYN—she's probably pregnant, trying to trap you—"

"Enough!" Ethan snapped. "That's impossible."

Gabrielle faltered. "But—"

"No buts." His tone brooked no argument.

She bit her lip. Sophia's reaction that day had been suspicious...

Yet her brother seemed certain.

"What now?" she whispered. "Is Isabella really..."

"Ancient history." Ethan's voice turned glacial.

Isabella's past meant nothing.

This engagement was merely a chess move to seize Winston Group.
###Chapter 131

Gabrielle Winston bit her lip, her face etched with frustration.

"Are we just letting the online scandal slide?"

Ethan Winston snapped out of his thoughts, his expression indifferent.

"The buzz will fade eventually."

Right now, securing control of the company was his top priority.

"Fine." Gabrielle answered half-heartedly.

Her plan to force Sophia Laurent into a public apology had failed.

Her stiletto heels clicked sharply against the floor.

She couldn't swallow this humiliation.

Suddenly, Gabrielle's eyes lit up.

If her brother was so certain Sophia wasn't pregnant, then her visit to the OB-GYN...

Could she be carrying a bastard child?

Ethan noticed her shifting expression and frowned.

"I'll buy you that jewelry collection you wanted last time." He handed her a check. "Stay away from Sophia."

Most importantly, he needed to prevent her from stirring trouble in front of their parents.

"Really?" Gabrielle's face instantly brightened. "You're the best, brother!"

She snatched the check. "Don't worry, I promise I won't bother her..."

Yeah, right.

Since when had Miss Winston ever accepted defeat?

After dismissing his sister, Ethan absently twirled the fountain pen in his hand.

It was a custom piece Sophia had gifted him for his birthday last year.

Posts about Ethan Winston and Isabella Evans gradually disappeared across platforms.

Anyone with eyes could tell Winston Corporation was pulling strings behind the scenes.

Though the posts were gone, the truth had already spread.

Netizens flooded Sophia's accounts with apologies.

Only Christopher Lowell's fans continued making noise.

Even if she wasn't the other woman, Sophia was no saint—why else would her own family despise her?

Christopher had such a gentle temperament; smashing things must've been an accident. How dare she call the police!

That vicious woman clearly wanted to ruin her own brother!

Just as the fans reached peak outrage, a new wave of exposés flooded the internet.

#Shocking Footage: A-List Star Assaults Rookie Actor On Set#

#Exclusive: Christopher Lowell's Hit-and-Run Leaves Victim Severely Injured#

#Insider Report: Top Actor Bullied Co-Star Into Depression and Career Exit#

Christopher's scandals erupted like a volcano.
###Chapter 132

Sophia Laurent's fingers trembled slightly as she stared at the barrage of explosive posts flooding her computer screen.

Each post meticulously documented Christopher Lowell's misdeeds over the years, accompanied by irrefutable evidence.

Christopher had skyrocketed to fame through a youth idol drama, building his public persona as a hardworking heir from a wealthy family.

But his true colors emerged after achieving stardom.

On set, he frequently arrived late and left early, treating crew members like servants.

During variety show recordings, he often walked off when dissatisfied with the script.

Most shockingly, he had committed a hit-and-run while driving drunk, leaving a newlywed couple severely injured in the hospital.

"We don't want compensation. We just want justice." The couple lay bandaged in their hospital beds during the video testimony.

A former actress forced out of the industry accused, "He bullied me relentlessly on set, abusing his celebrity status."

These revelations detonated like bombs across social media.

Sophia was stunned to discover Christopher's crimes far exceeded her worst assumptions.

The internet erupted.

"My God, is this really Christopher Lowell?"

"The evidence is overwhelming. It must be true."

"I feel terrible for his genuine fans..."

His devoted fanbase took the hardest hit.

They couldn't believe their idol of many years was such a monster.

Some dug up old fan videos, realizing his so-called "heartwarming gestures" had all been staged.

"We've been deceived..." The fan groups echoed with collective anguish.

Fans who had scrimped to buy his albums now felt physically ill.

They desperately searched for counterevidence, only to find each accusation watertight.

Sophia experienced mixed emotions watching this unfold.

She hadn't expected the private investigator to uncover so much damning material.

The victims' decision to come forward now clearly signaled they'd reached their breaking point.

Public opinion shifted instantly.

The attacks previously directed at Sophia now targeted Christopher.

"Someone like this doesn't deserve to be an idol!"

"He should be blacklisted!"

Sophia gently closed her laptop and exhaled deeply.

This battle was hers.
###Chapter 133

The evidence against Christopher Lowell was overwhelming.

Every detail was meticulously documented—dates, locations, names.

Victims came forward with firsthand accounts, sealing his fate in disgrace.

While Nathan Lowell had merely lost fans and endorsements for his fabricated talent, Christopher was now universally condemned for his moral corruption.

The hashtag #BanChristopherLowell swept across social media.

"Such scum doesn't deserve to be an idol!"

"A public figure flouting the law must face severe consequences!"

"Boycott Christopher Lowell—never buy his endorsed products again!"

The backlash grew louder by the hour.

His once-devoted fans finally saw the truth.

Beneath that handsome face lay a rotten heart.

Hordes of fans abandoned him, turning their support into condemnation.

The top ten trending topics were all about his downfall.

No paid trolls could control the narrative this time—public opinion was unanimous.

Major brands rushed to terminate contracts.

Exorbitant penalty fees piled up.

Lowell Entertainment's PR team was in chaos.

But for once, they couldn't delete or suppress the truth.

A trembling assistant called William Lowell.

"Chairman, it's a disaster..."

William had already seen the news.

"That bitch Sophia Laurent is ruining Christopher!"

The sound of shattering porcelain echoed through his office.

He futilely ordered the PR team to scrub posts and whitewash the scandal.

But against the tide of public outrage, their efforts were useless.

Sophia watched the storm unfold with cold detachment.

"He dug his own grave."

Christopher, locked in a detention cell, remained oblivious to the outside world.

He only noticed the police treating him with increasing severity.

Old cases from years ago resurfaced.

Though settled out of court, his driver's license was revoked for five years.

"Do you know who I am?" Christopher raged.

An officer retorted sharply, "The law applies to everyone equally!"

A venomous glint flashed in his eyes.

"Sophia... just you wait."

The scandal prompted more apologies to Sophia.

Her fan count skyrocketed.
###Chapter 134

Richard Lowell nearly passed out from rage.

The conference room at Lowell Entertainment was piled with breach notices from major brands.

Christopher Lowell's scandal was far worse than Nathan Lowell's.

Not only was his reputation ruined, but he also faced astronomical penalty fees.

The worst blow was to the anticipated blockbuster "River Banquet."

The film's official social media was flooded with demands to remove Christopher.

Richard shattered his third teacup in fury.

"Replace him! Immediately!"

He summoned an emergency meeting and decided to cast Julian Lombardi instead.

Julian was another A-list actor under their banner with a solid fanbase.

But losing two cash cows consecutively had already triggered three trading halts for Lowell Entertainment's stocks.

While Richard raged at home, Sophia Laurent was driving to the city outskirts.

Director Lucas Sheridan had been preoccupied with auditions for "Empress" and hadn't checked the news.

He called Sophia to consult about the original author's casting preferences.

"Any recommendations from investors?" Lucas asked over the phone.

Sophia gripped the steering wheel, a striking face flashing through her mind.

Scarlett Ashcroft.

She'd seen this actress at Lowell Entertainment.

Unlike the saccharine sweet trend, Scarlett had sharp features and piercing eyes.

But the market never warmed to her, leaving her career stagnant.

Sophia had researched her background.

Trained at drama school with solid acting chops, yet only landing minor roles.

Her only viral moment was a cheating scandal where only the boyfriend's blurred back was shown.

Sophia pulled up Scarlett's audition reels.

Even in bit parts, her performances were mesmerizing.

"She's the one." Sophia stepped on the accelerator.

The GPS led to a shabby tenement in the outskirts.

Inside a dilapidated apartment, Scarlett was boiling instant noodles.

She froze when knocks echoed at her door.

"Who is it?"

"Sophia Laurent from Pearl Group."
###Chapter 135

Sophia Laurent stood before the door and pressed the bell lightly.

Footsteps echoed from inside, followed by a brief pause.

"Who is it?" A clear female voice came through the door.

"It's me, Sophia Laurent."

The sound of a turning lock. A sliver of light revealed a delicate face. Scarlett Ashcroft's brows were slightly furrowed, surprise flashing in her eyes.

"Ms. Laurent?" She opened the door wider. "What brings you here?"

Sophia met her gaze directly. "May I come in?"

Scarlett glanced over Sophia's shoulder, confirming she was alone before stepping aside.

The apartment was modest but impeccably tidy. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating potted plants on the coffee table.

"Have a seat." Scarlett offered a glass of water.

Sophia took it and cut straight to the chase. "I'd like to invite you to star in a new production."

Scarlett's fingers twitched.

Since the incident, she'd been completely blacklisted at Lowell Entertainment. Three months without a single audition.

"Is this... Lowell Entertainment's arrangement?" she asked cautiously.

Sophia shook her head. "Pearl Group."

Scarlett's eyes widened.

"Pearl Entertainment, to be precise." Sophia clarified. "I want you to join us."

Scarlett's breathing quickened.

"But my contract—"

"I know about the breach fee." Sophia interrupted. "Just tell me if you're interested."

Scarlett's nails dug unconsciously into the armrest.

Six years ago, she'd signed that contract full of dreams. Now at twenty-four, she'd hit rock bottom in her career.

"The breach fee... is twelve million." She forced out the number.

Sophia's expression didn't flicker.
###Chapter 136

When Scarlett first joined Lowell Entertainment, she was an unknown newcomer.

The contract terms at Lowell Entertainment were notoriously harsh, with exorbitant breach fees.

This was an open secret in the industry.

Nearly all agencies used the same tactics to control their talent.

Sophia wasn't surprised by the penalty amount.

"If Pearl Group is willing to cover your breach fee, would you consider switching agencies?"

"W-what?"

Scarlett was stunned into silence.

Thinking Sophia hadn't heard correctly, she repeated, "My breach fee is ten million."

"I know." Sophia's expression remained calm.

Scarlett hesitated. "You..."

Her career had hit rock bottom. Brands avoided her due to the scandal of being cheated on. Her agent faced constant rejections.

She couldn't fathom why Sophia would invest such a fortune in her.

What was the catch?

Noticing her wariness, Sophia smiled faintly.

"I've seen your work."

She paused. "Every project."

"You're a talented actress with unique presence and solid skills. Understand?"

It took Scarlett a moment to process this.

"Why me?" she murmured.

The industry was full of actresses like her.

"Call it... intuition."

Even Sophia couldn't explain it.

Perhaps she'd immediately envisioned Scarlett as the Empress during their first meeting.

Scarlett studied the young woman before her.

Sophia's exquisite features stood out even among entertainment's most beautiful stars.

Her clear phoenix eyes held undeniable conviction.

"Here's Pearl Group's contract. Review it first."

Scarlett took the document, reading every line carefully.

Sophia waited patiently.

Five minutes later, Scarlett closed the file.

She inhaled deeply. "Ms. Laurent, is this contract genuine?"

Compared to Lowell's predatory terms, this offer seemed too good to be true.

It outlined clear career development and guaranteed annual resources.

The breach fee was shockingly low—only one million, practically symbolic.

Most astonishing was the 50-50 profit split after operational costs—terms reserved for A-list stars.

"Absolutely." Sophia's tone left no room for doubt.

She stood. "If you need time to decide, you can give me your answer tomorrow."
###Chapter 137

Scarlett shook her head without hesitation.

"No need to reconsider."

Her voice was resolute. "I choose Pearl Group."

Missing this opportunity meant remaining buried at Lowell Entertainment forever.

She'd never escape being trampled by that despicable couple.

"There's one more thing..."

Scarlett hesitated, her expression turning uneasy. "May I make another request?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Go on."

"I want to bring my agent with me."

Scarlett's tone held quiet pleading. "She's exceptionally talented, just suppressed by the company. I promise we'll give our all for Pearl Group..."

Sophia's eyes flickered with approval.

Most would abandon their team to save themselves.

Though unfamiliar with this agent, it meant little to Sophia.

The breach fee was negligible.

They only lacked proper opportunities.

"Approved."

Sophia agreed readily. "We'll cover her penalty. She stays with you."

"Really?"

Scarlett's eyes reddened with emotion.

She stood abruptly, bowing deeply. "Ms. Laurent, thank you."

"Mutual benefit."

Sophia slid a card across the table. "Two million. PIN six zeros. Covers penalties and advances your earnings."

Scarlett gaped in shock.

Payment before working?

"Aren't you afraid I'll disappear with the money?"

Sophia chuckled. "You won't."

She'd thoroughly vetted Scarlett.

The money could be taken, but wouldn't be.

Scarlett accepted the card solemnly. "I won't disappoint you."

"Handle the termination now."

Sophia rose. "Come straight to Pearl Group afterward."

"Let me see you out."

After Sophia departed, Scarlett changed quickly.

Masked, she hailed a cab to Lowell Entertainment.

Her heart pounded wildly against her ribs.
###Chapter 138

The Lowell Group headquarters towered in the city's busiest commercial district, its glass facade glittering under the sunlight.

Scarlett Ashcroft walked into Lowell Entertainment's lobby just as a commotion erupted.

"Melanie, if you can't even secure a simple endorsement, what use are you to this company?"

The shrill voice echoed across the marble floors.

Melanie Vance stood at the center of the crowd, her face drained of color.

"Mr. Langley, the deal was practically finalized, but—"

Her gaze flickered toward Tiffany Merouin, who stood opposite her in a crisp white pantsuit, lips painted crimson.

"Someone deliberately sabotaged it, letting Starlight Media swoop in."

Tiffany smirked and tilted her chin up.

"If you're incompetent, don't blame others. Look inward for once."

She tossed a stack of documents from her briefcase.

"I've already reclaimed the endorsement. The contract's signed."

Derek Langley flipped through the pages, his expression softening.

"Three months' salary deduction. One more screwup and you're out."

Melanie clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

This endorsement had taken her three grueling months to negotiate—only for Tiffany to steal it with a single phone call.

But what could she say?

Tiffany managed Julian Lombardi, the reigning Best Actor, and Vanessa Kalmien, the pop diva. Not to mention Emily Lowell, the Lowell heiress.

And her own roster?

A handful of obscure talents no one remembered.

The muffled snickers from colleagues cut deeper than knives.

She recalled when she first joined—the entire agency had only her as a manager.

Julian and Vanessa? Both her discoveries.

Those years she'd spent hustling for gigs, pulling all-nighters for opportunities.

Who remembered now?

Scarlett watched Melanie's hunched shoulders, a dull ache spreading through her chest.

She strode forward.

"No need for salary deductions. Melanie and I are leaving today."

The lobby fell silent.

Veteran employees exchanged uneasy glances.

Everyone knew this was Tiffany systematically crushing Melanie.

But no one dared speak up.

Tiffany currently held sway—even executives tread carefully around her.

Yet if Melanie actually left...

The company would lose at least thirty percent of its resources.

Derek's face darkened.

"Scarlett, know your place!"

He turned to Melanie.

"Control your people."
###Chapter 139

He left those words hanging and strode out of the conference room without looking back.

Tiffany Merouin clicked forward in her ten-centimeter heels, her voice dripping with snark. "Kids these days have no sense of reality. Threatening to terminate contracts over nothing. Does she even have enough to cover a fraction of the breach fee?"

With a sway of her slender waist, she hurried after Derek Langley.

The crowd gradually dispersed.

Only Julian Lombardi remained standing in place.

As Lowell Entertainment's newest top-tier celebrity, fresh off landing the male lead in "River Banquet," he was riding high on his success.

"Scarlett," he drawled, sauntering toward her. "Must you make such a scene?"

Scarlett shot him a frigid glare. "Get lost."

"Still so fiery?" He chuckled, unfazed. "I'm only giving you friendly advice, for old times' sake."

Her fists clenched.

Nails dug deep into her palms.

They had been university sweethearts once, the golden couple everyone envied.

Until he'd hooked up with Derek's niece.

"Karma will come for you," she bit out, each word sharp as a blade.

Julian suddenly leaned in, his whisper brushing her ear. "Heard I got the lead in 'River Banquet'?" His smirk widened. "You'll never catch up to me."

Her pupils constricted.

Melanie Vance quickly pulled her back. "Let's head to the office first."

Julian's taunts chased after them. "Beg me nicely, and maybe I'll throw you a bone—"

Scarlett didn't look back.

The office door shut behind them. Melanie's face was etched with worry.

"Mel," Scarlett said abruptly, "let's resign."

Melanie gave a bitter laugh. "The breach fee isn't small."

For years, Tiffany had bullied them under Derek's protection.

Just as Melanie despaired, Scarlett murmured, "Someone's willing to cover our breach fees."
###Chapter 140

Melanie's frown deepened as she listened to Scarlett's words.

In this cutthroat entertainment industry, free lunches were always traps in disguise.

"Don't be fooled by sweet talk, Scarlett. You might end up counting cash for your own betrayal."

Sophia gently patted her agent's shoulder, noticing her concern.

"Melanie, they're sincere enough to cover the breach fee."

Melanie arched an eyebrow, interest finally piqued.

"What terms did they offer?"

Her voice dripped with skepticism. "Don't jump from Lowell Entertainment straight into hell."

Scarlett pulled a document from her bag, beaming.

"I brought the contract. See for yourself."

"An actual contract?"

Melanie snatched the file, her gaze instantly sharpening.

She scrutinized every clause, her expression growing graver by the second.

After finishing the last page, she flipped back to verify details.

Only after triple-checking did Melanie exhale sharply, locking eyes with Scarlett.

"Who gave you this?"

Scarlett startled at her intensity.

"Is something wrong?"

"Quite the opposite."

Melanie's voice trembled slightly.

"These terms are absurdly generous. Only A-listers get deals like this."

Scarlett's tension dissolved.

"See? I told you it was legit!"

She grabbed Melanie's hands excitedly. "They'll cover your penalty too. Let's sign immediately."

Melanie froze.

"Mine too?"

"Of course! They want us both."

Melanie's mind buzzed before she found her voice.

"Which company has this kind of capital? Starlight? Paramount? Or Titan?"

She listed industry giants.

"None of those."

Scarlett winked mysteriously. "It's Miss Sophia Laurent from Pearl Group."

"Sophia?"

Melanie searched her memory. "The Lowell family's long-lost daughter?"

"Exactly!"

Scarlett's eyes sparkled at Sophia's name.

"You should see her, Melanie. She outshines every starlet on screen."

Melanie chuckled at her starstruck expression.

"What potion did she slip you?"

As a Lowell Entertainment veteran, she'd glimpsed the heiress from afar.
###Chapter 141

Sophia Laurent's features were undeniably exquisite. Yet every time Scarlett Ashcroft saw her, she was clad in a sharply tailored black suit, her hair pulled back in a severe bun, her expression as stern as a judge.

Scarlett tried to picture Sophia in an evening gown and gave a slight nod of approval.

"Ms. Laurent's bone structure is flawless."

The moment the words left her lips, Scarlett chuckled at herself. "Wait—we're supposed to be discussing what our new employer can offer us, not judging a beauty pageant."

Melanie Vance stifled a laugh, her fingers flying across her phone screen.

"The Pearl Group just entered the entertainment industry. Pearl Entertainment was established less than six months ago with fewer than five signed artists..."

As she read the freshly gathered data, her frown deepened.

"Compared to an industry giant like Lowell Entertainment, Pearl is practically a seedling pushing through the soil..."

"So what?"

Sophia's clear, piercing eyes flashed in Scarlett's mind, hardening her voice.

"Lowell may be vast, but it has room for Tiffany Merouin—not for us."

"They milked you dry and buried my talent."

"Staying with Lowell would only bleed us dry."

Ever since Tiffany climbed into bed with a Lowell executive, they'd been cast into the shadows.

"But Pearl is different. They're offering triple the salary, covering our breach fees, and most importantly—"

Scarlett's eyes burned with conviction. "They're giving us dignity."

Melanie stared at her glowing expression, feeling a spark ignite in her own ashen heart.

Lowell had long discarded them like pawns.

Sophia had thrown them a lifeline.

Melanie swallowed hard. "The breach fee..."

"Right here." Scarlett waved a bank card. "Ms. Laurent advanced us twenty million."

She lowered her voice. "Melanie, your mother's transplant is covered."

Melanie's pupils contracted.

All these years of swallowing her pride had been for her bedridden mother awaiting a kidney.

"How much?"

"Twenty million. Every cent."

Melanie clapped a hand over her mouth, her shoulders shaking violently.

When she looked up again, the timidity in her eyes had vanished.

"Let's go." She snatched up her coat. "We're terminating the contract now."

The decisive, elite agent had returned.

Scarlett watched Melanie's straightened back and hurried after her with a smile.

The sharp click of high heels echoed across the marble floor.
###Chapter 142

Derek Langley lounged in his oversized leather chair at Lowell Entertainment's general manager office. Tiffany Merouin nestled against him, allowing his rough hands to roam freely over her body.

"Mr. Langley, that Melanie keeps strutting around the office like she owns the place. It's driving me crazy..."

She dragged out the last syllable with saccharine sweetness.

Derek closed his eyes, savoring the sensation of having a beautiful woman in his arms.

He'd once been a mere slaughterhouse assistant. His current position came solely through his cousin's influence as a top executive at headquarters.

With his average looks and short stature, women wouldn't have glanced at him twice before.

Since gaining power, many had thrown themselves at him, but none matched Tiffany's cunning charm.

"Patience, darling." He pinched her chin. "Keeping her around means you get to watch her suffer daily."

Though uneducated, he wasn't stupid.

Melanie controlled several crucial company projects. Losing her now would tank their performance metrics.

That would jeopardize not just him, but his cousin who'd secured his promotion.

Playtime aside, he understood these stakes perfectly.

Tiffany's eyes gleamed with sudden comprehension.

"Then..." She whispered in his ear, "I heard she's negotiating a major period drama IP. Once it's secured..."

"Your people get it." Derek answered absently, his hand already slipping beneath her collar.

The office door burst open.

Melanie Vance and Scarlett Ashcroft stood frozen in the doorway, faces draining of color.

"You..." Melanie's voice shook with fury. "This is a workplace, not a hotel!"

Derek slowly withdrew his hand, his gaze lingering on Scarlett's exquisite features.

"Agent Vance," he said coldly, "Is this how you teach your artists to barge into executives' offices unannounced?"

Melanie scoffed. "My apologies. I didn't expect to witness such a spectacle in broad daylight."

Derek slammed the desk as he stood. "Watch your tone! Do you want to keep your job or not?"

"Actually, no."

Melanie's contemptuous glance swept over Tiffany's disheveled state.

"Those who climb the casting couch always fall eventually. As for you, Derek—nepotism and embezzlement will ruin this company."

For three years, artists' complaints had snowballed toward headquarters, only to be suppressed.

She knew—once contracts expired, Lowell Entertainment would become an empty shell.

Derek's face darkened dangerously.

"Who the hell do you think you are, Melanie? You dare judge me?"

"I'm here to notify you," Melanie straightened her spine, "I'm resigning. Heading to HR now."

Derek's lips twisted into a vicious smile. "Resign? I'll make sure you never work in this industry again."
###Chapter 143

Liam Valdemar learned to ski with astonishing speed. Though young, he possessed remarkable natural talent.

Falling was nothing unusual for him. Each time, he'd quickly pick himself up and continue practicing.

Ethan Valdemar stood by the rink, his gaze never leaving the small figure gliding across the ice.

"Dad, look!" Liam called excitedly, successfully executing a spin.

Ethan's lips curved slightly. "Not bad. Much better than yesterday."

The coach nearby gave a thumbs-up, praising his young student's performance.

The sudden ring of a phone shattered the warm moment.

Nathaniel Woods' name flashed on the screen.

Ethan signaled the coach to watch Liam and stepped aside to answer.

"Ethan, we've got trouble," Nathaniel's tense voice came through.

Ethan kept his eyes on his son skating. "Get to the point."

"Jasmine Keane resurfaced. She posted a video accusing you of unlawful confinement."

Ethan frowned. "Has she lost her mind?"

"Worse. She hinted you have an illegitimate child in the video." Nathaniel lowered his voice. "She didn't name Sophia, but..."

Ethan immediately checked his messages. His mother's terse text read: Come home now.

He took a deep breath. "Book the earliest flight."

Hanging up, Ethan returned to the rink as if nothing happened.

"Liam, time to go."

——

Sophia Laurent was working in her studio when Beatrice Holloway's call interrupted her flow.

"Sophia, have you seen the news?" Beatrice sounded shocked. "Jasmine Keane claims you..."

Sophia clicked the video link Beatrice sent. Jasmine appeared haggard, tearfully making accusations.

The doorbell rang just as she finished watching.

Ethan stood outside with Liam, his expression calm.

But when their eyes met, both recognized the unspoken concern in each other's gaze.

During the ride to the airport, Liam excitedly recounted his skiing adventures while the adults sat silently with their own thoughts.

Once airborne, Sophia excused herself to the restroom. Ethan followed.

In the cramped space, Sophia whispered, "Why would Jasmine do this?"

"No idea." Ethan rubbed his temples. "But she mentioned Liam."

"Your parents—"

"They'd find out eventually." Ethan cut her off. "Just not like this."

——

Reporters swarmed outside the Valdemar estate that night, cameras flashing as Ethan's car pulled in.

"File a police report tomorrow," he told Nathaniel. "Sue Jasmine for defamation."

Nathaniel hesitated. "Ethan, your father—"

Ethan checked his watch. "Two a.m. Negative three degrees Celsius."

Nathaniel looked confused. "What?"

Without explanation, Ethan strode toward the brightly lit mansion.

Inside, Vincent Valdemar's face was frosty, Diana's expression complicated.

"Explain." Vincent's voice could freeze fire.

Ethan knelt before his parents.

"Dad, Mom... this is my fault."
###Chapter 144

Derek Langley slammed his hands on the desk and stood abruptly. "Scarlett, do you have any idea how much the breach fee is?"

His face was livid as he glared at the two women before him.

Tiffany Merouin stood with her arms crossed, a mocking smirk playing on her lips.

"Mr. Langley, where would they get the money to pay the penalty?" she said in a snarky tone. "They're just putting on an act."

She turned to Melanie and Scarlett. "If you know what's good for you, apologize now. Maybe Mr. Langley will show mercy..."

Derek nodded in satisfaction.

"There's still time to make this right."

Melanie scoffed. "Working with people like you disgusts me."

"Exactly," Scarlett said, straightening her posture. "You're the cancer of this company—bullying others and lining your own pockets..."

Her sharp gaze swept over Derek. "I have no idea how someone like you got into this position."

Derek's face flushed red with rage.

"Seems I've been too lenient," he hissed through clenched teeth. "You're really determined to ruin yourselves?"

"Tch."

Melanie didn't bother wasting words. She grabbed Scarlett's hand. "Let's go."

Without a backward glance, the two strode toward the exit.

Derek and Tiffany exchanged a look before hurrying after them.

In the HR department, the director immediately approached Derek.

"Mr. Langley, what brings you here?"

Tiffany pointed triumphantly at Melanie and Scarlett. "They want to terminate their contracts. Show them the paperwork."

She sneered. "Let them see the reality."

The HR director looked at Melanie in surprise.

As a long-time employee, she understood Melanie's predicament but was powerless to help.

"You... really want to terminate?" she asked hesitantly.

Scarlett's breach fee was no small amount.

Melanie nodded firmly. "Yes."

The HR director's expression turned grave as she retrieved the contract.
###Chapter 145

"The breach fee is 11.2 million. How do you plan to pay?"

The HR manager adjusted her glasses with professional detachment.

Scarlett stepped forward calmly.

"I've scheduled a bank transfer. Please provide the company account."

Her voice was crisp and resolute.

The HR manager quickly sent her the banking details.

Every eye in the office fixed on Scarlett.

Derek's brow furrowed, his palms slick with sweat.

He couldn't let her walk away.

This stubborn woman had endured years of corporate pressure without breaking.

What drove him mad was Scarlett's exquisite features and perfect figure.

Countless investors had requested her presence at dinners.

If not for Melanie's protection, he would've claimed her long ago.

As Scarlett prepared to transfer the funds, Derek forced a smile.

"Scarlett, think carefully."

He feigned concern. "Leaving Lowell Entertainment will ruin your acting career."

"I can transfer you to Tiffany's team with guaranteed resources."

Scarlett recoiled in disgust.

"That won't be necessary. The money is transferring now."

Derek's smile froze.

"Don't be ungrateful!"

He hissed through clenched teeth. "Walk out that door, and I'll blacklist you in this industry."

Scarlett gave an icy laugh.

"Save your disgusting stares."

Her voice dripped venom. "You make me physically ill."

The mask finally slipped.

"You bitch!"

He snarled. "You could've had everything if you'd just obeyed!"

Scarlett suddenly doubled over.

"Ugh—"

Undigested food splattered across Derek's designer suit.

His face turned puce.

"Mr. Langley, the payment cleared."

The HR manager interjected smoothly.

She slid the termination contract forward, flashing Scarlett a discreet wink.
###Chapter 146

Melanie immediately understood. Her fingers trembled slightly as she took the termination contract.

"Thank you."

Without waiting for Derek's reaction, she grabbed Scarlett and bolted toward the elevators.

The glass doors slid shut just as Derek's roar erupted from the conference room.

"This is mutiny!"

He kicked over a chair and charged into the hallway, bellowing at the elevator. "Scarlett! Melanie! I'll make sure you never work in this industry again!"

Employees on the entire floor flinched.

Melanie laughed.

Five years.

That predatory contract had coiled around their necks like a venomous snake, making every breath painful.

Now they'd finally broken free. Even the stale garage air tasted sweet.

Scarlett wiped the corner of her lips, her eyes gleaming with long-lost light.

"Mel, we're free."

"Yes." Melanie clenched the contract. "Time to show them how high we can soar without chains."

The elevator numbers crawled downward.

Service elevators were always agonizingly slow.

Ding—

The garage lights glared harshly.

Julian leaned against his Bentley, exhaling smoke with a sinister smirk.

"Finally bought your freedom?"

He crushed his cigarette and reached for Scarlett's chin. She slapped his hand away.

"Back off."

She stepped aside like avoiding rotting trash.

"Playing hard to get?" Julian sneered. "If you hadn't been such a frigid tease, I wouldn't have needed Vanessa."

The overhead lights flickered.

Scarlett's lips curled in the erratic glow.

"Get your kidneys checked." She slowly pulled out a sanitizing wipe. "Erectile dysfunction requires medical attention."

Julian's face darkened.

"You bitch!" He seized her wrist. "Think your new sugar daddy can—"

His threat died mid-sentence.

Melanie's stiletto hovered at his crotch.

"Let go." She twisted her heel. "Or I'll neuter you."
###Chapter 147

"Stop pretending to be virtuous. You always shy away from physical contact, yet you've sold yourself behind the scenes."

Julian Lombardi's words cut like a knife.

Scarlett Ashcroft's eyes turned icy.

She scanned her surroundings.

The underground parking lot was dimly lit.

This particular corner happened to be a surveillance blind spot.

A cold smirk curled her lips.

Her fist smashed into Julian's delicate face.

The entertainment industry currently favored the pale, youthful, and slender aesthetic.

Julian epitomized this delicate boyish look.

But no one knew Scarlett had trained in kickboxing for ten years.

"Ah!"

A pained scream echoed through the parking garage.

Scarlett finally released the pent-up anger in her chest.

Her fists rained down like hailstones.

Abdomen. Chest. Shoulders.

Each punch avoided vital areas with precision.

But delivered enough agony to make Julian wish for death.

Minutes later.

Julian slumped on the concrete floor.

His handsome face swollen like a pig's head.

Scarlett looked down at him with contempt.

"Cross me again, and it'll be worse next time."

She turned to Melanie Vance, who stood frozen. "Let's go."

Melanie snapped out of her daze.

They quickly got into the car and drove away.

Pearl Entertainment CEO's office.

Sophia Laurent raised an eyebrow. "That was fast."

"Good opportunities shouldn't be delayed."

Scarlett gestured. "This is my agent, Melanie Vance."

Sophia studied Melanie.

Her short, practical haircut and sharp gaze.

"Hello."

Melanie wiped her sweaty palms. "Ms. Laurent."

Sophia handed over a script.

"I'm impressed by Scarlett's presence and acting skills."

"Training starts tomorrow. Screen test in one week."

Melanie accepted the script.

The gilded title "Empress" gleamed up at her.

She gasped.

This was the hottest IP right now.

Online forums buzzed with comparisons to "Imperial Feast."

Melanie's hands trembled slightly.

She never expected their first project to be this caliber.
###Chapter 148

Melanie's fingers trembled slightly as the script rustled in her grasp.

"President Laurent... which role is Scarlett auditioning for?"

She immediately noticed the shift in Sophia's demeanor, from the way she addressed her to her commanding presence.

Sophia's lips curved slightly at the title, offering no correction.

"The female lead. Xiao Yuezhen."

Melanie's pupils constricted. "The... female lead?"

She had expected, at most, a supporting role opportunity.

After all, Scarlett was still a newcomer.

For a moment, she wondered if she'd misheard.

Sophia chuckled, her gaze unwavering.

"Exactly. The female lead."

She hadn't invested heavily in recruiting talent just to cultivate extras.

Returns were expected from her investments.

Melanie and Scarlett exchanged glances, mutual astonishment reflected in their eyes.

After a brief silence, Melanie drew a deep breath.

"Understood. We'll prepare immediately."

Sophia gave a slight nod. "The studio has already made arrangements."

In the underground parking garage, Julian Lombardi leaned heavily against the wall, unable to straighten up.

His hands shook as he dialed his assistant's number.

When the assistant arrived, the sight before him made him gasp.

"Mr. Lombardi, what happened—"

"Shut up... damn it..."

Speaking sent sharp pain through Julian's injuries.

"Just take me to the hospital."

The assistant didn't dare ask further questions and hurried to bring the car around.

In the hospital corridor, the assistant finally got a clear look at Julian's battered state.

"My God! Who did this to you?"

Julian wordlessly pulled a face mask over his bruised features.

After the examination, the doctor adjusted his glasses.

"Mr. Lombardi, these are only minor injuries. They don't meet the standard for legal assault charges."

Julian's head snapped up. "What did you say?"

"The results are conclusive."

The doctor handed him the report calmly. "You're welcome to seek a second opinion elsewhere."

Frustrated, Julian visited three different hospitals.

All delivered the same verdict.

Clenching his fists, he had no choice but to accept it.
###Chapter 149

Julian Lombardi kicked the flowerbed edge in fury, staggering backward from the excessive force.

His assistant swiftly steadied his swaying figure.

A phone ringtone pierced the silent parking lot with jarring abruptness.

Julian ignored it, letting the sound fade into the air unanswered.

The assistant's phone vibrated next.

"It's Tiffany," the assistant murmured in warning.

Julian inhaled deeply before answering with practiced warmth. "Tiffany, I missed your call in the car earlier."

Tiffany Merouin's weary voice carried through the line.

"The 'River Banquet' premiere is tomorrow. Richard is personally invested—you must be punctual."

A pause. "Wear the custom-tailored suit."

Julian's fingers tightened imperceptibly.

This role had fallen into his lap only after Christopher Lowell's scandalous exit.

'River Banquet' was Lowell Entertainment's crown jewel this year, with screenplay rights alone costing tens of millions.

Richard Lowell had originally intended to showcase his own children through this production. Now he was left scrambling for replacements.

"Tiffany..." Julian's Adam's apple bobbed. "About tomorrow's premiere, I might—"

"Julian Lombardi!" Tiffany's voice sharpened. "Do you know how many actors are salivating for this role?"

Her tone turned steely. "Richard's in no mood for nonsense. Don't make things harder for yourself."

Julian stared at the distant neon lights, recalling the whispers overheard on set today.

Some said he'd merely scavenged Christopher's discarded part.

Others placed bets on him being replaced within three months.

"Understood," he finally conceded, voice low.

The moment the call ended, Julian hurled his phone against the pavement.

The screen shattered like his fractured pride.

The assistant wordlessly retrieved the broken device.

Everyone knew what 'River Banquet' meant to Lowell Entertainment.

A five-hundred-million investment, seventy percent funded from company coffers.

Richard couldn't afford to fail. Neither could Julian.

"Prepare tomorrow's outfit," Julian massaged his temples.

He needed to regain composure.

In this industry, opportunities vanished like morning mist.

Christopher's disgrace served as a stark warning.
###Chapter 150

Tiffany Merouin trembled with rage.

"Do you have any idea how much effort I put into securing this role for you?"

"The male lead missing the premiere ceremony? Are you deliberately trying to humiliate Director Richard?"

Julian Lombardi felt utterly miserable under her verbal assault.

Regret churned in his gut.

He never should have gone after Scarlett.

He'd been desperate, chasing her to the parking lot like a fool.

That woman fought dirty.

She showed no mercy, attacking him without hesitation.

The most ridiculous part? The hospital report classified his injuries as minor.

Now he couldn't even press charges against her.

"Julian Lombardi!"

Tiffany's voice turned shrill. "If you don't want this role, the company has plenty of actors lining up—"

Julian forced an apologetic smile. "You misunderstand, Tiffany. I'd never squander this opportunity. I'll be there tomorrow without fail."

He had no choice but to tough it out.

Tiffany's tone softened slightly.

If Julian weren't so adept at playing the game, she wouldn't bother with him.

The moment the call ended, Julian's expression darkened.

"Tell the makeup artist to arrive two hours early tomorrow," he ordered his assistant coldly.

Scarlett had targeted every surveillance blind spot.

That woman fought like a demon.

But damn if she wasn't thrilling.

Too bad she'd rejected all his previous advances, playing the virtuous maiden.

Now she'd probably latched onto some sugar daddy to buy her freedom from Lowell Entertainment.

Just wait until he won Best Actor for "River Banquet." Then Scarlett would regret everything.

Julian couldn't fathom why Scarlett preferred greasy investors over him.

The makeup artist arrived before dawn.

She recoiled at the sight of Julian.

Dark purple bruises circled both eyes. His lips were grotesquely swollen.

Julian stormed to the bathroom.

The distorted reflection made him curse violently.

The makeup artist scrambled for ice packs.

"Apply these immediately. Maybe we can reduce the swelling."

At the "River Banquet" premiere, Richard Lowell commanded attention in his traditional attire.

Since "Lone Mountain's" success, his industry stature had skyrocketed.

"River Banquet" generated buzz long before filming began.
###Chapter 151

Camera flashes lit up the venue as live streams captured the premiere ceremony of "River Banquet."

Richard Lowell stood at the center of the red carpet in a charcoal gray suit.

To his left stood the female lead, Emily Lowell, and to his right, the male lead, Julian Lombardi.

Emily shimmered in a silver mermaid gown, her sapphire necklace glinting under the lights.

She tilted her head slightly, showcasing her flawless profile.

Julian wore a black face mask, revealing only his piercing eyes.

"Director Lowell, what are your thoughts on Gavin Croix's new work 'Empress'?"

A female reporter fired the first sharp question.

Richard adjusted his cufflinks with practiced ease.

"Gavin is an excellent writer. I look forward to his new project."

"But the industry is comparing 'Empress' to 'River Banquet'..."

"Healthy competition drives the film industry forward."

A polite smile played on Richard's lips.

Emily chimed in smoothly, "I believe my father's work will stand above the rest."

Applause rippled through the crowd.

"Director Lowell, about Christopher..."

Staff moved to intervene, but Richard waved them off.

His expression darkened as he faced the cameras.

"As a father, I'm heartbroken."

"The law will deliver justice."

Live comments flooded the stream.

So noble! It's not even his fault!

Sophia Laurent is the real villain—betraying her own brother!

"What about your relationship with Sophia..."

Richard's eyes dimmed.

"Perhaps... she was never meant to be a Lowell."

The remark ignited a social media storm.

Viewers spammed the chat with sympathy.

Ungrateful wretch!

"Empress" will flop—just wait and see!

At the edge of the carpet, flashes illuminated Richard's weary yet resolute face.

He bowed deeply to the cameras.

"Please focus your attention on 'River Banquet.'"

The gesture earned another round of cheers.

No one noticed Julian's clenched fist in the shadows.

Behind his mask, his lips curled into a cold smirk.
###Chapter 152

Richard Lowell's pained expression made many netizens point fingers at Sophia Laurent.

But Sophia and Lucas Sheridan's fans immediately came to her defense.

Artistic family? Exceptional talents? What a joke!

Nathan Lowell's hit song only went viral because Sophia revised the score. He's just an average composer.

Christopher Lowell is even more laughable—his terrible acting is unwatchable. He only got famous through good scripts and character designs, without winning a single industry award.

"Lone Mountain" was decent, but Director Lowell's treatment of his own daughter is disgraceful!

Stop arguing. Let the box office numbers speak when the film releases!

Live stream comments flooded the screen.

Tension crackled in the air at the venue.

"Director Lowell, aren't you worried about hurting Sophia's feelings?"

Richard wore a sorrowful mask. "She never considered us family. Why would she care?"

A reporter in a white shirt suddenly shouted:

"If she didn't consider you family, why did she edit Nathan's music scores? Why did she plan Christopher's career path? She even negotiated the script for 'Lone Mountain' with Gavin Croix! Not to mention Victoria Lowell spent nine million from her credit card over three years!"

Several people in the audience paled.

Watching the live stream, Sophia arched a brow at Oliver Granger. "Your doing?"

Oliver nodded. "Mine."

His eyes remained fixed on Richard's hypocritical display, lips curling in disgust.

"I can't stand that old man's theatrics..."

He then glanced nervously at Sophia. "You're not... reconsidering, are you?"

"Reconsidering?"

Sophia laughed softly. "What kind of joke is that?"

Richard hadn't hesitated to hire internet trolls to smear her.

"Good."

Oliver exhaled in relief. "That whole family is rotten."

On screen, Richard's face darkened.

"Nonsense!"

He barked, "Who let this troublemaker in? Security!"

Though he denied the allegations, netizens had already latched onto the revelations.

Every accusation was verifiable.

The reporter's words jogged public memory.

Sophia got the short end of the stick!

I work at Lowell Entertainment. Everything the reporter said is true—Christopher's career was entirely Sophia's doing.

So they just used her as an ATM?

Security quickly dragged the reporter away.

A staff member hurriedly intervened: "This is the launch event for 'River Banquet.' Please refrain from irrelevant questions. Legal action will be taken against today's disruptor."
###Chapter 153
The Secret Behind the Mask

The press conference atmosphere froze instantly.

Director Richard Lowell's response clearly failed to satisfy the reporters' curiosity.

"Mr. Lombardi, could you share your personal interpretation of this role?" A female journalist suddenly raised her voice.

All cameras immediately swiveled toward Julian Lombardi.

Live comments exploded across streaming platforms.

"That eyeliner is way too thick."
"His eyes look swollen like walnuts."
"Did his plastic surgery go wrong?"

Richard remained oblivious to the murmurs.

He turned to Julian with a gentle tone. "Julian, say hello to everyone."

Julian's fingers tightened unconsciously around the microphone.

"Apologies, I'm fighting a cold..." His muffled voice filtered through the mask.

Richard's brow creased almost imperceptibly.

"Just a few words will suffice."

Standing nearby, Tiffany Merouin chimed in cheerfully. "Come on, Julian. Don't be shy."

Sweat drenched Julian's back.

He forced himself to speak. "It's an honor to portray this character..."

Before he could finish, Tiffany's hand shot out.

"Why are you hiding your face?"

Her movement was too swift to intercept.

The mask ripped away violently.

Complete silence engulfed the room.

Julian's grotesquely swollen face lay fully exposed under the relentless camera flashes.
###Chapter 154

Julian Lombardi's face caused an uproar in the venue.

Everyone stared at the stage with shocked expressions.

Was that exaggerated makeup?

His swollen cheeks caked with thick foundation looked like a mask.

This is the male lead of "River Banquet"?

The comment section exploded instantly.

Did he have a botched plastic surgery?

The casting director must be blind!

If this is how he looks in the actual show, I'm dropping it!

Julian's fans immediately jumped to his defense.

Our idol must be injured!

Have you no sympathy?

He's still working despite his condition. My heart aches!

Who did this to him?

Tiffany Merouin stood beside Julian, her face pale.

"Jul... Julian, your face..."

He forced a smile.

"I took a fall in the underground parking lot last night. Sorry for worrying everyone."

"Underground parking?"

Tiffany suddenly raised her voice. "Was it Melanie and Scarlett—"

Julian cut her off sharply.

"Tiffany!"

He gritted his teeth discreetly.

This stupid woman had to mention Scarlett now?

Tiffany caught herself and laughed awkwardly.

"Just a wild guess. Let's get you checked at the hospital later."

Richard Lowell stood nearby, his expression stormy.

His stomach churned looking at Julian's disastrous face.

That leading role should have been his son's.

All thanks to that ungrateful daughter!

Now this joke of an opening ceremony.

He shot Tiffany a venomous glare.

If not for her meddling, things wouldn't be this embarrassing.

Emily Lowell gracefully stepped forward to diffuse the tension.

"Everyone should be careful in underground parking lots."

Her haute couture gown shimmered with museum-worthy jewelry.

"Minor injuries heal quickly. This won't affect filming."

Fans instantly shifted their attention.

Emily is so thoughtful!

That jewelry set costs eight figures!

Only the Lowell heiress carries such elegance!
###Chapter 155

Emily Lowell stood obediently beside Richard Lowell, gently massaging his shoulders.

"Father, don't be angry. Sophia just has a straightforward personality."

Her voice was soft, like a spring breeze skimming the lake.

Richard gazed at his adopted daughter with warmth in his eyes.

"You're the sensible one."

The surrounding staff exchanged approving glances.

"Director Lowell is truly blessed to have such a caring daughter."

"Indeed, she's far better than that troublemaker Sophia."

Emily lowered her head modestly, though the corners of her lips curled slightly upward.

Though the commotion at the opening ceremony had settled, online discussions only grew fiercer.

Julian Lombardi's fanbase was in an uproar.

"We found out! Scarlett Ashcroft is an artist under Lowell Entertainment!"

"She was involved in a scandal last year—caught cheating red-handed."

"How dare someone like her get close to our idol?"

Fans feverishly dug up dirt on Scarlett and Melanie Vance.

But the trail soon went cold.

"Strange... The three of them seem to have no connection at all."

Meanwhile, Scarlett was drenched in sweat inside the rehearsal studio.

She practiced her expressions repeatedly before the mirror.

"Again."

Sophia Laurent sat nearby, lightly tapping the script with her fingers.

"For Empress Xiao Yue's coronation scene, your gaze needs more ferocity."

Scarlett nodded, taking a deep breath.

The woman in the mirror suddenly sharpened her eyes.

A week later, at the "Empress" audition venue.

Director Lucas Sheridan flipped through documents when his eyes suddenly lit up.

"Sophia!"

He strode forward eagerly, though his gaze remained fixed on Scarlett.

"Is this the actress you mentioned?"

Sophia smiled faintly.

"Shall we let her try?"

Lucas nodded impatiently.

"Start now!"

The audition room door slowly closed.

Scarlett took a deep breath and stepped toward her chance to change her destiny.
###Chapter 156

The audition room fell into complete silence. All eyes were fixed on the center of the stage. This scene depicted the pivotal moment when Princess Xiao Yuezhen, upon learning of her brother's assassination, made the earth-shattering decision to disguise herself as a man and inherit the throne.

Director Lucas Sheridan called "Action," and Scarlett Ashcroft's expression transformed instantly.

The Xiao imperial lineage had dwindled to only two heirs - the twin siblings Xiao Yuezhen and Xiao Yueqi. With the empress deceased and the emperor on his deathbed, the ambitious feudal lords finally launched their rebellion.

As rebel forces stormed the palace, the dying emperor used his last breath to name Crown Prince Xiao Yueqi as his successor.

But assassins sent by the feudal lords had already infiltrated the palace. Xiao Yueqi was murdered the night before his coronation. The news plunged the entire palace into despair.

The crown princess clung to her husband's lifeless body, weeping inconsolably. Her eyes burned with resolve as she drew a sword to join him in death. Maids and eunuchs knelt nearby, wailing as if witnessing the end of the Xiao dynasty.

Xiao Yuezhen stood frozen until the blade nearly touched the crown princess's throat. Then she sprang into action.

"Stop, sister-in-law!"

The sword clattered to the ground.

Xiao Yuezhen surveyed the room with commanding presence. "Stay calm," she ordered firmly.

She instructed her maids to fetch her brother's imperial robes and personally prepared his body. Then she donned male attire and had her maids adjust her features.

The twins had always resembled each other. With careful makeup, Xiao Yuezhen became the spitting image of Xiao Yueqi. She padded her boots to add height, straightened her posture, and lowered her voice.

When "Xiao Yueqi" reappeared, even the crown princess faltered in recognition.

"Attend me in the throne hall."

Xiao Yuezhen's piercing gaze and authoritative tone rallied the courtiers. They straightened their backs, their spirits lifting.

The scene's greatest challenge lay in portraying Xiao Yuezhen's simultaneous fear and fortitude. Though raised as a sheltered princess, she had trained in martial arts and scholarship since childhood - now she must summon every ounce of that training.

Director Sheridan had auditioned dozens of actresses. Younger stars could only portray panic, while veteran actresses were too old for the role. Not until Scarlett appeared did he find his true Xiao Yuezhen.
###Chapter 157

Lucas Sheridan had already made up his mind.

The role in "Empress" demanded an actor with commanding presence. Those delicate, inexperienced actresses could never handle such a character.

But when Scarlett Winslow stepped onto the audition stage, Lucas's eyes instantly lit up.

Scarlett's striking beauty carried an undeniable aura of strength.

Without any costume changes, she flawlessly portrayed both Princess Xiaoyue and Crown Prince Yueqi through sheer expression alone.

Her seamless transition from a panicked princess to an authoritative heir apparent was mesmerizing.

"Sophia, where did you find this girl?" Lucas whispered excitedly to Sophia Laurent.

Such acting prowess stood head and shoulders above her peers.

Sophia watched the stage with satisfaction. "What do you think, Director Sheridan?"

"Brilliant!" Lucas gave a thumbs-up. "Tell her to wait for our call."

Though final casting decisions weren't solely his, he felt confident about convincing the investors.

Scarlett's relative obscurity might require some persuasion.

"Let me know if you encounter issues," Sophia said calmly. "Funding won't be a problem."

Lucas's face brightened as he rubbed his hands together. "Then I won't hold back."

These days, investors always interfered - either pushing their favorites or demanding script changes.

With Sophia's backing, he could firmly reject all those nepotism hires.

"Proceed as you see fit." Sophia nodded.

Pearl Entertainment had already committed half the budget.

She believed in the script. She believed in Lucas.

Having studied his previous films, she recognized his masterful cinematography, though weak scripts and casting had undermined them.

That failure had driven him from features to variety shows.

For years he'd longed to return to filmmaking, hindered by both lack of worthy projects and personal demons.

Now he was determined to prove himself.

He practically lived on set, obsessed with perfecting this production.

Especially to surpass that Richard Lowell.

So-called venerable director? Just a hypocrite in Lucas's eyes.

The next day, "Empress" officially announced its cast.

@EmpressOfficial: Witness the rise of a sovereign. A woman's iron will forging an empire.

Starring: @ScarlettWinslow

Co-starring: @GregoryThornfield @LeonardGraves...

With "River Banquet" having revealed its lineup earlier, netizens eagerly awaited "Empress"'s casting news.

The announcement sent shockwaves across social media.
###Chapter 158

The official announcement of "Empress" exploded across trending lists.

Netizens exchanged bewildered glances at the cast list.

Director Lucas Sheridan's new project, adapted from Gavin Croix's bestselling novel "Lone Mountain," boasted an impressive lineup.

But the female lead's name, Scarlett Ashcroft, left everyone scratching their heads.

"Who is Scarlett Ashcroft? Never heard of her."

"Two award-winning actors playing second fiddle to a nobody? Ridiculous!"

"Another industry plant shoved in by connections?"

The comment section erupted instantly.

Someone dug up Scarlett's social media accounts.

Her old background actor promotions from Lowell Entertainment days became ammunition for haters.

Emily Lowell's fans were the first to mock.

"Laughable. Emily starred in 'River Banquet,' while this extra gets 'Empress'?"

"Has Director Sheridan lost his mind?"

Even "Lone Mountain" book fans wavered.

"Sheridan's casting is usually flawless. What happened this time?"

"Can a rookie carry an epic female-led drama?"

The backlash was nearly unanimous.

Only Sheridan's loyal fans held firm.

"Trust the director's vision."

"Scarlett has striking screen presence."

As controversy peaked, the official "Empress" account released the first character still.

Scarlett stood center frame in obsidian imperial robes.

Her piercing gaze beneath the beaded crown radiated chilling authority.

An aura of sovereignty emanated from her.

To her left, Leonard Arnault in white scholar robes.

His gentle chancellor portrayal leapt off the screen.

To her right, Gregory Eisner in black battle armor.

The general's lethal intensity was palpable.

The moment this still dropped.

The internet gasped.

All criticism ceased abruptly.

Replaced by an avalanche of awe.
###Chapter 159

Scarlett Ashcroft's character stills have stunned the entire internet! Her presence is absolutely breathtaking!

Oh my god! These character stills of Scarlett are beyond perfection!

From this day forward, I officially declare myself a devoted fan of Scarlett's beauty!

That piercing gaze is lethal! She's the epitome of a formidable empress!

Emily Lowell's character stills pale in comparison to Scarlett's, don't they?

The production team of "River Banquet" recently released Emily's character stills.

She wore a crimson palace gown adorned with elaborate hair ornaments.

At first glance, she looked stunning.

But placed beside Scarlett, she instantly appeared trivial and insignificant.

The character stills for "Empress" are simply in a league of their own!

Scarlett stands regal in an obsidian dragon robe.

With one hand behind her back, her eyes blaze with authority.

That commanding aura makes her seem like an empress who's stepped right out of history!

The comment section has exploded.

"Now this is the presence a true female lead should have!"

"Is Emily's delicate flower look meant for a harem drama?"

"Julian Lombardi's prince costume is downright pathetic."

"Those scrawny arms and legs could never survive a battlefield!"

"River Banquet" boasts itself as a grand production.

It tells the story of a time-traveling woman helping a mediocre prince seize the throne.

The female lead is supposedly a brilliant general's daughter with both brains and bravery.

But Emily's fragile appearance shows no trace of a warrior's spirit.

Meanwhile, Scarlett...

Her character stills alone convince audiences she's a legendary empress.

Julian Lombardi nearly smashed his phone when he saw the trending topic.

He glared at Scarlett's photos.

How dare she land the lead role in "Empress"?

She was supposed to remain beneath his feet forever.

Julian's chest heaved violently.

A sense of uncontrollable panic gripped him.

Scarlett had risen to stand equal with him.

This couldn't be allowed!

He must find a way to destroy her.
###Chapter 160

Julian Lombardi's knuckles turned white as he gripped his phone.

The lead role in "River Banquet" should have been Christopher Lowell's prize. Yet now it rested in his hands.

But his triumph was short-lived.

The announcement of "Empress" casting Scarlett Ashcroft as the female lead felt like a slap across his face.

Scarlett?

That nobody who wasn't even D-list?

He hurled his phone onto the sofa.

Meanwhile, in the CEO's office at Lowell Entertainment...

Derek Langley stared at his computer screen, his expression stormy.

"Investigate. Find out who's backing Scarlett Ashcroft."

Tiffany Merouin stormed in on stiletto heels, slamming a stack of documents onto his desk.

"That bitch Melanie Vance! She actually managed to hitch Scarlett to a rising star!"

Her nails dug into her palms.

Years ago, she'd schemed tirelessly to crush Melanie. Now the woman was making a comeback?

A chill ran down Tiffany's spine.

No one understood Melanie's capabilities better than her. If not for years of systematic suppression...

"No!" She shot to her feet. "I won't let her rise again!"

Top floor of Pearl Group.

Scarlett Ashcroft practiced facial expressions before a mirror, sweat trickling down her cheeks.

With "Empress" filming imminent, she couldn't waste this opportunity.

In the adjacent conference room, Sophia Laurent reviewed talent profiles Melanie had submitted.

"These are promising candidates." Melanie pointed at the photos. "Unknown now, but I've been observing them..."

Sophia closed the folder.

"Sign them all."

Melanie blinked.

"Madam Laurent, don't you want to—"

Sophia met her gaze. "From today, Pearl Entertainment is under your complete authority."

Melanie's eyes reddened.

She drew a steadying breath. "I won't fail you."

Sophia nodded.

She'd already noticed most talents came from Lowell Entertainment.

She wondered what expressions the Lowells would wear when these "discards" shone under Pearl's banner.

Her phone rang.

The receptionist spoke cautiously. "Madam Laurent, a woman claiming to be your mother—"

Sophia's gaze turned glacial.

"Send her up."
###Chapter 161

Sophia Laurent had no intention of seeing the Lowells.

But that nine-million-dollar IOU was still in her possession.

With the court date approaching, Victoria Lowell's sudden visit spoke volumes.

When the office door opened, Sophia didn't even look up.

"Sophia..."

Victoria stood alone in the doorway, her gaze shifting nervously.

Sophia closed the file and tapped her fingers lightly on the desk. "Do you have the money?"

The question instantly darkened Victoria's expression.

"Are you that desperate for cash?" Victoria clutched her handbag. "Do you really think the Lowells would default?"

Sophia chuckled.

"So you managed to scrape it together." She twirled a pen between her fingers. "Let me guess—Richard didn't give you a cent."

Victoria stiffened.

"And your precious sons..." Sophia drawled. "Did they even pick up your calls?"

The pen clattered onto the desk.

"Was it Emily who helped you?"

Victoria's lips trembled. "Emily has more decency than you!"

"True." Sophia nodded. "Anyone can be generous with someone else's money."

The words cut deep.

A check was slammed onto the desk.

"Take your damn money!"

Sophia examined it carefully before tossing it into a drawer.

"I'll handle the court matter." She reopened the file. "Goodbye."

The only sound left was the rustling of papers.

Victoria stood rooted in place, her nails digging into her palms.

"Must you make this so ugly?" she burst out. "The Valdemars are in crisis, and you—"

"Are you finished?"

Sophia lifted her gaze, her dark eyes glacial.

"Shall I call security to escort you out?"
###Chapter 162

Victoria Lowell sighed deeply, her face etched with worry.

"Families like the Valdemars value their reputation above all. Aren't you afraid they'll grow tired of your antics?"

Sophia Laurent curled her lips into a cold smile at the feigned concern.

"Mrs. Lowell, have you forgotten the real reason the Valdemars married me? What do I have to fear?"

The biting sarcasm in her voice made Victoria's expression darken.

"You're just bitter about being forced into this marriage."

"Wrong."

Sophia's crimson lips curved upward. "I was eager to marry into the Valdemars."

If not for being coerced into that healing marriage, she might never have seen through her family's true nature.

All her life, she'd yearned for their love.

Despite repeated disappointments, she couldn't sever those blood ties.

But the arranged marriage shattered her illusions completely.

Fortunately, the Valdemars treated her well.

Now she lived comfortably.

No more cleaning up Lowell Entertainment's messes.

No more exhausting herself for her family's showbiz ambitions.

No more handing over her creative works to Richard Lowell.

Victoria studied Sophia's serene expression, her frown deepening.

They'd assumed Sophia's erratic behavior stemmed from resisting the marriage.

Now she was utterly confused.

"If you were willing, why sabotage us at every turn?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Who exactly have I sabotaged?"

Victoria faltered under her daughter's unflinching gaze.

After a long pause, she hissed:

"You stole Lowell Entertainment's contracts, leaving William scrambling."

"Nathan's music career was finally taking off, and you destroyed it."

"Then there's Christopher - just some property damage, yet you had him arrested."

Her voice rose with each accusation.

She wanted to demand why Sophia had canceled that $9 million check from Emily.

But remembering her daughter's ruthlessness, she swallowed the words.

Sophia actually laughed at the litany of complaints.

"Business is war. Pearl Group won those contracts fair and square."

She leaned back lazily in her chair.

"Nathan built his career plagiarizing my work, then bit the hand that fed him. Why should I help him?"

"As for Christopher, he got what he deserved."

Victoria trembled with rage.

"They're your brothers! How can you be so heartless?"
###Chapter 163

Sophia Laurent's eyes frosted over. "Brother? He doesn't deserve that title."

Victoria Lowell's pained expression only filled her with bitter amusement.

"The man who slapped me for Emily's sake, the one who threw my art supplies in the trash, the person who publicly accused me of cheating—he dares call himself my brother?"

Victoria's brows knitted tightly. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

"Anyone from my school could tell you what Emily did back then." Sophia tapped the desk lightly with her fingertips. "But it doesn't matter whether you investigate now or not."

"You've lost your mind!" Victoria trembled with anger. "Emily would never—"

Sophia suddenly laughed. "Isn't Nathan looking into this? Why don't you ask him?"

Victoria's pupils constricted sharply.

Could it be... true?

She forced herself to calm down, remembering her purpose for coming.

"Sophia, the Valdemar family is in a delicate situation. You must be cautious. Alienating your family won't do you any good. When you face difficulties—"

Sophia picked up a file. "Are you done? The door's that way."

"You—!" Victoria took two urgent steps forward. "I heard you invested in Lucas Sheridan's film? Do you have any idea what position your father holds in the industry? Must you oppose him at every turn?"

She lowered her voice. "That money would be better spent developing your company. Merging Pearl Group with Lowell Entertainment would give you leverage in the Valdemar family—"

Sophia's pen stilled.

So this was their real goal.

"Have you had a medical checkup recently?" Sophia asked sincerely. "I recommend a brain scan."

Victoria's face paled.

"You'll regret this! When 'Empress' flops and you lose everything—"

Sophia chuckled.

Where did they get such confidence? 'Empress' had already trended three times just from Scarlett Winslow's character stills.

As Victoria stormed out, slamming the door, Sophia was reviewing the latest report—'Empress' had already surpassed 100 million in presale tickets.
###Chapter 164

Richard Lowell stared at the computer screen, his face dark with fury.

He had been waiting to see the "Empress" production team humiliated.

In his eyes, Lucas Sheridan was just a variety show director who knew nothing about filmmaking.

But the moment the character stills for "Empress" were released, the internet erupted in excitement.

The lead actress, Scarlett Ashcroft, stood in a striking red gown, her piercing gaze radiating regal authority.

"Isn't Scarlett signed with Lowell Entertainment?" Richard's fingers tapped the desk, his voice icy.

Derek Langley's back was drenched in sweat.

"Mr. Lowell, she... terminated her contract recently."

"Terminated?" Richard slammed his palm on the desk. "Who authorized that?"

Beads of sweat formed on Derek's forehead.

"Someone... paid the breach fee for her."

Richard's eyes flashed with rage.

"Sophia Laurent!"

He gritted his teeth. "She's determined to oppose me at every turn, isn't she?"

The office atmosphere grew suffocating.

After a long silence, Richard let out a cold laugh.

"Dig up dirt on Scarlett."

"Hire internet trolls to muddy the waters."

He wouldn't allow "Empress" to proceed smoothly.

And he certainly wouldn't let Sophia profit from her investment.

Derek nodded frantically before hastily exiting.

Lucas Sheridan was completely immersed in filming.

The moment the opening ceremony concluded, he threw himself into the intense production schedule.

Scarlett's performance exceeded all expectations.

Her eyes held the intensity of a battlefield.

Every subtle expression was executed flawlessly.

Veteran actors Gregory Eisner and Leonard Arnault delivered masterful performances.

When the three shared a scene, even the crew held their breath.

Watching the footage on the monitor, Lucas couldn't suppress a smile.

Sophia had truly gifted him a treasure.
###Chapter 165

The film set blazed with lights.

Scarlett Ashcroft stood between two veteran actors, her gaze sharp as a blade.

"I'm innocent!" Her line delivery echoed through the silent studio.

Director Lucas Sheridan clenched his fists behind the monitor.

This scene was perfection.

Scarlett's presence completely overshadowed the seasoned actors.

Lucas excitedly flipped through the script, already planning the next shot.

Meanwhile, Twitter exploded.

#ScarlettAshcroftCastingCouch
#SleepingHerWayToTheTop

The hashtags hit 100 million views instantly.

Blurry photos spread like wildfire online.

In them, Scarlett lay disheveled on a bed beside a pixelated man.

Gossip accounts quickly dissected the details.

"Facial recognition confirms this man is Derek Langley, CEO of Lowell Entertainment!"

Comments flooded in.

"OMG! I can't believe Scarlett would do this!"
"No wonder she landed the lead in 'Empress.'"
"How could she kiss that pig Derek?"

The controversy grew hotter.

Someone started a poll: "Guess Scarlett's next sugar daddy?"

The options listed all married industry heavyweights.

"My money's on Mr. Shaw. He's into this stuff."
"Mr. Summers is more likely. His wife just filed for divorce."

The scandal snowballed.

Scarlett's Twitter comments became a cesspool of vitriol.

Every post drowned in vulgar insults.

Then one timid comment appeared: "Remember when Scarlett's ex cheated on her?"

It vanished beneath the hateful tsunami.
###Chapter 166

Scarlett Ashcroft had spent years navigating the cutthroat entertainment industry.

At eighteen, she signed with Lowell Entertainment. Now, seven years had passed.

Roles were scarce—mostly insignificant supporting parts.

But her expressive eyes always left an impression on audiences.

Then she publicly exposed her cheating boyfriend. After briefly trending, she vanished from the spotlight.

Even minor roles dried up.

Variety shows and endorsements became distant dreams.

Gradually, the world forgot her.

Now, her sudden mention stirred old memories.

"I remember her. That scandal was huge back then."

"The posts disappeared overnight. The video got deleted too."

"Looking back, maybe she was the problem."

"That kind of woman deserves to be dumped."

...

Negative comments flooded in.

The official account of "Empress" faced backlash, with demands to recast.

Lucas Sheridan frowned at his assistant's report.

His gaze drifted to the corner of the set.

Scarlett sat quietly, eating her boxed lunch.

"Don't alert her yet," Lucas said grimly. "Give me her agent's number."

Melanie Vance was negotiating a web series for a new client.

The call nearly made her drop her phone.

"Absolute nonsense!"

"Don't worry, Director Sheridan. I'll handle this," she said rapidly. "Scarlett isn't that kind of person."

Lucas gave a quiet hum.

Finding the perfect lead had been tough.

But the growing scandal threatened the film's success.

Melanie cut the meeting short.

Back at the office, her assistant stopped her. "Sophia Laurent wants to see you."

She hurried to the CEO's office.

"Ms. Laurent?"

Sophia looked up. "Who cheated on Scarlett back then?"

Melanie froze.

She'd prepared defenses for Scarlett's scandals. This question caught her off guard.

"Julian Lombardi," she answered truthfully. "The current heartthrob."
###Chapter 167

Sophia Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the desk and looked up at Melanie Vance. "Julian Lombardi? The charming male lead from River Banquet?"

A cold smirk curled at the corner of her lips.

Richard Lowell had truly kicked a hornet's nest this time.

"Besides the video, is there any other evidence?"

Melanie pulled a USB drive from her bag. "Julian cheated with Vanessa Kalmien, back when they weren't as famous. Scarlett witnessed them together in the apartment..."

Her voice suddenly faltered, her face turning pale.

"We later found their hotel records and plenty of intimate photos."

Sophia took the USB, her brows furrowing.

"Was Scarlett's involvement with Derek Langley consensual?"

Melanie's head snapped up, her eyes reddening.

She hadn't expected Sophia to see through the smear campaign with such clarity.

"No."

Melanie clenched her fists. "Julian got Scarlett drunk and personally delivered her to Derek's room."

Sophia's pupils constricted.

The actor who always played the gentle, considerate lead was nothing but filth behind the scenes.

"But Derek didn't succeed," Melanie quickly added. "Even drunk, Scarlett fought back hard enough to send him to the hospital. She even recorded the whole thing."

She let out a bitter laugh. "But with her contract binding her, the evidence was useless."

Sophia's fingers resumed their rhythmic tapping.

So this was why Scarlett had been trapped under Lowell Entertainment's thumb all this time.

"With solid evidence, this will be easy."

A sharp glint flashed in Sophia's eyes as she smiled.

"Leave it all to me."

It was time to make these scum pay.

After Melanie hurried out, Sophia logged into Pearl Entertainment's official account.

The comments section exploded with vitriol:

"Pearl only collects trash now?"

"Sophia's no saint herself. Now she's signing Scarlett?"

"How dare she promote such a filthy woman? Doesn't she fear karma?"

Sophia smirked coldly and typed swiftly:

"The truth will come out. Who's really filthy here?"

She hit send, her icy gaze fixed on Julian's promotional still on the screen.

The real show was just beginning.
###Chapter 168

Sophia Laurent posted a crucial video on social media.

The trigger for Scarlett Ashcroft's online backlash was a compromising photo.

It showed her disheveled beside Derek Langley, the powerful head of Lowell Entertainment.

As an unknown actress, the image sparked immediate outrage.

Sophia's footage was shaky but clearly captured the incident.

Derek Langley crouched on the floor in his signature burgundy suit.

He clutched his stomach while spewing profanities.

"Scarlett, how dare you hit me? You should be grateful for my attention!"

Scarlett's drunken voice slurred in response.

"You...disgusting...get away!"

Derek suddenly noticed her recording. His face twisted in fury.

"You bitch! Give me that phone!"

The intoxicated actress defiantly held her ground.

"No...way! What...can you do?"

Derek struggled to stand, slowed by pain.

Though heavily drunk, Scarlett instinctively dodged.

At 5'8", she towered over him. She staggered in circles around the room.

The camera shook violently but captured every word.

"Stop playing hard to get! Serve me well and I'll give you all the resources—"

Scarlett hiccuped.

"Who...cares..."

After minutes of chasing, Derek panted and changed tactics.

"Enough games, sweetheart." His oily tone turned stomachs.

"Be mine and I'll make you untouchable in this industry."

He regretted not bringing bodyguards. This fragile-looking girl was unexpectedly stubborn.

Scarlett paused, pointing drunkenly.

"In...your dreams!" Her voice softened with intoxication.

"Gross! You think...being a CEO...matters?"

"I'll...make it...on my own!"

The video ended with crashing sounds and sudden silence.
###Chapter 169

Sophia Laurent's video detonated across the internet like a bomb.

Derek Langley's lecherous behavior was captured in crystal-clear detail.

Scarlett Ashcroft's terrified expression upon waking pierced everyone's hearts.

The comment section erupted.

"Jesus! Derek is disgusting!"

"Scarlett's so brave for recording this!"

"How did this footage survive? Unbelievable!"

Netizens launched immediate investigations.

Someone dug up Scarlett's acting history.

Before that charity gala, she'd been getting minor roles.

Afterwards—five years without a single project.

This was clearly a blacklisting.

Public opinion flipped instantly.

"So Scarlett got blacklisted for refusing to sleep her way up!"

"Hollywood's darkest secret exposed!"

"We've all been fooled!"

Enraged users flooded Derek's social media accounts.

A tidal wave of curses poured in.

Inside Derek's office—

He stared at the damning footage, fingers trembling as he dialed.

"Julian Lombardi! You swore this video was deleted!"

Panicked stammering came through the receiver.

"Mr. Langley, I watched her delete it myself!"

"She was drunk—I even sent you the proof video..."

Derek's face turned ashen.

He'd indeed received deletion confirmation.

No one expected Scarlett to have kept a backup.

"Useless!"

He smashed the phone against his desk.

The PR department's lines were overwhelmed.

The situation was spiraling out of control.

Beads of sweat formed on Derek's forehead.

This firestorm needed extinguishing—fast.
###Chapter 170

The online feud escalated rapidly.

Just as netizens were collectively condemning Derek Langley, a flood of orchestrated posts suddenly emerged.

"Scarlett Ashcroft must have a sugar daddy backing her to terminate her contract so smoothly!"

"She rejected Derek Langley—probably because he wasn't powerful enough for her tastes."

"An obscure D-list actress lands the lead role in 'Empress' out of nowhere? Who would believe there's no shady deal?"

The comments came like a tidal wave, clearly the work of paid trolls. Many netizens were stunned by the blatant manipulation.

"Wow, this is the most pathetic attempt at whitewashing I've ever seen."

"Victim-blaming now? How much did Derek Langley pay for this?"

"Lowell Entertainment never changes—still playing dirty."

Derek Langley smirked as he watched the public opinion shift. He doubled down on deploying trolls, determined to pin all the blame on Scarlett Ashcroft.

"I can't let this fire burn me," he schemed silently. "If my niece gets dragged into this, it's over."

On the set of "River Banquet," Julian Lombardi scrolled through his phone, his face alight with schadenfreude.

"Fools are never in short supply," he sneered. "Let's see how long Scarlett can keep up her holier-than-thou act once her sugar daddy gets exposed."

The online storm continued to brew. When Sophia Laurent stepped into the fray, the controversy reached new heights.

"'Empress' is bankrolled by Pearl Group, and Sophia Laurent is shielding her. Connect the dots, people."

"Pretty sure Sophia climbed the ladder the same way—on her back."

The speculation snowballed, sparking thousands of heated discussions. Some even stormed Pearl Group's official account to demand answers.

Sophia Laurent coldly read the comments before posting her response:

"I poached Scarlett Ashcroft from Lowell Entertainment. Got a problem with that?"

The internet exploded.

"Wait... does that mean...?" Netizens exchanged bewildered glances.
###Chapter 171

Sophia Laurent's fingertips lightly tapped the tablet screen displaying Scarlett Ashcroft's skyrocketing follower count. Five hundred thousand and still climbing.

Lucas Sheridan suddenly updated his Weibo.

He released an exclusive audition tape with a succinct caption: "This is my Empress @ScarlettAshcroft."

In the video, Scarlett stood alone at the center of an empty stage.

She initially stumbled backward in apparent fright, as if evading an unseen threat. Then her gaze sharpened abruptly. Shoulders squared, her trembling fingers reached up to adjust an invisible crown.

"Your Majesty, the court awaits your coronation—"

She pivoted slowly toward the void, her skirt flaring with regal precision. In that moment, the fragile princess transformed completely into a decisive monarch.

The comment section exploded.

"Holy shit! That performance!"
"That turn gave me chills!"
"Director Sheridan's vision is flawless—she IS the Empress!"

Scarlett dominated the top three trending hashtags:
#ScarlettEmpressAudition
#LucasSheridanLeadRole
#ScarlettsActingMasterclass

Sophia refreshed the page with a satisfied smile. Scarlett's followers had surpassed six hundred thousand, climbing visibly by the second.

She picked up the intercom. "Release the prepared statements."

Within thirty minutes, multiple entertainment influencers broke synchronized stories:
"Exclusive: Scarlett's cheating ex was actually..."
"Shocking identity of Scarlett's former lover revealed..."
"Scarlett's leaked recording exposing her toxic ex?"

The online mob shifted focus immediately.

"I knew our queen wouldn't take this lying down!"
"The truth comes out! Waiting for that scumbag's downfall!"
"Scarlett plays no games—straight to the jugular!"

Observing the shifting舆论, Sophia closed her laptop with finality.

Meanwhile, Derek Langley's office descended into chaos.

"Sir, our stocks just crashed!"
"Three partners terminated contracts!"
"The board demands an emergency meeting!"

Derek shattered a teacup against the wall. Glaring at Scarlett's audition footage, he snarled: "Investigate! I want full background on this Scarlett Ashcroft!"
###Chapter 172

Sophia Laurent closely monitored the online discourse.

The buzz around "Empress" and "River Banquet" continued to surge, with Scarlett Ashcroft dominating conversations.

Once the internet trolls joined the fray, public attention swiftly shifted to the cheating scandal.

Julian Lombardi had been gloating over Derek Langley's humiliation on set—until the flames reached him.

Netizens demanded Scarlett release footage exposing the cheater and his mistress. Julian jerked his hand back from a burning cigarette.

He sucked in a sharp breath.

Vanessa Kalmien burst into the dressing room, panic-stricken.

"Julian, have you seen the news?"

"I have." His face darkened.

"Who knew Scarlett could endure five years of abuse at Lowell Entertainment without cracking?" Vanessa seethed. "She was saving it all for this moment."

Her lips twisted. "This is why I said we should've blacklisted her completely. But no—you all insisted her face still had value..."

Julian raked fingers through his hair.

"I need to call Scarlett. We can't let her expose us."

Vanessa nodded frantically. "Do it now. That's exactly what I was thinking."

Neither anticipated Scarlett—once trampled into the mud—could make such a comeback.

On the "Empress" set, Scarlett stood beneath a tree, studying a veteran actor's performance.

These past days had deepened her understanding of the craft.

Her assistant approached with a phone.

"Scarlett, you have a call."

Reluctantly, she tore her gaze away.

Her brow furrowed at the caller ID. After a beat, she stepped aside and answered.

"Scar! Lett! You vicious—"

Julian's voice barely registered before she ended the call. Blocked and deleted in one fluid motion.

He stared at his phone, stunned.

"She hung up on me?!"

Vanessa stomped her foot.

"Julian, Pearl Group backs her now. Force won't work—you need to sweet-talk her..."

Her chest heaved, voice trembling.

"You shared a bond from campus to career. She must still have some sentiment..."

Containing Scarlett was critical.

Julian knew this. His lead role in "River Banquet" was his lifeline—he couldn't lose it.

First, stabilize the situation. There'd be plenty of time to deal with her later.

But when he redialed, a robotic voice answered:

"The number you have reached is not in service..."

His face turned ashen. The phone shattered against the wall.
###Chapter 173

Vanessa Kalmien's face darkened instantly.

She had never been good at hiding her emotions. Without hesitation, she pulled out her phone and dialed Scarlett Ashcroft's number.

Scarlett had just wrapped up a scene. Seeing the caller ID, she frowned slightly.

She knew ignoring this call wouldn't end things easily.

The moment she answered, Vanessa's sickly sweet voice oozed through the line.

"Scarlett, are you still mad at me?"

Scarlett's gaze remained steady as she surveyed the film set.

"If you're sick, go to a hospital. Don't waste my time."

"I know what happened between me and Julian hurt you, but we never meant to—"

Vanessa deliberately pitched her voice higher. "Blame me if you must. Julian is innocent. Can't you just let him go?"

Scarlett let out a cold laugh.

"So you're saying you forced him?"

Vanessa's expression twisted.

Suppressing her anger, she pressed on. "After all these years together, Julian still cares about you. What we had was just a fling—"

"Shut up." Scarlett's voice was icy. "You disgust me."

Vanessa took a sharp breath. "Scarlett, do you really want to take this public? What good will that do you?"

Scarlett paused.

She had been fully immersed in filming and hadn't checked social media lately.

But she quickly realized—this must be Melanie's doing.

She swiftly switched screens to check the news.

Hearing her silence, Vanessa's tone turned threatening. "Given mine and Julian's status, the company will protect us. Do you really think you'll keep your lead role in 'Empress'?"

Scarlett continued scrolling through trending topics, ignoring her.

"Tell Sophia Laurent to back off. Otherwise, none of you will come out of this unscathed!"

A spark lit in Scarlett's eyes. "Sophia is the one posting?"

Hearing the delight in her voice, Vanessa gritted her teeth. "Stop pretending! Sophia may be a Lowell, but if this blows up, no one wins—"

Scarlett chuckled. "Tell Julian Lombardi to wake up from his delusions."

"Whatever Sophia does, I stand with her!"
###Chapter 174

Scarlett's voice rang clear and sharp through the phone, audible to both Julian and Vanessa on the other end.

"Scarlett, have you lost your mind?"

Julian's shout bordered on hysterical. "What good will destroying me do you?"

The panic lacing his words brought her immense satisfaction.

"No good at all. I simply enjoy it."

"Make Sophia shut her damn mouth, or you'll regret this."

"Oh?"

Her voice lifted with amusement. "How exactly will you make me regret it?"

A soft chuckle escaped her lips. "Julian, do you know what you sound like right now?"

His silence confirmed he anticipated her next words.

"A stray dog, barking helplessly."

Her tone turned glacial in an instant.

"I've endured your abuse for years. Did you really think empty threats would scare me now?"

Decades of suppressed hatred erupted. "Kill me if you dare. Otherwise, I'll make your life hell."

She and Melanie had spent years at Lowell Entertainment gathering evidence. No pathetic intimidation would stop them now.

The call ended with a decisive click.

Julian's furious roar echoed through the lounge as he destroyed everything within reach.

"That bitch! Whore!"

He should have crushed her completely when he had the chance.

Vanessa looked equally shaken.

Her nerves had been frayed before this meeting. Scarlett's ruthless words now filled her with terror.

She'd sacrificed too much to reach this position. Returning to obscurity wasn't an option.

"Julian, what do we do now?"

Tears welled in her eyes as she clutched his sleeve.

His expression darkened. "We go to Tiffany and Derek."

Their last remaining allies.

Meanwhile, Derek found himself drowning in scandal.

His failed attempt to coerce Scarlett into sexual favors had gone viral, sparking nationwide outrage.

Even Sophia's fans turned against him.

"How dare a predator like Derek hold an executive position?"

"Fire him immediately!"

"Multiple actresses have come forward about his harassment. Disgusting!"

Then came the most shocking revelation.

"Did you know Derek used to work in a slaughterhouse?"

The internet exploded.

"Seriously? That's a huge career shift."

"Confirmed. My uncle worked with him there."

In the digital age, netizens possessed frightening investigative skills.

Derek's entire sordid past soon lay exposed.

His unattractive appearance and beer belly became the least of his problems.

With only elementary school education, he'd been a street thug before the slaughterhouse job.
###Chapter 175

Derek Langley's past was laid bare for all to see.

In his youth, he'd been a street thug, loafing around and stirring up trouble.

His sister sold vegetables at the market. His brother-in-law was a butcher who couldn't stand his behavior any longer and shoved him into the slaughterhouse.

That butcher's knife stayed in his grip for four long years.

When the bloodstained work photo surfaced online, the internet erupted.

"Is this...CEO Langley?"

"Lowell Entertainment has lost its mind letting someone like him run the company!"

"I'm sick. That blood on his hands—"

The comment section exploded.

No one could connect this foul-smelling butcher to the polished entertainment mogul in designer suits.

"Investigate! We need the full story!"

"Rumor has it Emily Lowell personally promoted him..."

"Is Emily blind?"

Netizens feverishly dug for dirt.

Derek stared at his phone, sweat beading on his forehead. He dialed his niece's number, but only got a busy signal.

"Sir, what do we do?" His assistant trembled.

"Release a statement! Say the photo was photoshopped!"

The statement was immediately mocked.

"Think we're idiots?"

"His old slaughterhouse coworkers already confirmed it's real!"

Then Julian Lombardi's call came through.

"Sir! That bitch Scarlett has footage of me and Vanessa—"

"Noted." Derek suddenly smiled. "Perfect distraction material."

He hung up, eyes darkening.

"Draft a press release. Say Julian sexually harassed actresses and we're investigating."

The assistant froze. "But Julian's our ally..."

"Ever heard of sacrificing a pawn to save the king?" Derek crushed his cigarette. "Besides, he's always been dirty."

That afternoon, Julian's cheating scandal dominated the trending charts.

The internet instantly shifted its focus.

Watching the stock prices soar, Derek grinned—the same grin he'd worn in the slaughterhouse.
###Chapter 176

A faint, icy smirk curled at the corners of Derek Langley's lips as he listened to Julian Lombardi's gratitude over the phone.

He deliberately softened his tone. "Just focus on filming, Julian. Leave everything else to me."

Relief flooded Julian's voice, tinged with emotion. "Thank you, Mr. Langley. I'll return to set immediately."

After hanging up, a triumphant grin spread across Julian's face.

He turned to Vanessa Kalmien, preening. "Mimi, Mr. Langley agreed to handle this mess for us."

Vanessa immediately pressed closer, cooing, "I knew you could do it, Julian!"

His arm snaked around her waist as he whispered in her ear, "Of course. You know who I am."

Their intimate moment was shattered when explosive news broke online.

#TOP HEARTTHROB JULIAN LOMBARDI'S CHEATING SCANDAL EXPOSED#

The post detailed Julian's past relationship with Scarlett Ashcroft.

They had been college sweethearts who signed with Lowell Entertainment together after graduation. But after Julian's rise to fame, he began secretly seeing rising star Vanessa Kalmien.

The bombshell? The post included intimate photos of Julian and Vanessa—clearly showing their faces, with timestamps proving it happened during Julian's relationship with Scarlett.

The internet erupted.

"OMG! Scarlett's ex was Julian Lombardi?"

"What a scumbag!"

"Vanessa was the other woman?"

Public outrage exploded instantly.

Meanwhile, Derek Langley sipped red wine leisurely.

He'd long disliked Julian's arrogance.

This was the perfect opportunity to eliminate an unruly pawn.

The source of the leak?

He'd orchestrated it himself.

But no one would suspect the company CEO of airing dirty laundry.

After all, who would believe an executive would sabotage his own talent?

Derek swirled his glass, cold calculation flashing in his eyes.

"Let's see you recover from this one, Julian Lombardi."
###Chapter 177

The entertainment world exploded in an instant.

#JulianLombardiScarlettAshcroftRomance trended with a "breaking" tag.

Comments flooded in like a tidal wave.

"Julian Lombardi and Scarlett Ashcroft? This pairing is surreal!"

"Fake news! Wasn't Julian dating Vanessa Kalmien?"

"My favorite ship just sank."

Julian's fanbase went into meltdown.

Someone leaked intimate photos.

The images showed Julian embracing Scarlett in a hotel corridor.

The timestamp indicated last month.

Vanessa's fans immediately cried foul.

"Photoshopped! This has to be photoshopped!"

"Julian belongs with Vanessa!"

More evidence surfaced.

Matching couple bracelets.

Dining receipts from the same restaurant.

Even vacation photos taken abroad by fans.

The scandal snowballed.

Lowell Entertainment's official account got bombarded.

"Release a statement already!"

"Is your PR team asleep?"

Julian was filming on set when his assistant rushed over.

"Boss, we've got a crisis!"

He checked his phone and turned pale.

"How did this happen..."

He immediately called Vanessa.

"Vanessa, have you seen the news?"

Sobs echoed through the receiver.

"Didn't Mr. Langley promise to suppress this?"

Cold sweat dripped down Julian's forehead.

"I'll contact Tiffany right now."

His hands shook as he dialed Tiffany Merouin.

Tiffany had just finished showering.

Seeing the caller ID, she sighed.

"Julian..."

"Tiffany, can the company handle PR for this?"

Silence stretched for several seconds.

"This time... it's complicated."

Julian's heart plummeted.

Inside Lowell Entertainment's executive office, Derek Langley monitored the chaos.

A smirk played on his lips.

"Perfect distraction."

He swiftly deleted incriminating posts about himself.

Fingers drummed against the desk.

"Sophia Laurent..."

Darkness flickered in his eyes.

How had someone uncovered his buried secrets?

He made a call.

"Find out who's behind this."

After hanging up, Derek studied Julian's trending scandal.

A satisfied smile spread.

"Excellent scapegoat."
###Chapter 178

The scandal between Julian Lombardi and Vanessa Kalmien dominated the trending list for three straight days.

Fans transitioned from initial shock to wavering uncertainty as public opinion gradually shifted.

Entertainment blogs released crystal-clear photo and video evidence, even mapping out a detailed timeline.

Most unsettling was the eerie silence from both parties' social media accounts.

Desperate fans flooded Scarlett Ashcroft's comment section.

"Scarlett, please say something. Did Julian really betray you?"

"Was Vanessa the other woman all along?"

"Are these rumors true? I'm losing my mind!"

Scarlett's phone buzzed nonstop after work.

She opened her social media to find her inbox and comments flooded.

A quick scan revealed the full story.

Seeing Julian and Vanessa's continued silence, a cold smirk curled her lips.

Their management had clearly abandoned these disgraced stars.

With their accounts under agency control, neither dared to make a move.

Watching them drown in public outrage brought Scarlett unprecedented satisfaction.

Years of pent-up grievances finally found release.

Now it was their turn to taste nationwide scorn.

Without hesitation, she dropped a bombshell statement:

"Yes, Julian was my college sweetheart. During our cohabitation, he repeatedly brought Vanessa home for overnight stays. Though not in my bed, it was disgusting enough. As for the Derek Langley incident—that was also his setup."

The post detonated across the internet.

Comments erupted instantly.

"Oh my god! Julian is actual trash!"

"Cheating right under his girlfriend's nose? Disgusting!"

"No wonder Scarlett's career stagnated—she was being sabotaged by these snakes!"

Their diehard fans suffered the hardest blow.

Scarlett's receipts shattered their last shreds of denial.

Mass fan exodus began immediately.

"Three years of loyalty wasted on trash!"

"Officially unstanning today. This is heartbreaking!"

"Most disgusting celebrity downfall of the year!"

"Not just cheating but framing his ex? Pure evil!"

The scandal escalated into an unstoppable storm, obliterating Julian and Vanessa's careers.
###Chapter 179

The online discussion reached fever pitch when someone unearthed disturbing details from the "River Banquet" premiere ceremony.

Tiffany Merouin's spontaneous remark now seemed chilling upon reflection.

"Did Scarlett Ashcroft slap Julian Lombardi?"

Back then, netizens speculated about Scarlett and Julian's relationship.

Now the truth was out.

A scumbag like him deserved worse than a beating.

Thankfully, Scarlett had wisely left Lowell Entertainment—that soul-crushing corporation.

Fans flooded the comments: "Fly high, Queen Scarlett! We've got your back!"

Julian Lombardi and Vanessa Kalmien's silence fueled the fire.

Within hours, Julian's fan clubs dissolved en masse.

Vanessa's "straight-shooter" persona from reality shows imploded overnight.

Their acting careers were effectively over.

Brands scrambled to terminate contracts.

The "River Banquet" production team faced relentless backlash.

"Were you blind during casting?"

"Is Lowell Entertainment a breeding ground for scum?"

"Heard many artists are switching to Pearl Group."

"Thank Sophia Laurent for exposing Lowell Entertainment's true colors."

Richard Lowell nearly fainted upon seeing the news.

"Empress" character stills and audition tapes garnered universal praise.

Meanwhile, "River Banquet" lost both male leads consecutively.

The entire internet predicted its flop.

Richard trembled with rage, snarling through clenched teeth: "Sophia! Laurent!"

This daughter was his nemesis from birth.

On set, he hurled documents across the floor.

The only solution—recast the male lead.

"River Banquet's" reputation plummeted.

"Empress" buzz soared.

Richard watched his marketing efforts backfire spectacularly.

All his promotion had benefited "Empress" instead.

He swallowed the bitter pill.

As Richard fumed, Derek Langley exhaled in quiet relief...
###Chapter 180

The opening ceremony for "River Banquet" had barely concluded when the production team faced a series of setbacks.

Julian Lombardi and Vanessa Kalmien's scandal broke, turning them into pariahs overnight.

Richard Lowell scrambled to recast the male lead, but the damage was irreversible.

The official account's follower count plummeted daily.

Richard stared at his computer screen, consumed by regret.

If only he hadn't listened to those poisonous whispers and targeted Scarlett Ashcroft.

Lucas Sheridan was immersed in post-production for "Empress," paying no attention to the drama.

Derek Langley watched the fading hashtags with relief.

He immediately ordered the PR department to issue a statement:

"Lowell Entertainment deeply regrets its failure to oversee our artists' conduct. We have terminated contracts with Julian Lombardi and Vanessa Kalmien. Moving forward, we will enforce stricter ethical standards."

The statement masterfully absolved the company of all blame.

Pearl Group CEO's office.

Sophia Laurent scrolled through the news on her phone, lips curling in disdain.

Did Derek really think he could walk away unscathed?

Her meticulous plans weren't for those two pathetic clowns.

Why should such scum enjoy freedom?

She'd vehemently opposed Derek's appointment at Lowell Entertainment years ago.

But Emily Lowell's single word had swayed William Lowell's judgment.

Derek was Emily's maternal uncle—a well-kept secret.

That summer when Sophia was ten, her adoptive parents sent her to care for her bedridden grandmother in an isolated mountain village.

Derek was the local troublemaker—a petty thief who loitered all day.

No one visited Grandmother's thatched cottage.

Until Sophia arrived.

Then Derek started lurking nearby.

At dawn each day, the ten-year-old rose to cook porridge, wash clothes, and forage for wild greens.

She never imagined human depravity could run so deep.

One morning while gathering herbs on the mountain path, rustling footsteps approached from behind.

"All alone, Sophia?"

Derek's greasy voice slithered over her shoulder.

His pockmarked face and lecherous gaze made her skin crawl.

Instinct screamed danger.

She turned and ran.
###Chapter 181

Sophia Laurent despised her idle uncle Derek Langley to the core.

She turned to leave immediately.

Derek grabbed her wrist forcefully.

"Why the hurry, Sophia?"

He eyed his niece with narrowed eyes.

Sophia's porcelain skin glowed, her delicate features a stark contrast to the sun-darkened village girls.

Derek had long known Sophia's true origins.

This so-called "niece" was actually a wealthy city heiress.

He licked his lips.

The village women had grown boring.

He'd never tasted nobility before.

"Let's play a game, niece..."

Sophia forced composure.

"Mother's visiting today. I must meet her at the village entrance."

She used Derek's own sister as a shield.

Derek sneered.

"Your mother visiting you?"

He knew exactly how his sister treated this adopted daughter.

"Liars deserve punishment..."

Sophia shivered at his lecherous grin.

She suddenly bent down and sank her teeth into Derek's hand.

"Ah!"

Derek released her in pain.

Then slapped her hard across the face.

Sophia's cheek burned.

She ignored the pain and bolted.

"You little bitch!"

Derek roared, chasing after her.

Sophia darted nimbly through the trees.

But soon, a raging river blocked her path.

The dark waters churned violently.

With Derek closing in behind her...

Sophia clenched her teeth.

And leaped into the torrent.

Derek reached the bank, stunned.

The current was too dangerous even for him.

He ran along the shore briefly.

Sophia had already vanished beneath the rapids.

Returning to the spot...

Derek picked up Sophia's abandoned basket.

And tossed it into the river.

Deep wilderness. Who'd know the truth?

A girl picking mushrooms alone could easily drown.

He hummed a tune back to the village.

Resumed harassing passing women.

As if nothing had happened.
###Chapter 182

The icy river swallowed Sophia Laurent's breath in an instant.

Her mind went blank. Only the roaring water filled her ears.

Derek Langley's sinister eyes haunted her thoughts like a venomous snake.

Pure survival instinct made her leap into the raging current without hesitation.

Her adoptive parents never taught her to swim.

In that household, she existed only as unpaid labor.

Endless chores. Hand-me-down clothes.

As water flooded her nostrils, Sophia remembered her elementary school P.E. teacher's advice.

Stay calm when drowning. Use both arms and legs.

She thrashed desperately, fighting to surface.

But the current dragged her deeper.

Her lungs burned like fire.

Limbs grew heavier.

Consciousness faded.

Just as she was about to give up, a warm, strong hand grasped hers.

"Don't be afraid."

The boy's voice was cool yet firm.

Through the watery haze, she saw mesmerizing peach-blossom eyes.

The most beautiful eyes she'd ever seen.

Sophia mustered her last strength to clutch that hand.

When she awoke again, a crystal chandelier glittered above her.

"Awake?"

A kind middle-aged woman approached with steaming chicken soup.

"I'm the housekeeper here. Call me Margaret."

Sophia scanned the room warily.

This bedroom was larger than her adoptive parents' entire apartment.

"Th...thank you."

Her voice came out hoarse, throat scorched with pain.

Margaret gently asked for her address.

Sophia named that nightmare place.

The adoptive mother's curses. The father's belt. The grandmother's cane.

She trembled uncontrollably at the memories.

"What a poor child."

Pity flickered in Margaret's eyes.

"Can you tell me who saved me?"

Sophia asked cautiously.

"The young master."

Margaret smoothed the blankets with a smile. "But he flew abroad this morning."

Sophia lowered her lashes, hiding the disappointment.

Those eyes—she might never see them again.
###Chapter 183

"Please convey my gratitude to him for saving my life."

"I'll make sure he gets your message."

As Sophia Laurent finished her meal and followed the woman out of the dining hall, her gaze was drawn to a photograph on the wall.

The boy in the picture had delicate features, his deep peach-blossom eyes gradually overlapping with the face she'd seen before losing consciousness.

Returning to her adoptive parents' home, her father's expression darkened the moment he saw her.

"Who said you could come back?"

The man's roar made Sophia's fingers tremble.

"Dad, I don't want to go back to the countryside."

Her words ignited his fury.

The belt whistled through the air. Sophia instinctively dodged.

But she was too small, too weak. The strikes still found their mark.

Her adoptive mother watched coldly until Sophia collapsed. "Keep this up and we'll have hospital bills to pay. You covering those?"

The fever burned for a full week.

No one visited except for the occasional dry bun her mother tossed her way.

Sophia endured.

From that day forward, the boy took up residence in her heart.

The memory drained the color from Sophia's face.

She never imagined their reunion would happen at Lowell Entertainment.

By then she was chief secretary. Derek Langley had risen to general manager.

During their work handover, Sophia could scarcely believe her eyes.

The school dropout, the former gangster, now sat across from her in a tailored suit.

Her investigation yielded even more shocking results.

It was undeniably the same person.

Derek had already entrenched himself in the company.

Sophia immediately went to William Lowell.

"His division's performance grew by 30%. That's called competence," William said dismissively.

"He's morally bankrupt!"

"You know him so well. Did you two have something going on?"

Sophia trembled with rage.

Personnel decisions were beyond her authority.

She avoided Derek whenever possible.

Years passed without incident.

Until she recruited Scarlett Ashcroft and Melanie Vance. Only then did she uncover the truth behind those performance numbers.

Derek's methods were despicable.

Forcing artists to entertain clients had become routine.

Even male performers weren't spared when securing deals.

This was Lowell Entertainment's "secret to success."
###Chapter 184

The online storm gradually subsided after Lowell Entertainment issued a statement cutting all ties with Julian Lombardi and Vanessa Kalmien.

Derek Langley finally relaxed when he saw the related hashtags disappear from the trending list.

He picked up his coffee cup from the desk, a smug smile curling his lips.

Just as the cup touched his mouth, his secretary burst into the office in panic.

"Mr. Langley, there's trouble!"

His hand jerked, spilling scalding coffee onto his tailored suit.

Without bothering to wipe it off, he snatched the tablet from his secretary's hands.

The screen displayed the current top trending topic:
#LowellEntertainment DerekLangley Forces Celebrities To Entertain Clients#

Right below it:
#DerekLangley's Gangster Origins#
#LowellEntertainment Escort List Exposed#

Derek's face turned deathly pale.

With trembling fingers, he tapped the hashtag. Endless exposés and photos flooded the screen.

There were intimate shots of him embracing A-list actresses at parties.

A video of him groping a rookie actor in a KTV private room.

Most damning of all—a photo showing a line of Lowell Entertainment artists standing in a luxury suite, waiting to be "selected" by investors.

"This can't be..." he muttered.

His phone suddenly vibrated violently.

The caller ID showed "Chairman Lowell."

Before he could return the call, his office door swung open again.

This time, it was a team of uniformed police officers.

"Derek Langley, you're under arrest for suspected involvement in prostitution, sexual assault, bribery, and other charges."

The lead officer displayed the arrest warrant.

Derek's legs gave out, and he collapsed onto the floor.

As the officers hauled him away, employees crowded the hallway, watching the spectacle.

Some discreetly raised their phones to record the scene.

Three minutes later, #DerekLangleyArrested rocketed to the top of the trending list.

Comments poured in like a tidal wave:

"Serves him right! That entertainment industry parasite should've been locked up ages ago!"
"Lowell Entertainment is finished. Their stocks already hit the limit down!"
"What about the artists on that list? Were they all victims?"
"Some were willing participants. They'd do anything for resources!"

Meanwhile, in the top-floor conference room at Lowell Entertainment headquarters...

The board members were holding an emergency meeting.

"Release a statement immediately, claiming the company had no knowledge of Derek's actions."
"Suspend all activities for the implicated artists."
"Launch crisis PR to salvage the company's image."

Chairman Lowell listened with a dark expression, his fountain pen creaking under his grip.

This storm was only just beginning.
###Chapter 185

The news of Derek Langley's sudden appointment at Lowell Entertainment sent shockwaves across the internet.

Insiders revealed Emily Lowell personally recommended him for the position.

William Lowell received an urgent call the moment the scandal broke.

His fingers trembled as he checked the trending topics. His face turned deathly pale.

"This can't be happening..."

Stock prices plummeted. Investors frantically sold off shares. Billions in market value evaporated overnight.

Lowell Entertainment was the group's most profitable subsidiary.

Its collapse would cripple the entire Lowell empire.

William immediately ordered a media blackout.

But public outrage spread faster than anticipated. The PR department couldn't contain the fallout.

Cold sweat soaked through his dress shirt.

Chaos had reigned since Sophia Laurent left. Shareholders' displeasure was written on their faces.

This scandal was the final straw.

He issued a stiff apology statement through gritted teeth.

Netizens only grew angrier:

"Who do they think they're fooling with this corporate speak?"
"What's Derek Langley's connection to get William's personal endorsement?"
"Did he save Emily's life or something?"

The narrative took a dark turn.

Internet sleuths began digging into Derek's background.

"Bombshell! Derek's sister and brother-in-law are Sophia's adoptive parents!"

This revelation exploded across social media.

"So Sophia was behind Derek's appointment?"
"Then why is she helping Scarlett?"
"This is clearly revenge against the Lowells!"

Public opinion split into opposing camps.

Reporters swarmed the neighborhood where Sophia's adoptive parents lived.

An elderly silver-haired woman eyed the journalists warily:

"Why are you looking for the butcher's family?"

A microphone was thrust toward her:

"We'd like to ask some questions..."

The woman snorted and moved to slam the door.

But the cameras caught the flicker of disgust in her eyes.
###Chapter 186

The elderly woman wrinkled her nose in disdain. "What could they possibly have to say?"

She turned to leave.

A reporter quickly blocked her path. "Do you know Sophia Laurent?"

The woman froze mid-step. Her tone softened instantly. "Has something happened to Sophia?"

The reporter's eyes lit up.

"We heard Sophia isn't the biological child of the butcher's family. We wanted to learn about her childhood..."

The old woman's eyes widened in shock. "Not their real daughter?"

She suddenly slapped her thigh in realization.

"No wonder!"

Before the reporter could react, the woman began stomping her feet in anger.

"I always wondered how those two could be so cruel! Now it makes sense!"

"That poor child never had a warm meal growing up. She wore nothing but hand-me-downs."

"When she got sick, they made her tough it out. She was doing laundry and cooking when she could barely reach the stove! Heartless monsters!"

Her voice cracked with emotion.

"My poor Sophia... to be stuck with such adoptive parents..."

The reporters exchanged glances.

They visited several more neighbors. The responses were eerily similar.

The video went viral the moment it was uploaded.

Oh my God! Sophia suffered like that as a child? How did the Lauren family lose her?

No food? No medical care? Are they even human?

Those adoptive parents are no better than Derek Langley!

So Derek wasn't actually hired because of Sophia's recommendation?

Emily Lowell's fans immediately jumped to defend her.

Derek is Sophia's adoptive mother's younger brother. Who else would've recommended him?

Exactly! Emily would never associate with someone like that!

Stop dragging Emily into this! She's the real Lowell heiress—why would she know such people?

Netizens didn't know about the baby swap.

Emily's fans genuinely believed she was the biological daughter.

The online debate grew heated.

At Lowell Entertainment, William Lowell paced like a caged animal.

He once considered Emily his lucky charm.

Ever since she recommended Derek to manage the entertainment division, profits soared 30-50%.

Shareholders praised his foresight daily during that period.

Now karma had arrived with brutal speed.

William's brow furrowed as he scrolled through the trending discussions.

Only he knew the truth.

Emily was actually the butcher's daughter.
###Chapter 187

Blood Relation

William Lowell stared at the investigation report in his hands, his fingertips trembling slightly.

The black-and-white document clearly stated—Derek Langley was Emily Lowell's biological uncle.

He never imagined that the adopted daughter he cherished would share blood ties with the biggest parasite in his company.

Emily had lived in luxury since childhood. How could she possibly know a street gangster?

What's more suspicious was her insistence on recommending this man for a position at Lowell Entertainment.

Derek's resume had looked impeccable at the time. Who would have guessed it was entirely fabricated?

William recalled Sophia's vehement objections, his chest tightening with pain.

He had even accused Sophia of having a personal grudge against Derek.

Now, the thought seemed utterly ridiculous.

"Mr. Lowell!" His assistant burst in, panic in his voice. "The shareholders have gathered. They're furious."

The file slipped from William's grasp and fell to the floor.

He knew they had come to demand answers.

His legs weakened, forcing him to grip the desk for support.

At this moment, he missed Sophia more than ever.

His daughter, who had once managed the company with flawless efficiency.

In just one month, Lowell Entertainment had descended into chaos.

"Should we ask the senior Mr. Lowell to return?" the assistant cautiously suggested.

William shook his head.

His father had been immersed in the film industry for years and was no longer familiar with corporate affairs.

Taking a deep breath, he finally made up his mind.

The only person who could save Lowell Entertainment now was Sophia.

As for Emily... that matter would have to wait.

"Tell the shareholders I'll personally address their concerns in a few days."

William grabbed his car keys and strode out.

If he apologized sincerely, Sophia would surely come back.

This thought alone renewed his resolve.
###Chapter 188

William Lowell's assistant inwardly groaned at his instructions.

The Lowell Group had been in chaos lately. Shareholders' private deals kept falling through, and partners demanded explanations daily.

Tempers flared among the board members. Anyone crossing their path became collateral damage.

William's assistants and secretaries bore the brunt of their fury. They missed the days when Sophia Laurent had managed things.

The assistant sighed but replied obediently, "Understood, Mr. Lowell."

William left the office, heading straight for Pearl Group.

Sophia had blocked his number. Given her current attitude, he had no choice but to visit in person.

During the drive, William reflected.

Sophia's rebellious phase was clearly just a cry for attention.

He admitted the family had favored Emily slightly. But could they be blamed? Sophia had brought this on herself with her stubbornness.

If she would just apologize, everything could return to normal.

Thirty minutes later, William stood before Pearl Group's headquarters.

This visit felt entirely different from his last.

Previously, he'd arrived full of resentment, finding fault everywhere. Today, he came humbly seeking reconciliation.

Having steeled himself, William felt optimistic.

His gaze swept over Pearl Group's modern facade, approval growing.

Once merged with Lowell Entertainment, the combined entity would elevate the family's status further.

Add Sophia's marriage into the Valdemar family and Patriarch Valdemar's favor, and their fortunes would soar.

His pleasant daydream shattered when a receptionist stopped him.

"Good afternoon, sir. Who are you here to see?"

William frowned. "You don't recognize me?"

The receptionist maintained her professional smile. "Do you have an appointment?"

"I need an appointment to enter my own company?" William scoffed.

"All visitors require appointments," she replied firmly.

William's expression darkened. "What kind of training does your front desk receive? Can't even identify key figures?"

The receptionist mentally rolled her eyes. Who did this arrogant man think he was?

"I'm sorry, but unauthorized persons aren't permitted to loiter."

William's face turned stormy. After a long stare, he suddenly laughed. "Fine, no point arguing with you."

"Is Sophia in?"

"That information isn't public."

"I'm her brother! Step aside!"

"All meetings with the CEO require appointments."

William's anger erupted. "Do you believe I can have you fired with one word?"

The receptionist's smile never wavered. "No, I don't."
###Chapter 189
William's Humiliation

William's smile froze instantly.

He slammed his palm on the reception desk. "Who do you think you are?"

The receptionist remained unfazed, pressing the intercom. "Security, disturbance at the main lobby."

William's eyes widened.

Was everyone in this damn company insane?

The memory of Christopher being dragged out by security flashed through his mind. He forced his rage down.

"I'm here for a business discussion," he said through gritted teeth, forcing a stiff smile.

The receptionist offered a professional smile. "Apologies. Mr. Valdemar's explicit orders—Lowells and dogs aren't permitted on the premises."

William's face darkened.

His fists clenched until his knuckles turned white.

Five security officers approached. "Supervisor Morrison, this gentleman?"

"Yes. Please escort him out."

Before William could react, two guards seized his arms.

"You're dead meat! Do you know who I am?"

Ignoring him, they hauled him through the revolving doors.

Sunlight blinded him momentarily.

Standing on the steps, his suit now crumpled, William kicked the stone pillar viciously.

"Filthy guard dogs!"

Stomping toward the underground garage, he decided to lie in wait.

Three hours later.

The elevator doors slid open.

Sophia stepped out in stilettos, phone pressed to her ear.

"Grandfather, I'm on my way."

Hanging up, she suddenly halted.

William emerged from the shadows with a plastered smile.

"Sophia, long time no see."

She narrowed her eyes.

Slowly pocketing her phone, she tilted her head.

"Did Mr. Lowell switch careers to become a stalker?"

His smile faltered.

Taking a deep breath, he said, "We need to talk."

Sophia let out a soft laugh.

"About what? Your graceful exit courtesy of security?"

She moved past him toward her parking spot.

"Or how the Lowells betrayed their adopted daughter?"

William blocked her path.

"That was all a misunderstanding!"

Sophia stopped.

She studied him with cold amusement.

"You know what?"

"That pathetic look on your face right now..."

"Is more repulsive than flies in a public restroom."
###Chapter 190

William Lowell's carefully constructed emotional appeal shattered with Sophia Laurent's single remark.

He suppressed his irritation, forcing a gentle smile onto his face.

"Sophia, your elder brother was too hasty before. Please don't take it to heart."

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

"William Lowell came specifically to apologize?"

She gave a light chuckle. "How extraordinary."

A flicker of discomfort crossed William's face.

"If you require it, I'll apologize right now."

His expression turned earnest. "We were wrong to neglect your feelings before."

Sophia observed his performance in silence.

What new scheme was this?

Interpreting her silence as acquiescence, William pressed on.

"Sophia, I saw those interview videos..."

His face contorted with feigned distress. "I never imagined your adoptive parents treated you so cruelly..."

"Oh." Sophia responded coldly.

Those videos had been an unplanned consequence.

Her original intention was merely to expose Derek Langley's true nature and reveal Emily Lowell's character to the Lowell family.

Emily's placement of Derek in Lowell Entertainment undoubtedly concealed deeper schemes.

She didn't believe a single word of William's hollow concern.

If the Lowells truly cared, they wouldn't have waited until now to show concern.

She hadn't forgotten how Richard Lowell and William had practically wanted to strangle her before.

William continued his act.

"Come home. This time we'll treat you properly."

His eyes brimmed with manufactured hope. "Give us a chance to make amends, won't you?"

Sophia met his expectant gaze and murmured, "Home?"

"Yes, home." William nodded eagerly.

Sophia smiled.

"You're right. It is time to go home. Excuse me."

William's eyes lit up.

"You'll return?"

Finally, he could rid himself of the company's mess.

Had he known it would be this easy, he would have come sooner.

Sophia found his delighted expression laughable.

"Poor memory, William? I'm Mrs. Valdemar now."

William's face froze.

"Sophia, you—"

Sophia opened her car door without hesitation.

"I'm visiting my husband at the sanatorium."

The curve of her lips held no warmth as she spoke.
###Chapter 191

William Lowell stood frozen in place.

Those words had pierced his heart like a blade.

Sophia Laurent's taillights disappeared around the corner, leaving only a wisp of exhaust in their wake.

His fists clenched until his nails bit into his palms.

How dare that vegetative man?

He was her real brother.

Twenty years of family ties meant nothing compared to a stranger lying in a hospital bed.

William's chest heaved violently. Black spots danced before his eyes.

He remembered Sophia chasing after him as a child, calling him "big brother" in that sweet voice.

She had been so obedient then.

Sophia's car descended into the underground parking of Valdemar Sanatorium.

She checked her phone after cutting the engine.

A message from Margaret Delaney's doctor: The patient regained consciousness briefly this morning—five minutes.

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

The elevator carried her straight to the VIP ward on the top floor.

Patriarch Valdemar looked up from his paperwork at the sound of footsteps.

"Grandfather."

Sophia's voice was bright and clear.

The old man set down his fountain pen, the creases around his eyes softening.

"Perfect timing. The kitchen just finished stewing chicken soup."

Four dishes and a soup waited on the dining table.

Sophia picked up a braised pork rib with her chopsticks. The meat fell apart tenderly at the slightest pressure.

She ate with relish, her cheeks puffing slightly with each bite.

Patriarch Valdemar studied her.

His granddaughter-in-law was more resilient than he'd expected.

"How's work lately?"

Sophia swallowed before answering. "Smooth. The new project launches next week."

She made no mention of the Lowell family.

The old man nodded, his gaze flickering to her flat stomach.

"Alexander woke briefly this morning."

Sophia's chopsticks stilled.

"Did the doctor say he's improving?"

"Yes. His fingers moved."

His tone was measured, but a glimmer of relief shone in his eyes.

Sophia lowered her head over her rice bowl. Her lashes cast shadows across her cheeks.

She pictured the pale man in the hospital bed.

Last time she saw him, his eyelids had fluttered.

Like butterfly wings.

"Margaret was conscious for a while today too."

Patriarch Valdemar's sudden remark made Sophia's head snap up. Her eyes glittered like stars.

"Really? What did she say?"

"She called your name."

Sophia's nose stung.

She ducked her head to sip soup, letting the steam blur her vision.

The meal continued in unusual quiet.

Only the occasional clink of tableware broke the silence.

Sunlight streamed through the window, gilding Sophia's hair.

A golden halo.
###Chapter 192

Sophia Laurent stared at the exquisite dishes on the dining table, but her thoughts drifted to Margaret Delaney's sickbed. Patriarch Valdemar, meanwhile, was weighed down by worries, the recent turmoil at the company leaving him restless.

The aroma of braised pork ribs filled the dining room, the meat so tender it practically melted in the mouth.

The rich scent of wild mushroom chicken soup wafted through the air, while the greens were crisp and fresh enough to snap.

Sophia helped herself to two bowls of rice and finished an entire bowl of soup. Her unpretentious appetite eased the tension in Patriarch Valdemar's brow.

"Sophia, if you need anything, come to me. If I'm not here, ask the butler."

Her eyes curved into crescents. "Thank you, Grandfather."

Before the words fully left her lips, the front door burst open with a violent crash.

"Father, what exactly do you think you're doing?"

Patriarch Valdemar's expression darkened instantly. "What are you doing here?"

The intruder, a well-preserved man in his early forties, now flushed with anger, stormed in.

"Alexander is in a vegetative state! Why won't you let Sebastian into headquarters?"

"Enough!" Patriarch Valdemar slammed his hands on the table and stood. "Alexander will wake up!"

The middle-aged man's veins bulged with fury. "You're too biased! What has Sebastian ever done to deserve less than that living corpse?"

"Get out!" Patriarch Valdemar grabbed a rice bowl and hurled it at him.

The man dodged nimbly, his gaze suddenly locking onto Sophia. "So this is the healing bride you found for Alexander?"

His voice dripped with sarcasm. "Afraid he'll be lonely on his way to the grave?"

Sophia instantly recognized him—Vincent Valdemar, Alexander's biological father.

Patriarch Valdemar trembled with rage, snatching up a plate and throwing it. "Security! Throw him out!"

The butler and guards rushed in, seizing Vincent by the arms.

Vincent shook them off, shouting as he was dragged away, "Don't blame me for what happens next, since you clearly favor one son over the other!"

Silence finally returned to the room—only for Patriarch Valdemar to clutch his chest and collapse backward.

"Call a doctor!" the butler cried.

The villa erupted into chaos.

By the time the doctor arrived, Henry Chamberlain, Alexander's assistant, had also hurried in. He checked his watch repeatedly, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

"Doctor, how is he?"

The doctor removed his stethoscope. "The shock was too much. He needs complete rest."
###Chapter 193

Henry Chamberlain exchanged a glance with the butler. Both men frowned simultaneously.

"The Valdemar Group's press conference is in half an hour. Given the Patriarch's current condition..." Henry's voice was grave.

Dr. Whitmore shook his head decisively. "Absolutely not."

His expression turned solemn. "The Patriarch needs complete rest. Any stress could worsen his condition."

Though the doctor phrased it diplomatically, everyone understood the implication.

A heavy silence fell over the hospital room.

"I'll go," Henry broke the silence.

The butler immediately objected. "No. Without a Valdemar family member present, it'll only fuel speculation. The stock price will plummet further."

Henry massaged his temples. "But we don't have better options right now."

Alexander Valdemar had regained consciousness, but his awareness came and went.

Not to mention his multiple fractures made public appearances impossible.

This press conference had been scheduled when both the Patriarch and Alexander were lucid, meant to stabilize the Valdemar Group's situation.

No one anticipated Vincent Valdemar would provoke the Patriarch into collapsing at this critical juncture.

The Valdemar direct lineage now only included Vincent.

But letting him represent the family? That was laughable.

Vincent was a hopeless incompetent who favored his illegitimate son Sebastian.

Allowing him to speak for Valdemar Holdings would mean surrendering the Patriarch's lifelong work.

Worse still, Vincent's recent phone call clearly had ulterior motives.

If internal chaos erupted, certain parties would exploit the situation.

As the two men reached an impasse, a clear voice interrupted:

"Have you forgotten the family member the Patriarch just acknowledged?"

Sophia Laurent hadn't planned to involve herself in Valdemar affairs.

She intended to leave eventually.

But the Patriarch had treated her well. Since circumstances demanded it, she saw no harm in helping.

Before marrying into the family, she'd done thorough research.

The Patriarch had long retired from frontline operations, with Alexander steering Valdemar Holdings.

Alexander's ironclad principles and fair dealings commanded respect even from industry veterans.

His presence alone kept dissenters in check.

But since his accident, subtle shifts had begun.

Initially, things remained calm.

As time passed, however, probing attempts multiplied.

The family publicly called it a car accident with ongoing treatment.

Yet industry circles already buzzed with rumors of Alexander's vegetative state.

This press conference aimed to restore confidence in Valdemar Holdings.

Stabilizing the stock price would buy time to address internal issues.

But with the Patriarch aging and Alexander's prolonged unconsciousness, the situation would only deteriorate.
###Chapter 194

Undercurrents surged within Valdemar Holdings. Both Patriarch Valdemar and Alexander Valdemar found themselves in precarious positions.

As Alexander's nominal wife, Sophia Laurent was inevitably swept into the turmoil.

Vincent Valdemar, though mediocre in ability, had spent years cultivating loyalists within the corporation. His sudden visit to the sanatorium clearly harbored ulterior motives.

"Young Madam?"

Henry Chamberlain and the butler finally noticed Sophia standing nearby. The clarity in the young woman's voice momentarily brightened their expressions before dimming again.

The press conference concealed unseen dangers, with treacherous questions lurking at every turn. Could this inexperienced girl possibly handle it?

Sophia sensed their hesitation and remained silent. She was willing to step forward, but if they lacked trust in her, she had her own contingency plans.

Henry and the butler exchanged glances. The young woman's gaze remained steady, her composure unshaken by the earlier commotion.

"Then we'll entrust this to Young Madam."

With major media outlets already assembled, canceling the press conference was impossible. As Alexander's legal wife, Sophia was indeed more suitable than any assistant to make an appearance.

Henry quickly arranged, "Young Madam, I'll have someone prepare briefing materials and talking points for you to review en route. First, we'll get you styled, then proceed directly to the venue."

"Understood."

The butler remained at the hospital to attend to Patriarch Valdemar while Henry escorted Sophia away in haste.

In the car, Sophia pored over the documents. Rumors swirled that Alexander had entered a vegetative state, causing fluctuations in Valdemar's stock prices. This press conference aimed to dispel misinformation and stabilize the market.

Yet Sophia suspected deeper machinations. Despite the Valdemars' prolonged media blackout, the rumors had only intensified—clear evidence of orchestrated manipulation.

Vincent's earlier conduct unmistakably sought to position Sebastian Valdemar for succession. His timing in provoking the patriarch suggested calculated maneuvers.

This press conference would likely be anything but peaceful.

As a corporate titan, Valdemar Holdings' every move sent ripples through the markets. News of Alexander's car accident had long circulated through business circles.

The press conference venue was packed to capacity, with major media outlets poised for action. When the entourage stepped onto the stage, every lens instantly focused on the center.
###Chapter 195

Under the spotlight, a slender figure ascended the stage with measured grace.

The deep blue velvet gown accentuated her flawless silhouette, its hem swaying gently with each step. Imperial jade glowed softly under the lights, complementing her porcelain skin. Her exquisite features were framed by piercing phoenix eyes that radiated icy composure.

Henry Chamberlain followed closely behind with Valdemar Holdings' executive team, maintaining a respectful three-meter distance.

The auditorium fell into stunned silence.

Reporters exchanged bewildered glances. A few discreetly raised their cameras, capturing rapid shots.

"Where is Patriarch Valdemar for today's announcement?" A bespectaced male journalist demanded, skepticism sharp in his tone.

Sophia Laurent stood center stage, her gaze sweeping the room with calm authority.

She accepted the microphone effortlessly. "Effective immediately," her clear voice resonated, "Valdemar Holdings is under my full stewardship."

Live stream comments exploded.

"Who is this woman?"
"Wait—isn't she..."
"My God, that's Sophia Laurent!"

Below the stage, murmurs rippled through the press corps. Camera flashes erupted like scattered fireworks.

"What is your relationship to Valdemar Holdings?" A female reporter's pointed question cut through the noise.

Sophia's lips curved into a perfectly calibrated smile.

"I am Alexander Valdemar's lawful wife."

The room erupted in chaos.

"Impossible!" A gray-suited journalist shot to his feet. "There's never been any public announcement of Mr. Valdemar's marriage!"

Sophia's eyes frosted over. Her fingers tapped the microphone once.

"Since when do the Valdemars announce private matters to the world?" Her tone remained unhurried. "Our betrothal was sealed twenty years ago, witnessed by both families."

With a pivot, she revealed a yellowed marriage certificate displayed on the giant screen.

"As for you," Sophia's gaze sharpened like a blade, "that Patek Philippe on your wrist was gifted by Lockwood Group's PR department last week, correct?"

The reporter's face drained of color.
###Chapter 196

Sophia Laurent stood on the stage in a sleek black business suit, her delicate features strikingly illuminated under the spotlight.

Her calm gaze swept across the room as she spoke in a clear, commanding voice.

"Members of the press, I'm Sophia Laurent, acting CEO of Valdemar Holdings."

Whispers rippled through the crowd of journalists, their curiosity palpable at this unfamiliar face.

A bespectacled male reporter abruptly stood, his tone aggressive.

"Why isn't Patriarch Valdemar or Mr. Valdemar himself presiding over such an important press conference?"

The corner of Sophia's lips lifted slightly, but her eyes turned frosty.

"My husband Alexander is currently recuperating. I'm handling corporate affairs on his behalf."

The room erupted in murmurs.

A female journalist seized the opportunity.

"Rumors claim Mr. Valdemar remains in a vegetative state after the car accident. Is this true?"

Henry Chamberlain clenched his fists nervously nearby.

Sophia adjusted her cufflinks with composed elegance.

"Alexander is indeed in a coma following the accident."

Dead silence blanketed the auditorium.

The reporter blinked, unprepared for such direct confirmation.

Live stream comments exploded across screens.

"She's insane! Admitting it outright?"

"Valdemar stocks will crash!"

"What's her game?"

Sophia surveyed the room before continuing.

"But I have full confidence in Valdemar's medical team. He'll awaken soon."

The bespectacled reporter pressed on doggedly.

"We've heard Mr. Valdemar lost reproductive capabilities along with his consciousness?"

Henry's face darkened as he moved to intervene.

Sophia raised a restraining hand.

Her stiletto heels clicked against marble as she descended the podium steps.

"You seem unusually invested in my husband's physical condition?"

Her velvet tone carried steel beneath.

Beads of sweat formed on the reporter's forehead as he retreated half a step.

Sophia pivoted to face the camera bank.

"This press conference exists to deliver unfiltered truth."

A deliberate pause. Her gaze never wavered.

"Alexander may be comatose, but Valdemar Holdings won't falter."

Camera flashes erupted like lightning.

"I'll serve as acting CEO until his full recovery."

Henry stared at her, stunned by this masterful deflection.

The live chat sentiment shifted instantly.

"That composure! A queen!"

"Valdemar chose well with this one."

"The empire's safer than we thought..."

The bespectacled reporter's face contorted in defeat.

His fingers flew across a hidden phone screen:

"Abort plan. She's rewritten the script."
###Chapter 197

The reporter nearly dropped his voice recorder.

He had prepared a series of sharp questions to expose Sophia Laurent's lies publicly.

Yet this woman openly admitted Alexander Valdemar was in a coma.

Vincent Valdemar stood at the side of the stage, his face darkening instantly.

His carefully crafted script had been completely disrupted.

"Is she insane?" he muttered under his breath.

The live stream comments exploded.

[No way! She just admitted it?]

[Is Valdemar Holdings doomed now?]

[Wait, that was actually badass]

Sophia stood straight under the spotlight.

"Alexander is indeed in a comatose state," she stated clearly. "But doctors confirm his vital functions remain intact."

The reporters exchanged puzzled glances.

"Valdemar Holdings won't stagnate because of this." Sophia's gaze swept across the room. "The Patriarch and I will jointly oversee operations until he wakes up."

Her fingers tapped lightly on the podium.

"No matter how long it takes."

The venue fell silent.

A female reporter couldn't resist asking, "Mrs. Valdemar, why are you so candid about your husband's condition?"

Sophia's lips curved slightly.

"Secrecy only breeds more speculation." She paused. "Alexander taught me that facing problems directly is the best solution."

The live comments shifted dramatically.

[That poise is unreal]

[So much better than all the evasive types]

[Suddenly curious to see her in charge]

Vincent clenched his fists.

His planted reporter raised a hand. "Mrs. Valdemar, do you have experience managing a major corporation?"

The question cut like a blade.

Sophia regarded the questioner calmly. "I've spent a year learning at Alexander's side. Besides, Valdemar has the most professional team."

She smiled faintly.

"This reporter seems particularly concerned about my qualifications?"

The room rippled with good-natured laughter.

The reporter flushed crimson.

Just then, his phone vibrated.

A new message appeared on screen.

[Execute Plan B]
###Chapter 198

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the press conference hall.

Every camera lens focused on Sophia Laurent standing at center stage.

"Mrs. Valdemar, is it true you and Mr. Valdemar were complete strangers before his accident?" A bespectacled male reporter shouted abruptly. "Were you just a healing marriage pawn chosen by Patriarch Valdemar?"

The room fell silent.

Sophia's slender fingers tapped lightly against the microphone. A faint smile played on her lips.

"Sir, I suggest you get your prescription checked." Her voice carried icy clarity. "Alexander and I had a longstanding engagement arranged by both families."

Soft laughter rippled through the audience.

The reporter's face flushed crimson. "Reliable sources confirm you'd never met before the wedding."

Sophia's gaze turned glacial.

"Your definition of 'reliable' needs recalibration." She leaned forward slightly. "Shall I show you our engagement photos?"

The man visibly faltered.

"But... the healing marriage..."

"It's the twenty-first century." Sophia cut him off. "Do you still believe in such superstitions?"

Applause erupted in the hall.

Valdemar Group's PR director immediately stepped forward. "Please limit questions to corporate matters."

Other journalists shot disapproving looks.

"I'm pursuing journalistic integrity!" The reporter blustered. "Mrs. Valdemar's evasion suggests guilt!"

Sophia suddenly smiled.

She descended the stage with measured steps, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"You're so invested in my personal affairs..." She stopped directly before the man. "Perhaps you'd like to explain that check in your jacket pocket first?"

The reporter paled, instinctively clutching his suit pocket.

Gasps filled the room.

Camera flashes immediately targeted his retreating figure.

"I-I don't know what you're talking about!" He stammered.

Sophia turned gracefully, her hair swirling in a perfect arc.

"Ladies and gentlemen." She reclaimed the microphone. "Valdemar Group reserves full legal rights against defamation."

Security personnel already advanced toward the panicked reporter.

"Mrs. Valdemar! You can't do this!" He shouted desperately.

Without turning back, Sophia walked toward the exit, tossing one final remark over her shoulder:

"Next time you take bribes, choose a less obvious pocket."
###Chapter 199

Sophia Laurent's gaze turned sharp as a blade, piercing straight through the reporter. The smile vanished from her lips.

Her commanding presence filled the room as she spoke in an icy tone. "Valdemar Group's legal department will file a lawsuit against you for provocation. Save your explanations for the police."

Before the words fully settled, two black-suited security guards moved to restrain the journalist.

The press conference fell into dead silence. No one dared speak up for the rude reporter.

Live comments exploded:
"Mrs. Valdemar is absolutely fierce!"
"That's how you deal with unethical media!"
"The Patriarch chose well!"

The reporter's face drained of color, his legs trembling.

In his fifteen-year career, taking bribes to harass people had been routine. But this was the first time he'd met his match.

"I...I was just asking normal questions!" His voice shook.

Sophia gave a contemptuous laugh. "Filing lawsuits is my prerogative."

She gestured to the guards. "Take him away."

This incident left the remaining reporters cowed into silence.

The reputation of Valdemar's legal team was enough to make anyone think twice.

The press conference resumed its proper course.

Henry Chamberlain stood in the back, his shirt soaked with cold sweat.

When Sophia uttered the words "vegetative state," he'd nearly rushed the stage.

This completely violated the Patriarch's instructions.

Yet miraculously, Sophia had stabilized the situation.

Reporters' questions shifted to company matters:
"The Patriarch is over seventy. Can he really shoulder the entire group?"
"Love is touching, but business is war. Are you truly qualified?"

Sophia's lips curved slightly as she answered clearly:
"I graduated from Kyoto University's Business Administration program. Rest assured, I will protect Valdemar Group alongside the Patriarch until Alexander awakens..."
###Chapter 200

The girl stood under the spotlight, her delicate features resembling a painting. A faint smile played on her lips as her clear voice echoed through the venue.

Camera flashes erupted like fireworks. Reporters frantically clicked their shutters. The live stream chat exploded instantly.

"Business Administration at Imperial University? Isn't that the most competitive program in the country?"

"Beauty and brains—she's truly blessed."

"No wonder she married Alexander Valdemar. That poise screams old money."

"Wait... Doesn't she look like that viral pop star?"

Reporters immediately seized upon the online speculation. One boldly raised a microphone.

"Mrs. Valdemar, are you actually Composer T?"

Sophia Laurent gave a slight nod, her eyes glinting mischievously. "Indeed. The very same Sophia Laurent you're thinking of."

The room erupted.

Every journalist recognized that name. From the Lowell family scandal to her identity as Composer T being revealed, then the "Empress" investment—each event had dominated headlines.

Who could have imagined the woman behind these sensational stories would appear at a Valdemar Group press conference?

Live stream viewership skyrocketed, nearly crashing the servers.

"Oh my God! Composer T is Mrs. Valdemar?"

"Where are those trolls who claimed she slept her way to the top?"

"Imperial University valedictorian. Valdemar matriarch. This is next-level perfection."

The chat scrolled wildly, though skepticism surfaced too.

"Managing corporations and composing music require completely different skill sets."

"Can someone so young really helm the Valdemar empire?"

Sophia surveyed the room calmly before lifting the microphone. Her slender fingers gleamed under the lights.

"Regarding my qualifications..."

She paused deliberately, lips curving into an enigmatic smile.
###Chapter 201

The reporters exchanged glances, their recording devices still held at the ready.

Their questions grew increasingly pointed, each one wrapped in a veneer of politeness.

"Mrs. Valdemar, at such a young age, are you truly capable of shouldering the responsibilities of Valdemar Holdings?"

"Rumor has it you never graduated from university. Will the board of directors respect your authority?"

Sophia Laurent stood under the glaring lights, a faint smile playing on her lips.

"The company I founded during my time at Kyoto University has already gone public," she paused, "Managing Valdemar Holdings won't be difficult for me."

The room fell so silent you could hear a pin drop.

The live stream's chat exploded.

"Liar! Who believes this nonsense?"

"Started a business at eighteen? Yeah, right!"

"Must be some small company her family set up to make her look good!"

A reporter discreetly turned on his recording device.

A bespectacled male journalist suddenly rose to his feet.

"Mrs. Valdemar, would you mind disclosing the name of this company you founded?"

Behind his glasses, his eyes gleamed with calculation.

It was a trap.

Answering—or refusing to—would both give them ammunition.

Sophia adjusted her cuff with a graceful motion.

"Pearl Entertainment," she said clearly. "I'm the majority shareholder and CEO."

The venue plunged into stunned silence.

Even the live chat froze for several seconds.

"Pearl... as in the billion-dollar Pearl Entertainment?"

"Founded five years ago... the timeline matches..."

"Oh my god, she's the real mastermind behind it?"

The reporters gaped at each other, their pens forgotten mid-sentence.

The questioning journalist's face drained of color.
###Chapter 202

The Pearl Group might not match the Valdemar family's deep-rooted legacy, but as a rising publicly traded company, its explosive growth had already captured the industry's attention.

Live comments flooded the stream instantly.

"Oh my god! She's actually the founder of Pearl Group!"

"This plot twist is insane!"

"No wonder Pearl Group always supported Sophia Laurent!"

Investors finally breathed a sigh of relief.

"With Mrs. Valdemar at the helm, Valdemar Holdings' stock is stable now."

"Patriarch Valdemar's judgment was spot-on!"

"We can hold our shares without worry."

Viewership surpassed ten million as comments snowballed across the screen.

Vincent Valdemar stood in the shadows, his face dark with fury.

His meticulously planned scheme had been effortlessly dismantled by Sophia.

The journalists who'd accepted his bribes now asked polite questions, too intimidated to cause trouble.

"Damn it!"

His fists clenched until nails dug into his palms.

What should have been his moment to establish authority had become Sophia's triumph.

Worst of all, she'd hidden her identity as Pearl Group's founder all along.

At center stage, Sophia moved with effortless grace, every gesture radiating executive authority.

"Thank you for your concern, members of the press."

Her calm smile swept across the room.

"Valdemar Holdings continues normal operations. Stay tuned for our progress."

Inside Winston Corporation's executive office...

Ethan Winston stared at the screen, fingers trembling uncontrollably.

"So that's how it is..."

A bitter laugh escaped him, eyes filled with regret.

As Pearl Group's founder, Sophia commanded immense influence in business circles.

Had he known earlier...

Why would he have settled for an arranged marriage?

What was Isabella Evans compared to her?

Thunderous applause erupted at the press conference.

Sophia bowed gracefully before exiting amid camera flashes.

She had flawlessly resolved the crisis.
###Chapter 203

Ethan Winston's phone screen lit up with a breaking news notification. The live feed showed the Valdemar Group press conference.

Sophia Laurent stood at the center of the frame.

She wore a tailored white suit with the Valdemar insignia pinned to her lapel. The diamond ring on her left hand glittered under the spotlights.

The words "Mrs. Valdemar" stabbed through Ethan's heart like a blade.

He slammed the phone face down on his desk.

Just a month ago, Sophia had flown to Switzerland to commission a custom birthday gift for him.

That Patek Philippe watch worth millions still sat in the brand's vault.

Ethan's fingers tapped restlessly against the mahogany surface.

His gaze fell on the calendar.

Only twenty-seven days had passed since his birthday party.

"Impossible..."

He stood abruptly, knocking over his coffee cup.

Dark liquid seeped across important documents, but he didn't notice.

A terrible thought struck him.

Sophia must have been forced into this.

The Valdemars must have used some underhanded tactic.

Ethan grabbed his suit jacket and stormed out.

His secretary jumped at his sudden movement.

"Mr. Winston, the board meeting starts in ten—"

"Cancel it!"

He stabbed the elevator button without looking back.

At the press conference, reporters hurled questions like tidal waves.

"Mrs. Valdemar, how did you and Mr. Valdemar meet?"

"Sources say Mr. Valdemar remains comatose. Any comment?"

Sophia stood poised under the blinding lights, her smile perfectly calibrated.

"Thank you for your concern."

Her voice remained measured.

"Alexander and I were introduced through family connections. As for his health, you can see he's recovering well."

Henry Chamberlain wiped his sweaty palms backstage.

He'd expected this event to be a disaster.

Yet Sophia had defused the crisis with effortless grace.

Live comments flooded the stream:

[Mrs. Valdemar's presence is unreal!]
[That face was made for the Valdemar heir]
[Wasn't she the Lowell heiress before?]

Henry exhaled in relief.

He pulled out his phone and texted the hospital:

"Prepare to play the press conference footage."

One hour later.

In the VIP suite of Valdemar Sanatorium, Henry propped a tablet beside Alexander's bed.

"Sir, you must see how brilliantly the young madam handled things today."

He pressed play.

Sophia's composed face filled the screen.

"As Alexander Valdemar's wife, it's both my duty and privilege to..."

Golden sunset light spilled across the hospital sheets.

The heart monitor beeped steadily in the quiet room.
###Chapter 204

Henry Chamberlain hurried toward Alexander Valdemar's hospital room after bidding farewell to Sophia Laurent.

As Alexander's personal assistant, the security staff recognized him immediately and granted access without question.

When he pushed the door open, he found Alexander reclining against the raised hospital bed, his phone screen illuminated.

Sophia's clear voice filled the room.

"Good afternoon, members of the press. I am Alexander Valdemar's wife."

"Regarding his condition, we have never lost hope."

"Valdemar Holdings will continue normal operations. My grandfather-in-law and I will safeguard everything he's built."

"I believe he will wake up."

"Because he is the most extraordinary man I've ever known."

Henry held his breath.

The usually vigilant CEO hadn't noticed his arrival.

Even after the video ended, Alexander remained motionless.

Henry cleared his throat.

"Mr. Valdemar is handsome, brilliant..."

He deliberately mimicked Sophia's tone.

Alexander's sharp gaze snapped toward him.

A chill ran down Henry's spine.

But curiosity got the better of him.

"Sir, were you and Ms. Laurent acquainted before?"

Alexander's expression shifted slightly.

"Barely."

Their paths had crossed before.

The Patriarch had mentioned matters concerning Lowell Entertainment.

He remembered the competent chief secretary from their brief interactions.

But marriage had never crossed his mind.

Henry's eyes widened.

"But the way Ms. Laurent looked at you—"

Alexander's brows furrowed.

His original plan had been to dissolve this marriage upon recovery.

Yet Sophia's actions defied expectations.

With the Patriarch ill and Vincent Valdemar circling like a vulture, she'd stepped forward despite knowing the reporters would attack.

The image of her resolute expression in the video flashed through his mind. He closed his eyes briefly.

If she had ulterior motives, this would be simpler.

Henry recognized his superior's hesitation.

He couldn't help defending Sophia.

"Sir, Ms. Laurent truly embodies what a Mrs. Valdemar should be."

"You should have seen how she silenced those reporters—"

"Enough." Alexander's icy tone cut through the air.

He'd watched every second of that press conference.

"...Understood."
###Chapter 205

Henry immediately fell silent when he sensed Alexander's foul mood.

The office plunged into brief silence.

"The press conference exceeded expectations," Henry ventured cautiously. "Those old foxes on the board must be sweating now."

Alexander tapped the desk with his slender fingers, his gaze icy. "Proceed as planned."

"Understood." Henry nodded before adding, "We've made progress in locating Miss Tiffany Morrison. We should have concrete leads within a month."

Alexander's eyes flickered slightly. He merely gave a noncommittal hum.

Memories of that business gala three months ago resurfaced.

Sebastian had drugged him. The hotel surveillance was tampered with. Only a blurry name remained as a clue.

With countless girls named Tiffany Morrison across the country, the search had been painstakingly slow.

Henry sighed inwardly.

Now that Sophia was in the picture, he secretly hoped this search would lead nowhere.

Sophia was not only exceptionally capable but also utterly devoted to Alexander.

Her willingness to enter a therapeutic marriage with the Valdemars spoke volumes about her sincerity.

"Mrs. Valdemar is at the sanatorium visiting the Patriarch," Henry probed. "Shall I ask her to join you?"

Alexander's mind flashed to Sophia sneaking a touch on his face earlier.

"Unnecessary." His tone came out stiffer than intended.

Henry's eyebrows shot up in surprise.

That reaction... seemed unusually intense?

"I'll check on the Patriarch then." Henry tactfully changed the subject, then added indignantly, "Your father did show up at the press conference today. Thankfully Madam intervened in time."

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. "Don't mention him."

"Right, right." Henry forced a conciliatory smile. "I'll go find Madam now."

Alexander said nothing.
###Chapter 206

The word "Mrs. Valdemar" from Henry Chamberlain echoed relentlessly in Alexander Valdemar's mind.

Sophia Laurent's poised figure under the flashing cameras lingered in his thoughts.

He rubbed his temples, forcing himself to focus elsewhere.

The greedy face of Vincent Valdemar surfaced before him.

The temperature in the hospital room seemed to plummet.

Meanwhile, Sophia had arrived at Patriarch Valdemar's ward.

After Vincent's earlier outburst, the old man looked visibly weaker.

He reclined against the pillows, staring blankly out the window.

"Grandfather, are you feeling better?"

Sophia's bright voice cut through the sterile silence like sunlight.

The Patriarch turned slowly, his clouded eyes finally focusing.

"Sophia..." His voice was hoarse.

She quickly poured him a glass of warm water.

The butler standing nearby exhaled in quiet relief.

The old man had been silent since waking—until Sophia appeared.

With the water, some color returned to the Patriarch's face.

"Thank you for today."

Sophia shook her head, her eyes crinkling. "We're family."

She remembered all his kindness—from arranging Margaret Clementson's care to defending her against the Lowells.

This man had given her the warmth of kinship she'd never known.

The Patriarch froze.

"Family" was a foreign concept in the Valdemar household.

Vincent drowned himself in debauchery. Victor Valdemar was lost in his art.

The Valdemars glittered on the surface but were ice beneath.

Looking at this radiant young woman, he felt an unfamiliar warmth in his chest.

"Yes. We're family."

His sons were disappointments, but at least the younger generation held promise.

Though even they kept him at arm's length.
###Chapter 207

Special Treatment

Patriarch Valdemar lay on the hospital bed, gazing absently at the sunlight streaming through the window.

Sophia Laurent pushed the door open gently, carrying a fresh bouquet of lilies.

"Grandfather, the doctor said your fainting spell was mainly due to emotional stress." She arranged the flowers in the vase by the bedside. "A few days of rest, and you'll be discharged."

The old man turned his head, his expression softening.

In the entire Valdemar family, only Sophia addressed him as "Grandfather" so naturally—without a trace of flattery or fear.

"Hmm." His voice was gentler than usual.

The faint floral scent filled the room. Suddenly, Patriarch Valdemar sat up straighter.

"Sophia, I want you to temporarily take over as CEO of Valdemar Holdings."

Her hands, adjusting the flower stems, stilled.

"Me?"

She recalled her promise at the press conference—merely a stopgap measure to stabilize the stock price.

Valdemar Holdings was teeming with talent. The board alone had over a dozen elites. An outsider like her would never be the logical choice.

The old man's eyes burned with conviction. "You."

A rare smile smoothed the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.

"I believe you're capable."

Sophia pressed her lips together.

She was carrying Alexander's child. Divorce was inevitable. Taking over Valdemar would only complicate things.

But with internal strife and Vincent Valdemar circling like a vulture, the family patriarch genuinely needed help.

"I..."

Seeing her hesitation, he sighed.

"If it's too much, forget it. I'll find another solution."

The resignation in his voice tugged at her heart.

"I can assist temporarily."

With Oliver Granger managing Pearl Group, she only needed to sign off periodically. Helping Valdemar weather the storm shouldn't be an issue.

Consider it repayment for the old man's kindness these past months.

When Alexander woke, this goodwill might smooth the divorce proceedings.

"Excellent!" His eyes brightened. "I'll have HR issue the notice immediately."

He paused, then added, "Come to me anytime you need guidance."

Sophia nodded.

Once committed, she would give it her all.

The patriarch studied her decisive demeanor, satisfaction growing.

Such a remarkable woman. Why couldn't she have been born a Valdemar?

After he drifted off, Sophia visited Margaret's room.

Dr. George Whitmore was just leaving.

"Ms. Laurent." The doctor adjusted his glasses. "Your patient is showing signs of regaining consciousness."

Her heart skipped.

"Truly?"

She'd worked tirelessly to treat Margaret—not just out of gratitude, but because the woman held the complete truth about the switched identities.
###Chapter 208

Dr. George Whitmore adjusted his glasses. "Spending more time talking to her could help with the awakening."

"Understood."

Sophia Laurent nodded in gratitude. As she turned to leave, she paused.

She bit her lip. "How is Alexander... doing?"

Dr. Whitmore's gaze flickered. "His brain condition is stable. Other injuries are being handled by specialists."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly.

The answer couldn't be clearer—he was still unconscious.

Leaving the consultation room, Sophia lingered in the hallway before inexplicably heading toward the VIP ward.

Just a post-meal stroll, she told herself. And perhaps a glance at that breathtaking face.

"Madam!" A bodyguard's surprised voice called from behind.

Frowning, Sophia pushed the door open.

On the hospital bed, Alexander Valdemar instantly shut his eyes at the sound of movement.

His tall frame lay motionless, encased in plaster. The overhead light cast delicate shadows across his sharply defined features.

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

His complexion seemed rosier than last week?

When she'd last seen him, his handsome face had been nearly translucent with pallor. Now, a healthy flush tinted his skin, making his striking features even more mesmerizing.

"Tsk." She couldn't help murmuring. "If this were ancient times, you'd have caused wars between royal consorts."

Alexander's breath hitched.

The sweet scent of gardenias and freesia enveloped him, sparking an absurd realization—

Was she... just after his looks?

The Valdemar genes had always been exceptional, and he'd inherited the best from both parents. In his youth, this face had brought endless trouble before eventually becoming a symbol that struck fear in others.

Lost in thought, he heard her soft sigh again. "Wake up soon..."

The trailing note carried an indescribable melancholy.

If this dragged on much longer, she'd have to discuss divorce with the Patriarch.

After all, her baby bump was becoming harder to conceal.
###Chapter 209

Sophia Laurent wanted to discuss the divorce face-to-face with Alexander Valdemar.

Alexander listened to her soft sigh, his emotions in turmoil.

Was she truly this eager for him to wake up?

He could tell her he was already conscious.

But the master strategist found himself at a loss when facing Sophia.

Maintaining this marriage was currently the most advantageous move for Valdemar Holdings.

A sudden divorce would not only crash stock prices but also shake investor confidence.

Alexander clenched his fists, never before so desperate to recover.

Unaware, Sophia continued speaking.

"Grandfather asked me to temporarily assume the role of CEO. You owe him for this favor..."

A dozen compensation plans flashed through Alexander's mind.

He couldn't give her love.

But materially, she would want for nothing.

After rambling a while longer, Sophia stood to leave.

"I'm visiting Grandfather now. Rest well."

Her footsteps faded.

The moment before the door closed, Alexander opened his eyes.

He stared at her retreating figure with profound intensity.

After leaving the hospital, Sophia visited Margaret Delaney.

That evening, she dined with Patriarch Valdemar before being driven back to Westmount Villa.

"Your official appointment begins tomorrow. Get some rest tonight."

Sophia nodded obediently.

The appointment notice had been circulated company-wide.

At dawn, Henry Chamberlain arrived in high spirits.

After breakfast, he personally drove Sophia to Valdemar Holdings' headquarters.

The glass skyscraper stood imposingly in the CBD district, its facade glittering in the morning light.

News of the leadership change had caused an uproar.

Shareholders exchanged uneasy glances during the morning meeting.

When Sophia entered the conference room, all eyes turned toward her.

Dressed in a crisp black suit with her hair in a severe bun, she cut an imposing figure.

"I'm Sophia Laurent, acting CEO."

Before she finished speaking, Director Huang slammed the table.

"A mere girl presuming to lead Valdemar?"

Others chimed in: "Can you even read financial statements? Don't embarrass yourself!"

"Resign now. This isn't some playground."

Sophia took her seat with unshaken composure.

"I won't step down until Alexander wakes up."

She met Director Huang's gaze directly. "Mind your language."

Then she scanned the room. "If anyone has business concerns, voice them now."
###Chapter 210

Chairman Huang's greasy face turned beet red in the boardroom.

He slammed his hands on the table and pointed at Sophia Laurent. "Who the hell do you think you are? How dare you lecture us?"

Sophia calmly adjusted her cuffs without even looking up.

"Mind your blood pressure, Chairman Huang."

Her casual remark only enraged him further.

"Since when does a woman run Valdemar Group?" He sneered. "Go home and take care of your kids!"

The shareholders exchanged uneasy glances. The air grew thick with tension.

Sophia suddenly smiled.

She slid a document to the center of the table.

"The Eden Project. Chairman Huang's responsibility."

The first page revealed staggering red numbers.

"Eight billion budget. One-year timeline." Sophia tapped the table. "Three billion over budget. Six months behind schedule. Only 50% completion."

Beads of sweat formed on Huang's forehead.

"Market fluctuations—"

"Really?" Sophia cut him off. "Then why was the contract awarded to your nephew's shell company?"

Gasps filled the room.

Shareholders passed the document around, their expressions darkening.

"More interesting," Sophia produced another file, "four billion additional funds were approved during Alexander's coma."

Her gaze turned razor-sharp.

"Where did that money really go?"

Huang shot up, his chair screeching across the floor.

"You're slandering me!"

Sophia pressed a remote.

Projected images showed Huang's nephew's new mansion and luxury cars.

"Three million dollar villa. Two limited edition sports cars." She smirked. "Business must be booming."

The room erupted.

"Huang Yousheng! You think we're fools?"

"No wonder you kept delaying progress reports!"

Huang's face turned ashen. His legs trembled.

Sophia stood, looking down at him.

"Now. Explain yourself."
###Chapter 211

"The Eden Project at Riverside Plaza was highly coveted by numerous competitors. Our company exerted tremendous effort to secure it." Sophia Laurent tapped her slender fingers lightly on the conference table. "Mr. Huang, is this how you embezzle company funds?"

Beads of sweat formed on Huang Yousheng's forehead.

"Don't listen to her nonsense," he forced a dry laugh. "Construction delays are common. Every project encounters unexpected issues."

"Unexpected?" A shareholder slammed the table and stood. "A year and a half, and less than half is completed. Is that just an 'issue'?"

Another shareholder smirked. "The real surprise is that the contractor happens to be your nephew, isn't it?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

Several senior shareholders exchanged glances before speaking slowly. "Huang Yousheng, you misappropriated company funds while Mr. Valdemar was in a coma. Now you're obstructing Ms. Laurent's appointment—afraid the truth will come out?"

"Ms. Laurent graduated from a prestigious university and built her own company from scratch. Her competence is undeniable."

"What exactly is your motive for making things difficult for her?"

These veterans who had fought alongside Patriarch Valdemar now stood firmly behind Sophia.

Huang Yousheng paled but managed a strained smile. "Give me six more months. I guarantee completion."

The shareholders hesitated.

Then Sophia's cool voice cut through the tension. "I'm afraid that won't be possible, Mr. Huang."

She raised her phone, displaying a police investigation notice on the screen.

"You're suspected of occupational embezzlement. The authorities have already launched an inquiry." Her gaze swept across the room. "Pending investigation, you are hereby suspended from all duties."

Silence fell over the conference room.

Every eye was fixed on the composed young woman in astonishment.
###Chapter 212

The business world is a battlefield where no one dares show their hand too soon.

Sophia Laurent had barely arrived at Valdemar Holdings when she stirred up a storm. Her audacity turned heads.

Didn't she know the consequences of making enemies?

The Valdemar Group was riddled with factions. By targeting Raymond Huang, she risked setting off a chain reaction.

Raymond Huang stood frozen, his fingers trembling slightly.

"You want to take over the Eden Project?"

Sophia remained calm, her gaze sharp. "Correct. Until the police complete their investigation into the missing 1.1 billion, I'll be overseeing it."

She paused, then added, "Don't worry, Mr. Huang. Your personal freedom won't be restricted during the inquiry."

Raymond's face darkened instantly.

"Sophia! Do you realize you're playing with fire?"

He gritted his teeth. "Targeting a senior executive on your first day—are you trying to destabilize the entire company?"

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

"You misunderstand, Mr. Huang. I'm simply following protocol."

"Those who truly care about Valdemar will welcome this. After all..."

Her eyes swept the room. "No one wants parasites eating away at our collective interests, do they?"

A vein throbbed in Raymond's forehead.

"I can provide full accounting records! Don't let this little girl deceive you—"

Sophia chuckled softly.

"Such resistance to a professional audit... Is there something you're hiding, Mr. Huang?"

The boardroom fell silent.

Several shareholders who had been ready to defend Raymond quietly stepped back.

The Eden Project had an 800 million budget. Seven hundred million had been spent, yet less than half the work was completed. After Alexander Valdemar's coma, another 400 million was injected.

The irregularities were obvious.

But what truly unsettled them was this seemingly delicate woman's preparedness.

Sophia had studied dossiers on every key Valdemar executive until dawn.

She knew every shareholder in that room intimately.

Raymond Huang was merely her first warning shot.

With Patriarch Valdemar aging and Alexander comatose, oversight had slipped.

The Eden Project was the biggest loophole.

And Raymond Huang had walked right into her crosshairs.

"This is slander!" Raymond turned desperately to the other shareholders. "Someone speak sense here!"
###Chapter 213

"You're letting this little girl kick me out today? You'll regret this."

Most shareholders had already sided with Sophia Laurent.

If Raymond Huang was truly innocent, why was he so panicked?

Several shareholders who had previously supported Sophia now spoke up with pleasant smiles.

"Raymond, consider it a short vacation. The project will still be yours once the investigation concludes."

"Exactly. As long as the funds check out, you'll remain in charge."

Raymond Huang listened to their seemingly supportive yet firm insistence on the investigation, his chest tightening with rage.

His gaze darkened as he glared at Sophia, eyes glinting with malice.

"Do you know who I am?"

"I was building this empire with Patriarch Valdemar when you were still playing in the mud!"

"Even Alexander Valdemar treats me with respect. Who the hell do you think you are?"

Sophia's smile vanished, her aura turning razor-sharp.

"I am currently the acting CEO of Valdemar Holdings, with full authority over all company matters."

She met his glare without flinching. "Until the police investigation is complete, Mr. Huang, you are on leave."

Her clear, decisive tone cut through the room like a blade, sending a chill down everyone's spine.

For a moment, the shareholders saw a glimpse of Alexander when he first took the reins—
relentless and fearless.

The young couple shared the same commanding presence.

After security escorted Raymond Huang out, no one dared challenge Sophia again.

The meeting proceeded smoothly as department heads delivered their reports.

Henry Chamberlain watched the orderly proceedings with quiet surprise.

He had expected a bloodbath today.

Yet Sophia had struck at the heart of the matter with precision.

No wonder she had meticulously reviewed the shareholder profiles yesterday.

What he assumed was routine preparation turned out to be a calculated move—
taking down the loudest troublemaker first.

Though a minor player, Raymond's dismissal sent a clear warning to the old foxes.

Henry's gaze lingered on the composed young woman at the head of the table, admiration swelling in his chest.

No wonder Patriarch Valdemar had chosen her as his heir's wife.

Her effortless poise—confident yet understated—was nothing short of awe-inspiring.

The meeting stretched from dawn until midday.

Sophia reviewed every report before closing the session with a final nod.
###Chapter 214

After the meeting, Henry Chamberlain escorted Sophia Laurent to Alexander Valdemar's office.

The office occupied the penthouse floor. Its monochrome palette exuded austerity, every object placed with military precision.

Floor-to-ceiling windows framed the sprawling cityscape below.

"Madam, I'll attend to other matters. Please ring if you need anything."

"Very well."

Sophia arranged the documents neatly on the desk and began reviewing them with focused intensity.

Henry closed the door softly behind him, leaving the space in hushed stillness.

Sunlight streamed through the glass walls, warming the cool-toned interior.

Time slipped by unnoticed until Sophia rubbed her tired eyes, preparing to stretch her stiff limbs.

The office door burst open without warning.

"Well, well. So this is the lucky charm my brother married?"

Sophia lifted her gaze, calmly assessing the intruder.

A young man with electric blue hair and platinum streaks lounged in the doorway. His floral shirt and shorts screamed tropical vacation.

"And you are?"

"Tsk." He cocked an eyebrow dramatically. "You don't recognize me?"

Sophia maintained a polite but distant smile. "Should I?"

"Alright then." He sauntered in and perched on the desk edge. "Remember this - Adrian Valdemar."

"I see." Her response was glacial.

Adrian Valdemar - the polar opposite of his brother Alexander.

Where Alexander was a business titan, Adrian dominated tabloid headlines. His revolving door of romantic entanglements, both male and female, made him society's most notorious playboy.

Sophia knew the rumors but had never met him in person.

Her indifference only fueled Adrian's amusement. He leaned closer. "You're much prettier than those plastic influencers..."

Sophia's brow furrowed.

"Since my brother's still playing Sleeping Beauty, what's in this for you?"

"None of your concern."

"Oh, but it is." His smirk turned salacious. "I've got a soft spot for beauties. Why not ditch him for me?"

Before she could respond, he waved a dismissive hand. "Not marriage, obviously. But we could start with dating..."

Sophia shoved her chair back and stood abruptly.

"Adrian, I'm your sister-in-law."

"Exactly." He winked. "There's something thrilling about corrupting my stick-in-the-mud brother's wife."
###Chapter 215

Sophia Laurent lifted her gaze, her eyes like ice daggers piercing the man at the door.

"Get out."

Her voice was colder than frozen steel.

Adrian Valdemar leaned against the doorframe, a smirk playing on his lips.

"So hostile, sister-in-law."

He jingled his car keys.

"Let me take you somewhere fun."

Sophia didn't even glance up.

"Not interested."

Adrian strode to her desk and slammed his palm over the documents she was reviewing.

"If you refuse..."

He deliberately drew out his words.

"I'll tear these all up."

Sophia finally looked up.

She studied him for three long seconds before smiling.

"Adrian, don't you have anything better to do?"

She capped her fountain pen with deliberate slowness.

"Shall I call the psychiatric hospital for you?"

Adrian shrugged, unfazed.

"You're even prettier when you're angry."

He leaned closer.

"How about—"

Sophia shot to her feet.

"Adrian."

Her voice was soft but carried undeniable authority.

"Does your brother know you're this idle?"

Adrian's smirk froze.

Sophia seized the moment to circle her desk.

"Right now. Immediately. Without delay."

She enunciated each word.

"Get. Out."

Adrian quickly recovered his roguish grin.

"So cruel."

He pouted theatrically.

"I just wanted to—"

Sophia suddenly grabbed a folder from her desk.

Whack!

The folder struck Adrian's head with a sharp crack.

"Ow!"

He clutched his forehead.

"You—"

Sophia had already unbuckled her belt.

"You want to play?"

She flicked the belt with a cold laugh.

"Let's play properly."

The leather cut through the air with a menacing hiss.

"Ah!"

Adrian yelped in pain.

He hadn't expected her to actually strike him.

"Crazy woman!"

He dodged while cursing.

"Do you know who I am?"

Sophia ignored him, each lash more vicious than the last.

"Stop! Enough!"

Adrian scrambled away in panic.

"I surrender! I was wrong!"

Sophia finally lowered the belt.

She fastened it back around her waist with elegant precision.

"Leaving now?"

Adrian rubbed his reddened arm, teeth clenched.

"This isn't over!"

He spat the threat before fleeing in disgrace.

The office door slammed shut behind him.

Sophia returned to her seat without expression.

She picked up her pen and resumed reviewing documents.

As if nothing had happened.
###Chapter 216

Adrian Valdemar never expected this delicate-looking beauty would suddenly attack.

The whip cracked through the air, making him shudder.

As the youngest Valdemar heir, he'd grown up undisciplined but never physically punished.

A searing pain spread across his back.

"Stop! Do you know who I am?" Adrian growled through clenched teeth.

Sophia Laurent responded with a casual hum.

Her wrist flicked, sending the belt down again with brutal force.

"Crazy woman! Henry! Help me!"

Adrian dodged clumsily but couldn't escape the relentless strikes.

Sophia deliberately avoided his face, each lash landing precisely on his body.

"Young and already rotten. You deserve this."

She paused, catching her breath.

Adrian seized the moment to retreat, his back burning.

"None of your damn business! Who do you think you are?"

He glared defiantly.

Sophia smirked and raised the belt again.

"Shit!"

Adrian scrambled like a frightened rat.

"Are you insane? Attacking me out of nowhere?"

The belt struck his thigh mercilessly.

"Say it again. Who am I?"

"Just some healing marriage pawn!"

Two sharp cracks echoed.

"Who am I?"

"You fucking—"

Another two lashes.

"Fine! I surrender!"

Adrian bolted toward the door but Sophia blocked his path.

The belt snapped menacingly in her grip.

"You haven't answered my question."

Adrian trembled.

"Sister-in-law! You're my sister-in-law!"

He spat the words through gritted teeth.

Returning home, he'd only wanted to see what kind of woman his brother married.

Beautiful, yes.

But terrifying.

He'd make her pay once his bodyguards arrived!

Sophia heard the resentment in his voice but stepped aside.

"Remember what you just said."

She coiled the belt, her gaze piercing.
###Chapter 217

Adrian Valdemar's face darkened in silence.

The office door suddenly swung open.

Henry Chamberlain entered with a stack of files.

He froze mid-step at the scene before him.

Adrian's eyes lit up as if spotting a lifeline.

"Henry! Get this madwoman out of here!"

Henry's gaze landed on the belt in Sophia Laurent's hand.

"Madam, what's going on?"

The Sophia he knew was always gentle. Violence was unlike her.

Sophia smirked coldly.

"Your young master insists on dragging me to a bar."

Henry's brow furrowed slightly.

"Young master, you're..."

Adrian cut him off impatiently.

"Stop wasting time! Call security!"

Henry sighed.

"Young master, Madam is currently the acting CEO of Valdemar Holdings."

Adrian scoffed.

"On what merit? She must have tricked Grandfather!"

Henry's expression turned stern.

"Mind your words."

He changed tack.

"Aren't you supposed to be on set right now?"

Adrian stiffened.

"That trash production isn't worthy of me."

Henry's frown deepened.

"You walked off set again?"

Adrian shrugged carelessly.

"Let someone else play the role!"

Henry took a deep breath.

"How do you plan to explain this to the Patriarch?"

Adrian snorted.

"Grandfather has better things to do than worry about such trivial matters."

"What about the breach fee?"

Adrian answered without hesitation.

"That's why I'm here—to get it from you."

Henry was speechless.

"Master Alexander did instruct me to..."

But this was already the third time this month.

Adrian treated acting like a whim—coming and going as he pleased.

Henry recalled this was merely a supporting role.

"Perhaps you should return and finish filming?"

Adrian's refusal was absolute.

"Not a chance!"

Henry massaged his temples.
###Chapter 218

Henry Chamberlain's brow furrowed as his fingers tapped lightly on the desk.

He finally sighed. "Fine. I'll go to the finance department and prepare the transfer documents."

Adrian Valdemar's lips curled into a smug smirk as he shot Sophia Laurent a challenging look.

"Wait." Sophia's voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Henry's hand froze mid-air.

Adrian's face paled, a cold sweat breaking out on his back. "What now?"

Sophia's red lips curved into a smile. "Good guess."

Her bright expression sent a chill down Adrian's spine.

"Henry, ignore her!" Adrian snapped, hopping in agitation.

Sophia spoke calmly. "I don't approve this transfer."

Henry stood rooted to the spot.

"You have no right!" Adrian exploded.

"As Mrs. Valdemar, I do." Sophia twirled a pen between her fingers. "Half that money is mine."

Adrian's face turned livid. "That's my brother's money!"

"And now it's mine too." Sophia lifted her gaze. "Don't forget—I'm also Valdemar Group's acting CEO."

Her cold eyes flickered over the spoiled young heir before her.

Adrian Valdemar, the family's reckless playboy, squandering his days in extravagance.

Now that he'd crossed her path, she wouldn't let him off easy.

Adrian suddenly lunged forward. "I'll kill you!"

Sophia flicked her wrist, sending a leather belt whistling through the air.

Adrian skidded to a halt, his face ashen.

"Watch your language," Sophia said icily.

"Mind your own damn business!" Adrian spat.

Sophia turned to Henry. "Where does his allowance come from?"

Henry blinked. "The Patriarch gives him two million monthly. He also has a supplementary card from Mr. Valdemar with the same limit."

"Four million—gone in half a month?" Sophia arched a brow.

Adrian jutted his chin. "None of your concern!"

Sophia smiled. "From now on, both cards are frozen."

Henry's eyes widened.
###Chapter 219

Adrian Valdemar's pupils constricted violently.

The gravity of the situation finally dawned on him.

"Have you lost your mind? That's Valdemar money I'm spending!" He screamed hysterically. "You vicious woman—are you trying to steal our family fortune?"

Sophia Laurent didn't even bother looking up. "Henry, call security."

She knew Adrian's weakness all too well.

The spoiled young master feared nothing more than losing his financial lifeline.

Adrian's face froze.

"You're kicking me out?" He pointed at himself in disbelief.

"Any objections?" Sophia settled gracefully into her leather chair. "Company policy prohibits disturbances during executive hours."

"You bitch! This isn't over!"

Adrian lunged toward the desk.

Henry Chamberlain intercepted him with lightning reflexes.

"Compose yourself, young master. Let's discuss this outside."

"Compose myself?" Adrian struggled violently. "That viper doesn't deserve to be Alexander's wife!"

He was half-dragged from the office.

"Just wait! I'm telling Grandfather about this!"

Sophia lifted her coffee cup with a radiant smile.

"My door is always open."

Adrian trembled with rage, still hurling insults as the elevator doors closed.

"Who does she think she is? How dare she freeze my cards!"

Henry offered a handkerchief. "Madam is upset. Perhaps revisit this in a few days—"

"Bullshit!"

Adrian shoved up his sleeves.

"Look what that lunatic did!"

Henry inhaled sharply.

Angry red welts crisscrossed the young man's pale skin.

A flicker of admiration crossed Henry's eyes.

Conventional wisdom dictated new brides should curry favor with their husband's siblings.

Yet she had...

Henry masked his expression. "Madam has always been reasonable. If you'd just—"

Adrian narrowed his eyes.

"Were you smiling just now, Henry?"

"Certainly not!" Henry stiffened. "Shall we consult the Patriarch about the breach fees?"
###Chapter 220

Adrian Valdemar deflated instantly after hearing Henry Chamberlain's warning.

"Let's not... It's just a trivial matter. No need to bother Grandfather..."

Henry saw right through his unease and responded flatly, "Hmm."

"How do you plan to handle the breach fee?"

Adrian hesitated. "Didn't you say you could issue me a certificate?"

Henry frowned. "But... the CEO just explicitly ordered me not to."

Adrian's eyes widened. "What?"

"What kind of CEO is she? You're the executive assistant, second only to my brother in the company. Why listen to her?"

Suppressing a laugh at his outburst, Henry said, "She is my direct superior now, appointed by the Patriarch himself. Maybe... you should take it up with him?"

Adrian rolled his eyes. "If I dared approach the Patriarch, would I be here begging you?"

"Then what?" Henry spread his hands. "I have to follow her orders unless I want to lose my job. You understand."

Adrian gritted his teeth. "That woman is ruthless."

Suddenly, his eyes lit up. "How about... you lend me some money?"

Henry sighed. "Young Master, you overestimate me. If I had two million in savings, why would I still be working?"

Adrian looked shocked. "My brother pays you that little?"

Henry chuckled. "Young Master, my annual salary is already top-tier in the industry. It's just that your financial perspective differs from ordinary people's."

This sheltered young master could casually squander two million on a breach fee—what did he know about the struggles of earning money?

After a long silence, Adrian finally said, "Forget it. I'll figure it out myself."

At worst, he'd just finish filming that awful drama.

So what if people mocked him?

As Henry watched Adrian leave, an inexplicable pang of sympathy struck him.

He shook his head.

An illusion. It had to be.

How could this pampered young master possibly be pitiable?

Still...

Was cutting off his financial support really the right move?

The kid did seem genuinely distressed...

After all these years in the entertainment industry, he'd gained nothing but infamy...

Henry lingered at the door for a moment before knocking on Sophia Laurent's office again.

Inside, Sophia was browsing through Adrian's gossip headlines.

The more she read, the more appalled she became.

Compared to other wealthy heirs like Nathan Lowell and Christopher Lowell, Adrian's reputation was abysmal.

The internet mercilessly mocked him:

"Worst actor alive."

"More temper than talent."

"Professional diva."

"Plastic-faced pretty boy."

The most ridiculous was the plastic surgery rumor.

With the Valdemar family's impeccable genes, surgeons probably used their features as reference models.

What surprised her most was that despite the relentless criticism, Adrian had never once flaunted his family background.

In the entertainment world, he was notorious for:

Assaulting reporters.

Envying peers with fans.

Sabotaging others' fan events.

In short, his name was synonymous with scandal.
###Chapter 221

Adrian Valdemar's acting clips went viral online.

Those exaggerated memes were wildly shared by netizens.

His wide-eyed and pouty screenshots were captioned with hilarious texts.

The comment section was flooded with laughter.

Sophia Laurent tapped her fingers on the desk, staring at the computer screen.

Adrian's career history gave her a headache—five years in the industry with zero notable works.

Yet his scandals piled up like a mountain.

A knock interrupted her thoughts.

Henry Chamberlain entered just as she switched the computer screen.

"Madam."

"What is it?"

Henry hesitated. "About the young master's allowance... Mr. Valdemar never interfered before."

Sophia frowned slightly. "Suspend it for now."

The Valdemars could certainly afford it, but Adrian's behavior had crossed the line.

Henry took the hint and excused himself.

The office fell silent again as Sophia continued reviewing Adrian's file.

In the entertainment circle, Adrian was infamous as a playboy.

He changed girlfriends more frequently than his clothes—from influencers to D-list celebrities, none were spared.

Those million-dollar watches and limited-edition sports cars served as his best "calling cards."

Though ridiculed online, Adrian earned a notorious nickname in the industry—"The Generous Casanova."

His lavish breakup settlements kept his exes from badmouthing him.

Sophia opened the shooting schedule for "Love You Forever."

Coincidentally, it was filmed at the same studio as "Empress."

She closed her laptop, deciding to visit the set tomorrow.

The stack of documents on her desk reminded her of Valdemar Group's backlog.

With the aging Patriarch Valdemar, many matters had been neglected.

Sophia picked up the top report and began reviewing it meticulously.

Meanwhile, Henry was en route to the sanatorium.

He clutched the surveillance footage copied from the security room.

The recording showed Adrian's arrogant demeanor, making Henry shake his head.

Though the Patriarch ruled with an iron fist, Alexander had always indulged his younger brother.

Henry needed to report this in advance to avoid future misunderstandings.

The crisp sound of a slap echoed sharply from the video.

Henry couldn't help but wince—Madam's strike was merciless.
###Chapter 222

Henry Chamberlain pushed open the doors of Valdemar Sanatorium.

Patriarch Valdemar sat by the floor-to-ceiling windows, enjoying his lunch.

Sunlight streamed through the glass, illuminating the dining table. The old man picked up a piece of braised pork and chewed slowly.

He already knew everything about the company's recent developments.

He had thought Sophia Laurent would barely manage against the cunning old foxes.

But she hadn't just survived—she'd turned the tables and taken control of the company.

A flawless victory.

As for her management skills, time would tell.

Her boldness and strategy had impressed him.

His spirits had visibly improved. He'd already asked for two extra servings.

"Henry, you're here?" The patriarch set down his chopsticks with a smile.

Seeing the healthy flush on the old man's face, Henry exhaled in relief.

It had been a long time since the patriarch looked this content—not since Alexander's accident.

They chatted about company affairs for a while. Then, after hesitating, Henry brought up Adrian.

"Sir, there's something I need to report."

He recounted Adrian's harassment of Sophia at the office, including every arrogant word.

He even played the surveillance footage from his phone.

Adrian's lewd behavior was unmistakable.

The patriarch's expression darkened instantly.

"That disgrace!"

His chopsticks slammed onto the table, rattling the dishes.

"Skipping business school to become an actor! Years in the industry with nothing to show for it, and now he's picked up his father's womanizing ways!"

His beard trembled with rage. "Good! Alexander spoiled him rotten!"

Henry remained silent.

The young master was indeed outrageous. Fooling around was one thing, but drugging his own brother?

All because he "couldn't stand seeing his brother live like a eunuch."

If it were up to Henry, he'd have broken the boy's legs long ago.

Adrian had fled abroad that very night, clearly guilty.

No one could have predicted Alexander's sudden accident.

Still fuming, the patriarch stormed into the adjacent hospital room.

Alexander lay motionless on the bed, his breathing steady.

"Look what your indulgence has done!"

The patriarch jabbed a finger at the bed. "Every time I tried to discipline him, you stopped me! Now he's harassing your wife!"

"Thank God she has sense and put him in his place. Otherwise, that brat would've gone completely out of control!"

His shouts echoed through the room, met only by the steady beep of the heart monitor.

Exhausted, the patriarch finally left.

Once the footsteps faded, Henry cleared his throat. "Mr. Valdemar, he's gone."

The man on the bed opened his eyes.

His dark gaze was sharp as a blade. The temperature in the room seemed to drop.

"Explain."

Henry repeated the incident and handed over his phone.

Watching Adrian's crude behavior, Alexander's brow furrowed.

When he heard the vulgar remarks, his expression turned stormy.

His brother was long overdue for discipline.
###Chapter 223

Alexander's gaze turned icy as he watched the surveillance footage.

The audacious young man in the video had dared to disrespect his wife.

Even after being rejected, the fool persisted with threats and harassment.

Utter lawlessness.

His attention shifted to the woman wielding a leather belt.

Her tailored suit was immaculate, every hair perfectly in place.

The way she swung the belt was precise and graceful, exuding a lethal elegance.

Alexander arched an eyebrow.

He was accustomed to delicate socialites, not this kind of formidable woman.

It was... intriguing.

But Adrian's pained screams snapped him back to reality.

Though troublesome, this younger brother was his responsibility.

Vincent Valdemar had been a philandering father who neglected his lawful wife and heir.

His mother, shattered by betrayal, succumbed to mental illness.

Sweet as honey in her lucid moments, but a raving lunatic during episodes.

His childhood echoed with paternal indifference and maternal hysteria.

At least he'd tasted fleeting maternal warmth.

Adrian... had never been wanted.

Alexander still remembered that stormy night - his mother's hands around the infant's throat.

He'd fought desperately to save that tiny life.

His reasoning had been simple - a brother would ease the loneliness.

With the Patriarch preoccupied by business, Adrian became his charge.

Perhaps his indulgence had fostered such recklessness.

"Mr. Valdemar..." Henry ventured cautiously, "Madam already gave Young Master Adrian a chance."

Alexander shot him a glacial look.

"Too much free time?"

Henry awkwardly rubbed his nose.

He'd expected outrage from this notorious brother-protector, not this calm detachment.

Alexander forwarded the video to his phone and tossed the device aside.

The frozen image showed Sophia mid-lash.

That striking poise lingered in his mind.
###Chapter 224

Henry Chamberlain's ears burned under Alexander Valdemar's questioning. His fingers unconsciously fiddled with his suit cuff.

"Ahem..." He cleared his throat. "I was just curious... How do you feel about Madam disciplining Young Master Adrian?"

Alexander's knuckles rapped twice on the desk.

What could he say?

Adrian Valdemar needed discipline.

Yet his grip on the fountain pen tightened slightly at the sound of those pained cries.

"Let her be."

Henry stole a glance at his boss's tense jawline.

"Should we assign someone to follow Young Master Adrian?" He lowered his voice. "Just in case he..."

Alexander's sharp gaze cut him off.

"Make it happen."

Sophia Laurent handed the last document to her assistant as the clock struck noon.

She rubbed her aching lower back and dialed her driver.

The Tangcheng Film Studio pass rustled softly in her bag.

The set of "Love You Forever" was located at the western edge of the studio.

Under the scorching sun, Sophia stood beneath a tree with her parasol.

A shrill reprimand pierced the air.

"Are you made of wood? Can't even play a spoiled rich kid properly?"

The female director in a floral shirt waved her script wildly. "Even extras act better than you!"

Adrian's dress shirt clung to his sweat-drenched back.

His lips pressed into a thin line, lashes casting delicate shadows in the sunlight.

Sophia's fingertip swiped across her phone screen.

A red recording light blinked to life.

The director suddenly hurled a water bottle at him.

"Again! One more screw-up and you're fired!"

The bottle grazed Adrian's temple before exploding against the concrete in a burst of water.

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

She watched as the young man silently bent to retrieve the bottle and walked toward the trash can.
###Chapter 225

The studio lights glared harshly.

Adrian Valdemar stood before the camera, beads of sweat forming at his temples.

The female director's furious voice echoed across the set. "Cut! Adrian, you're playing a spineless coward, not some martyr with unbreakable pride!"

The clapperboard snapped shut again.

This scene required the male lead to defend the female lead by confronting Adrian's character—a spoiled rich kid.

The script demanded Adrian grovel after being hit.

Yet his eyes still burned with defiance.

"Useless!" The director hurled her script to the ground. "How dare you call yourself an actor? Go home and play the young master where you belong!"

The set fell deathly silent.

Sophia Laurent stood in the shadows, her brow furrowed.

She noticed the lead actors' performances were equally stiff, yet only Adrian received such vitriol.

"Director Chen." Sophia's cool voice sliced through the tension.

The director turned with a scowl. "Who the hell are you?"

"I'm Adrian's legal guardian." Sophia stepped forward. "Why are you singling him out?"

Director Chen narrowed her eyes.

Her gaze raked over Sophia's tailored suit and striking features before smirking. "Ah, the sugar mommy finally shows up."

Whispers rippled through the crew.

"I'm his legal sister." Sophia's gaze turned razor-sharp. "Though I'm curious—if Adrian's acting is so terrible, why cast him at all?"

Director Chen's expression faltered.

Sophia advanced like a predator. "Using his fame for publicity while making him your punching bag? Clever scheme."

Crew members exchanged uneasy glances.

Someone muttered, "No wonder he gets so much hate..."

Director Chen flushed with rage. "He's terrible and you expect me to pretend otherwise?"

"Coaching actors is your job." Sophia's smile chilled the air. "Or can you only direct by screaming to hide your incompetence?"

The atmosphere turned glacial.

Adrian stood frozen, his knuckles whitening around clenched fists.

He never expected Sophia to appear.

Least of all to defend him.
###Chapter 226

Director Chen's spittle sprayed across Adrian Valdemar's face.

"Your acting is worse than a block of wood!" she shrieked, veins bulging in her neck. "You're dragging down the entire production!"

Adrian clenched his fists. His nails dug crescent moons into his palms.

He bit down hard on his lower lip, swallowing every retort.

Sophia Laurent observed the spectacle from the sidelines, her expression glacial.

She saw right through Director Chen's ploy—using Adrian's scandal to promote this low-budget drama.

"Quite the performance, Director." Sophia's stilettos clicked against the floor as she strode forward. Every head turned.

Director Chen's face paled. "And you are—"

"Family." Sophia smiled sweetly. "I hear you've been bullying my boy?"

Adrian's head snapped up. His eyes widened in disbelief.

Had she lost her mind? Since when was he her boy?

The director recovered quickly. "I was merely providing professional guidance."

"Really?" Sophia surveyed the hushed set. "Funny. I heard you're exploiting Adrian's scandal for publicity."

The air turned leaden.

Crew members exchanged knowing glances. Puzzle pieces clicked into place.

Adrian's ears burned crimson. Their pitying stares pricked like needles.

"Preposterous!" Director Chen's voice cracked. "Leave the set immediately! You're disrupting—"

"Cancel the shoot." Sophia cut her off.

She turned to Adrian. "Pack your things. We're leaving."

Adrian stood frozen.

Hadn't this woman refused to pay his breach fee just yesterday?

Director Chen sneered. "Fine. But the two million penalty stands."

"Don't worry." Sophia pulled out her phone. "Valdemar's legal team will handle the paperwork."

Her eyes narrowed. "Though I wonder if that figure would hold up in court."

All color drained from Director Chen's face.

No low-budget contract could withstand that level of scrutiny.
###Chapter 227

Director Chen's face darkened instantly, his fingers tightening around the script's edge.

"The breach fee is clearly stated in black and white. What's there to question?"

Sophia Laurent didn't even spare him a glance, striding straight toward Adrian Valdemar.

Adrian instinctively took half a step back, his Adam's apple bobbing nervously.

"W-what do you want?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow at his cowardly display, a teasing smirk playing on her lips.

"So jumpy? Afraid I'll devour you?"

Adrian stiffened his neck in defiance. "Don't be ridiculous!"

He inched backward again as he spoke.

"Freeze."

Sophia's expression suddenly turned icy. "I'll count to three. Take one more step and see what happens."

Adrian immediately rooted to the spot.

"Good boy."

Sophia nodded approvingly. "Just answer me this—how much are they paying you for this role?"

Adrian scratched his head. "Uh... twenty-eight thousand?"

The set fell dead silent.

Sophia nearly laughed in disbelief.

A top-tier celebrity taking chump change for a gig?

Even with Adrian's tarnished reputation, his star power was undeniable. A single tweet from him could trend for days.

The "Love You Forever" crew was clearly taking him for a fool.

Crew members exchanged uneasy glances. Even the greenest newcomers earned more than Adrian.

Two million in breach fees?

This was outright robbery.

Sophia turned to Director Chen with a knowing smile.

"Quite the scheme you've got, Director Chen."

She delivered the final blow leisurely. "Scam a few more artists into breaching contracts, and you won't even need box office revenue, huh?"

Director Chen's face cycled through shades of green and white.

Adrian remained frozen in place, dumbfounded.

Sophia waved impatiently.

"What are you waiting for? Let's go."

Adrian hesitated, glancing at the cameras.

"Seriously? We can just leave?"

Sophia grabbed his wrist decisively.

"Follow me."

Director Chen stomped his foot in fury.

"Adrian! You haven't finished today's scenes!"

Sophia didn't bother turning around as she waved dismissively.

"Twenty-eight thousand isn't worthy of Mr. Valdemar's acting caliber."

Director Chen screeched after them, "I'll expose you both on social media!"

Adrian suddenly spun around.

"Be my guest."

He flashed a roguish grin. "Don't forget to tag me. I'll give you a like."
###Chapter 228

Sophia Laurent ignored Director Chen's threats and strode away without looking back.

Adrian Valdemar hesitated on the spot.

Over the years, he'd grown accustomed to being mocked by the entire internet...

But who enjoyed being constantly criticized?

Seeing Sophia show no intention of stopping, he reluctantly followed.

Whatever!

One more humiliation wouldn't kill him.

Though he detested this woman, her earlier defense of him had been... unexpectedly impressive.

Not that he'd ever thank her for it.

If she hadn't interfered, he could've just paid the penalty and left.

If Alexander were awake, he wouldn't have made such a fuss over trivial matters...

"Do you enjoy acting?"

Sophia's voice snapped him out of his thoughts.

They'd reached a quiet corner.

Her expression was serious, gaze focused.

Adrian scowled. "None of your business."

Sophia frowned.

"If you love something, give it your all."

His lips twitched.

How did these two strangers share the same lecturing tone?

He rolled his eyes. "Who says I'm not serious?"

Sophia said nothing.

Memories of his cringe-worthy acting compilations flooded her mind.

As much as she wanted to defend him, Adrian's acting skills were... objectively terrible.

Sophia studied him closely.

Adrian bore sixty-percent resemblance to Alexander, both sharing those captivating peach-blossom eyes.

But Alexander's gaze carried authority that commanded respect.

Adrian's eyes shimmered with naive innocence—when he wasn't wearing that insufferable smirk.

With such features, he should've been beloved.

How had things gone so wrong?

His current attitude provided the answer.

This young master did as he pleased in the industry, with no management to rein him in.

"Which agency represents you?"

Adrian's arrogant expression froze.

"Why do you care?"

Sophia chuckled darkly.

"Adrian Valdemar, asking for punishment?"

She picked up a wooden stick from the flowerbed, testing its weight.

"Do you need a beating to cooperate?"

Adrian's eyes widened at the makeshift weapon.
###Chapter 229

Adrian Valdemar stumbled back two steps, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Do you have violent tendencies? Hitting people at the drop of a hat—what kind of lady behaves like that?"

Sophia Laurent's lips curved slightly. "Lady-like behavior?"

She weighed the wooden stick in her hand. "Ready to answer my questions properly now?"

Adrian rolled his eyes in defeat. "No agency."

Several entertainment companies had approached him, but their gazes made his skin crawl.

Those agents' greedy eyes when they stared at his face resembled starving wolves spotting fresh meat.

Though unafraid, he refused to work with such people.

Even with his current online backlash, offers still poured in.

"No team?" Sophia arched an eyebrow. "You book gigs yourself?"

No wonder his career was in shambles.

"Who handles your red carpet looks?"
"Who manages crisis PR?"
"Who buries negative热搜?"

Adrian looked genuinely perplexed. "Outfits? Isn't throwing on clothes enough?"

He stated matter-of-factly: "With this face, I'd look good in a potato sack."

Sophia: "..."

"Narcissism is a disease."

Adrian scoffed: "It's called self-awareness."

"For gigs, I just pick whatever script catches my eye."

Sophia massaged her temples: "..."

"Impressive."

This young master's showbiz approach was truly primitive.

"Ever bought internet trolls?"

Adrian sneered: "Why would I need that trash? I can roast ten haters single-handedly."

Sophia suppressed a laugh: "Proud of that?"

"Damn right."

Now she understood why even his god-tier looks couldn't gain fans.

With his venomous tongue,任性 attitude, and unfiltered persona, he was a walking entertainment industry disaster.

Sophia took a moment to process this information.

Young Master Valdemar's situation was worse than she'd imagined.

"What's the point of these pointless questions?" Adrian frowned impatiently.

"Will Valdemar Group really cover my breach fee for 'Fleeting Love'?"

That was his only concern now.

Sophia nodded. "My word is bond."

Valdemar's legal team would handle it personally.
###Chapter 230

Adrian Valdemar finally relaxed when Sophia Laurent gave in.

He snorted coldly. "At least you know your place."

If not for worrying about how to explain things to his elder brother when he woke up, he would have cut ties with this woman long ago.

Adrian turned to leave.

"Wait."

Sophia's voice made him pause.

He turned back warily. "Looking for another fight? I won't let you win this time."

The spacious corridor gave him confidence to escape if needed.

Sophia shook her head helplessly. "Am I really that violent in your eyes?"

"Obviously." Adrian didn't hesitate. "You're vicious, cruel, and downright poisonous—"

Sophia narrowed her eyes, tapping the rod against her palm.

"Care to repeat that?"

Adrian immediately shut up.

The welts from this morning's beating still ached faintly.

He forced a dry laugh. "J-just kidding..."

This woman was practically a violent maniac.

When they first met, he'd mistaken her for some delicate little flower.

Turned out she was a thorny, aggressive predator.

Adrian had never been hit in his life before.

Now just looking at Sophia made his whole body ache.

"Spit it out. I'm busy."

Sophia dropped the playful tone.

"I own an entertainment company. I want to sign you."

She said seriously, "I can guarantee—"

"No!" Adrian cut her off.

Sophia arched a brow.

She'd been about to promise him top-tier resources.

But this idiot wouldn't even let her finish.

"Suit yourself." Sophia changed tactics. "What are your plans then?"

Adrian lifted his chin arrogantly.

"I'll take a few acting roles."

Sophia burst out laughing.

"What decent scripts would come looking for you?" She didn't mince words. "Don't tell me it's another fourth male lead in some cheap web drama like 'Love You Forever'?"

Not that she looked down on Adrian.

With his controversial reputation and cringe-worthy acting skills, no serious production would cast him.

Those offering roles just wanted to cash in on his notoriety.
###Chapter 231

Adrian Valdemar's face darkened instantly after hearing Sophia Laurent's words.

He gritted his teeth. "Who made that rule? I can do more than just idol dramas. I can handle spy thrillers, fantasy epics—"

His voice trailed off.

In idol dramas, he played minor roles. In spy thrillers, he was cast as sleazy villains. In fantasy epics, he ended up as the comic relief.

Sophia didn't call him out on it.

Instead, she asked, "Have you heard of the drama Empress?"

Adrian froze, then nodded sullenly. "Yeah."

Empress and Imperial Feast were the two hottest productions right now.

He'd secretly asked his agent to reach out to the Empress team. They hadn't even granted him an audition.

Sophia smiled at his dejected expression. "How would you feel about playing the third male lead in Empress?"

Adrian's head snapped up. "What?"

His eyes widened in disbelief.

"The third male lead in Empress?"

He shook his head. "Are you daydreaming?"

Empress was a prestige production. The role of the Young Marquis was complex—a spoiled nobleman who indulged in hedonism until tragedy forced him to grow into a war hero.

The character's dramatic arc demanded serious acting chops.

More importantly, the script specified the actor had to be breathtakingly handsome.

Director Lucas Sheridan had auditioned countless actors without finding the right fit. Fans had even started online polls about it.

"I'm serious," Sophia said. "Your looks are perfect for this role."

Adrian's face was undeniably striking.

But he waved his hands dismissively. "Don't joke about this. I'm not cut out for serious dramas."

He knew his limitations.

Though he'd taken acting classes, he'd never quite grasped the craft.

Playing shallow roles in cheesy romances was one thing. A production like Empress? Unthinkable.
###Chapter 232

Sophia's eyebrows arched slightly at Adrian's evasiveness.

The young master actually had some self-awareness.

"Knowing your shortcomings means you should work to improve them, not run away." Her tone turned stern. "What future can you have by wasting your days like this?"

Adrian frowned.

She sounded just like his eldest brother.

"Forget about 'Empress.' I'm leaving."

The upcoming historical drama was already the hottest project in the industry before filming even began.

Every veteran actor and A-lister was fighting for a role.

What chance did a D-list celebrity like him—already hated online—have except to attract more criticism?

Besides...

"I don't need charity roles."

Sophia smirked.

"What if I insist?"

She'd seen his potential.

On set, his eyes had burned with genuine passion.

He just needed someone to push him.

Adrian scoffed.

"No one's ever forced me to do anything I didn't want to do."

"Is that so?" Sophia tapped the wooden cane against her palm.

Adrian flinched.

This woman hit too hard.

Was she even human?

Wait—she wasn't even his real sister-in-law!

"I'll call the police!" He retreated, blustering. "Domestic violence is illegal!"

Sophia smiled sweetly.

"As the elder sister-in-law, disciplining you is my duty."

"Who asked you to?!" His ears turned red. "I'm a grown man!"

He glared at her defiantly.

"Try me."

The cane whistled through the air.

"Ow! You crazy—!"

Adrian scrambled away as Sophia chased him.

"Did no one teach you to respect women?"

He froze mid-step.

Truth was... no one had.

The girls he'd known before would laugh at anything he said.

Had his jokes really been that cruel all along?
###Chapter 233

Adrian Valdemar's back stiffened.

Sophia Laurent couldn't stop the momentum of her wooden stick in time.

A sharp crack echoed through the air.

The stick landed squarely across Adrian's back.

"Damn—" He sucked in a sharp breath.

Whirling around, his eyes burned with fury. "Did you do that on purpose?"

Sophia sheepishly withdrew her hand. "I thought you'd dodge..."

Adrian gritted his teeth. "How could I?"

She blinked. "Should we... go to the infirmary?"

"No." His refusal was absolute.

"Why not?"

"Too embarrassing."

Sophia burst into laughter. "So, will you take the role of the Young Marquis in Empress?"

Adrian frowned. "Can I choose another character?"

He was afraid he'd ruin the production.

Sophia shook her head. "Not an option."

Adrian glared. "Then why even ask?"

She shrugged. "Just for formality's sake."

He scoffed. "Should I thank you?"

"You're welcome."

Adrian was too furious to speak.

"Sophia!"

A booming voice interrupted them.

Director Lucas Sheridan strode over, squinting at the pair. "What are you two doing out here in this heat?"

His gaze shifted to Adrian. "And you are...?"

Sophia arched a brow. "Seriously don't recognize him?"

Lucas studied Adrian again before shaking his head.

Adrian instinctively straightened his posture—then winced in pain.

Sophia suppressed a smirk. "This is Adrian Valdemar."

"Adrian?" Lucas smacked his forehead. "Now I remember!"

"A couple years back during that variety show, the producer mentioned wanting you!"

"Too bad my show was a flop..."

Adrian's ears turned pink. "Nice to meet you, Director Sheridan."

Lucas shook his hand enthusiastically. "The pleasure's mine!"

Adrian was visibly flustered by the warm reception.
###Chapter 234

Adrian Valdemar had lived in shadows for as long as he could remember.

In the Valdemar household, only his eldest brother Alexander ever acknowledged him.

His father despised him. His mother loathed him, often resorting to physical abuse.

One memory stood out vividly—his mother gripping his throat during an episode, screaming hysterically, "Why don't you just die?"

Even in lucid moments, she avoided him like the plague.

His grandfather was preoccupied with business. Alexander was buried in studies.

Gradually, Adrian grew accustomed to solitude.

Then Julian arrived—a boy even more unfortunate than himself. Finally, he had company.

As an adult, people either treated him with cold indifference or groveled for favors.

This was the first time anyone had offered him genuine kindness.

Adrian froze, fingertips trembling imperceptibly.

He clenched his jaw, forcing his expression into practiced indifference.

Sophia Laurent gave him no time to recover. Turning to Lucas Sheridan, she declared, "He's perfect for the Young Marquis role."

Lucas raised an eyebrow, reassessing Adrian.

The young man's striking features—chiseled jawline, arresting eyes—lived up to the script's description of "peerless beauty."

More remarkably, his looks were completely natural.

Lucas's eyes lit up. "Sophia, another Lowell Entertainment discovery? How has someone this striking stayed under the radar?"

"Not ours." Sophia cleared her throat. "Just tell me if he'll work."

"Physically? Flawless." Lucas nodded. "Shall we screen test now?"

Adrian's breath hitched.

"Not today." Sophia waved a hand. "I'll bring him back in a week. Can you wait?"

"Absolutely!" Lucas agreed readily. "We've searched three months for this role. A few more days won't matter."

Adrian remained rigid throughout, his mind reeling even as he followed Sophia out.

A screen test?

What if he embarrassed himself?

What if he humiliated Sophia?

Regret flooded him. He should have refused outright.

"Earth to Adrian!" Sophia's voice carried across the distance. "Stop daydreaming! Come here!"

He bristled instantly. "Who are you calling—"

"Whoever responds." Her smirk held feline mischief.

Scowling, Adrian stalked after her—though the tips of his ears burned betrayingly red.
###Chapter 235

Lucas Sheridan's lips curved into a smile as his gaze flickered between the two. "Sophia, who's this?"

Sophia Laurent reached out to ruffle Adrian Valdemar's hair. "My kid."

Lucas's pupils contracted slightly.

Sophia wasn't just the long-lost heiress of the Laurent family. She was also the wife of Alexander Valdemar, the head of Valdemar Holdings.

And this handsome young man shared the same surname...

Could he really be from that Valdemar family?

Adrian slapped Sophia's hand away. "Who's your kid?"

He snorted. "Don't get ahead of yourself."

This woman wouldn't fool his brother.

Pretty face, poisonous heart.

Sophia narrowed her eyes. "Say that again?"

Adrian's Adam's apple bobbed as he wisely shut his mouth.

Her hits hurt like hell.

Sophia nodded in satisfaction before withdrawing her gaze.

Brat needed discipline.

Lucas observed their interaction, amusement deepening in his eyes.

The trio arrived at the "Empress" filming set.

The assistant director was shooting a scene where the female lead governed flood control after ascending the throne.

On screen, Scarlett Winslow wore masculine attire with striking elegance.

Her delicate features and straight posture exuded imperial majesty with every movement.

The assistant director nodded repeatedly.

The entire crew became immersed, as if transported to that ancient dynasty.

Despite Scarlett's superb acting, several takes required reshoots.

The assistant director patiently pointed out the emotional nuances needing adjustment.

Adrian watched, transfixed.

He'd never seen such a professional set before.

No yelling. No belittling. Just focused, dedicated work.

A sudden longing stirred within him.

Maybe... he could really try out for the young marquis role?

But soon, Adrian lowered his lashes.

The gap between him and Scarlett was insurmountable.

Even an award-winning actress needed retakes. How could he possibly pass the audition?

Adrian studied the actors' expressions intently, absorbing their techniques.

Sophia noted his concentrated gaze, her lips curving upward.
###Chapter 236

Sophia Laurent had assumed Adrian Valdemar was just another spoiled playboy, as arrogant and entitled as Christopher Lowell, using his family name to bully others.

Had it been Christopher being publicly humiliated on set, he would have flipped tables and stormed off long ago.

Yet Adrian surprised her by enduring it silently.

She didn't know how long he'd been subjected to the verbal abuse when she arrived.

He looked almost pitiful.

The usual cockiness was gone from his face, replaced only by focus and curiosity.

Sophia rested her chin thoughtfully on her palm.

Apparently this young master genuinely loved acting.

He'd just lacked proper career guidance and professional training until now.

After observing for a while, Sophia quietly withdrew.

Her doctor had advised against overexertion during this delicate period.

She headed to the resting lounge Lucas Sheridan had prepared during lunch break.

Before leaving, she instructed the driver to keep an eye on Adrian.

The lounge contained a recliner and soft blankets.

Sophia fell asleep the moment she lay down.

When she awoke, the sunset painted the sky outside.

Glancing at her watch, she was startled to see it was already 6 p.m.

She'd slept over three hours straight.

After smoothing her clothes, she walked leisurely back to set.

Adrian was still there, perched on a small folding stool.

He cradled his chin in one hand while watching the filming, a script open on his lap.

"Been here all afternoon?" Sophia asked softly.

Adrian blinked, only now noticing the late hour.

This was the first time he'd been so engrossed in observing a shoot that he lost track of time.

"Why are you still here?" He frowned at her.

Sophia smiled faintly. "Same reason as you."

"Where were you earlier?"

"Sleeping," she answered matter-of-factly.

Adrian was momentarily speechless.

"Word is you invested heavily in this," he finally said. "Yet you nap instead of supervising?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "My prerogative. Got a problem?"

Amused by his flustered expression, she explained, "Director Sheridan handles production. My job is writing checks."
###Chapter 237

Adrian Valdemar leaned against the railing on the film set, his gaze sweeping over the veteran actors performing.

"These thespians don't perform like this for just anyone," he remarked with hidden meaning.

Sophia Laurent tilted her head slightly. Sunlight cast shadows through her lashes.

"Quite rare indeed."

She paused, a faint smile curling her lips. "Though acting doesn't interest me."

Adrian's brows furrowed. Surprise flickered in his eyes.

"No interest?"

His scrutinizing gaze traveled over Sophia, assessing her sincerity.

"With all the online buzz, I assumed you were entering the entertainment industry."

Sophia's recent public clashes with the Lowell family and her revelation as the genius composer T had amassed her a massive following.

At her current popularity, debut would guarantee instant stardom.

Having just returned from abroad, Adrian remained unaware Sophia had already disclosed her identities as Pearl Group's founder and Mrs. Valdemar.

Sophia chuckled, twirling her phone between her fingers.

"My schedule's packed. No plans for that now."

Adrian's expression darkened abruptly.

"Too busy seizing power at Valdemar Holdings, then?"

He couldn't fathom why the Patriarch would allow this woman to meddle in company affairs.

Sophia ignored his barbed tone, her smile only brightening.

"The Valdemar CEO position is highly coveted. Naturally, I'll treasure it."

A vein pulsed at Adrian's temple.

"Scheming woman! I'll make Grandfather see your true colors!"

Sophia checked the time calmly.

"Visiting the sanatorium now? Perfect timing—I was heading there too."

Adrian's face soured further.

He typically avoided the Patriarch—their meetings always ended badly.

But this time, he had no choice.

"Fine! Let's go!"

He couldn't comprehend Sophia's composure. Wasn't she afraid of being exposed?

After bidding the crew farewell, the three entered the car.

Silence filled the vehicle.

Sophia scrolled through news updates. Lowell Entertainment's stocks had hit rock bottom.

Derek Langley's scandal kept escalating, with partners terminating contracts and demanding compensation.

Online vitriol toward William Lowell flooded social media. Lowell Entertainment existed in name only.
###Chapter 238

The escort scandal at Lowell Entertainment continued to escalate, leaving nearly all its high-profile celebrities in ruins.

Those who maintained their integrity, like Scarlett Ashcroft once did, remained obscure in the industry.

"River Banquet" became the last lifeline for Lowell Entertainment.

Director Richard Lowell had no time to spare for Sophia Laurent, fully immersed in filming.

After two lead actor replacements, the film's popularity noticeably declined.

Fortunately, Emily Lowell kept the buzz alive.

Though she had no notable works, her social media presence was staggering.

Richard managed to temporarily suppress the Derek Langley incident.

The fate of "River Banquet" would determine the survival of Lowell Entertainment.

Online whitewashing attempts surged.

"Director Lowell is devoted to art. How could he know about the filth within his company?"

"The Lowells are truly cursed to have someone like Derek Langley in their midst."

"Shouldn't Sophia Laurent take responsibility? After all, he's her adoptive mother's brother."

"Poor Emily, being targeted by her own sister like this..."

Emily's socialite persona attracted countless fans.

Luxury cars, mansions, and jewelry painted an enviable lifestyle.

Her image of innocence and kindness was deeply ingrained.

Many fans migrated from the Lowell brothers' fanbases.

Even after Christopher and Nathan Lowell's downfalls, Emily remained unshaken.

Fans saw her as their final solace.

She embodied purity and nobility.

A cold smile curled Sophia's lips as she read these comments.

She logged into her social media account and dropped a bombshell.

"Derek Langley was indeed recommended by Emily Lowell. I happen to know the reason."

After yesterday's Valdemar Group press conference, the entire internet knew Sophia's identity.

The title of Valdemar Group's chairwoman stunned the public.

Her status as Pearl Group's founder was overshadowed.

Online discussions intensified.

The post immediately caused an uproar.

"Sophia's dropping hints!"

"Major tea alert! Gather round!"

"Emily actually knew Derek Langley?"

"Could there be something shady between them?"

Emily's fans rushed to control the narrative.

"Just say it outright, Sophia. Stop being passive-aggressive!"
###Chapter 239

Sophia Laurent's slender fingers glided across her phone screen.

The comments defending Emily Lowell made her lips curve slightly.

"Our Emily is pure and kind-hearted. Unlike you with your scheming mind."

"Growing up in that environment explains your dark personality."

"Stop mentioning Emily. You're only embarrassing yourself."

Adrian Valdemar observed the girl in the backseat through the rearview mirror.

His gaze had lingered on her since she entered the car.

Sophia wore a black turtleneck that accentuated her snow-white skin.

Her thick lashes cast shadows under her eyes.

Her red lips curled in a faint smile.

Even after encountering countless beauties, Adrian had to admit Sophia possessed lethal allure.

This only heightened his wariness.

A woman who suddenly married into wealth always had ulterior motives.

Even if she helped him today, his guard wouldn't lower easily.

Sophia remained oblivious to Adrian's scrutiny.

Her delicate fingers tapped the screen as she posted another update:

"Twenty-three years ago, Emily Lowell and I were born in the same hospital and accidentally switched."

"Her adoptive parents are my biological ones."

"Derek Langley is her maternal uncle."

Those few sentences ignited the internet.

The comment section exploded.

"Switched at birth? Isn't this a novel plot?"

"So Sophia is the real Lowell heiress?"

"Everything Emily has now rightfully belongs to Sophia?"

Emily's fans fell silent.

Their proud "Lowell heiress" title—

The luxurious jewelry, mansions, sports cars—

All should have been Sophia's.

Even those doting older brothers belonged to Sophia by blood.

After a long pause, a fan weakly defended:

"Even if identities got mixed up, the Lowells prefer Emily because she's more outstanding..."

Sophia's eyes flashed with irony at the comment.

Adrian noticed her expression change.

His grip on the steering wheel tightened.

What scheme was this woman plotting now?
###Chapter 240

The internet exploded.

Emily Lowell's true origins were exposed. The news that she wasn't biologically related to the Lowells spread like wildfire.

Fan groups erupted in chaos.

"How could this be? I always thought she was a real heiress..."

"Those limited-edition bags and custom gowns actually belonged to Sophia Laurent?"

Many fans began wavering.

Die-hard supporters immediately jumped to her defense.

"It's not Emily's fault she was switched at birth!"

"If the Lowells dislike Sophia, doesn't that mean she's the problem?"

"Exactly! One person hating her could be prejudice, but the whole family? She must be seriously messed up!"

Sophia's fans couldn't stay silent.

"Bullshit!"

"Enduring abuse yet remaining kind - that's a real queen!"

"The Lowells are blind and heartless. How dare they call others twisted?"

The comment section became a battlefield.

Someone dug up old grievances.

"Remember when Director Lowell publicly bashed his own daughter?"

"Said he failed to raise Sophia properly? Hilarious! He never even tried!"

More skeletons tumbled out.

"Nathan Lowell's music was all Sophia's work behind the scenes."

"And that ingrate turned around and insulted her?"

"Lone Mountain only succeeded because of Gavin Croix - Sophia's friend."

Netizens grew increasingly shocked.

"The Lowells' success came from Sophia's silent support."

"Yet they treated their own flesh and blood like an enemy?"

"Cutting ties was the smartest move."

Public opinion completely reversed.

"Throwing away a pearl for fish eyes? The Lowells must be blind!"

Two factions waged heated debates.

One side insisted Emily was innocent.

"Kindness has nothing to do with bloodline!"

"If Sophia was so great, why couldn't she earn her family's love? She must be flawed!"

The other side scoffed.

"Biological daughter abused while adopted child lived in luxury."

"This isn't favoritism - it's insanity!"

The war spread from social media to forums.

Six related topics dominated the top ten trends.

#EmilyLowellFakeHeiress

#SophiaLaurentRealPearl

#LowellsBlindnessConfirmed

Netizens picked sides.

"Team Sophia all the way!"

"Who needs toxic family like that?"

The scandal kept growing.

Emily's endorsement deals began dissolving.

Lowell Entertainment's stocks plummeted.

This switched-at-birth storm was just beginning.
###Chapter 241

The media storm swept across the internet like a hurricane. Richard Lowell nearly collapsed in his office when he saw the news.

Lowell Entertainment had become an empty shell. Its stock price plummeted, leaving the entire company in panic.

"River Banquet" was his last lifeline. This big-budget production not only hired an elite writing team but also invested heavily, nearly exhausting Lowell Entertainment's remaining resources.

Even after Emily's massive blunder, he suppressed his anger.

But misfortunes never come singly.

Within days, Richard's wrinkles deepened, and stark white strands appeared at his temples. The once-ambitious tycoon now carried only bitterness in his eyes.

He loathed Sophia Laurent.

A real daughter would have handed over the Valdemar resources without hesitation. Once the Lowells rose to the elite, she would have benefited too.

But this selfish girl lacked any sense of the bigger picture.

Yet he couldn't bring himself to reprimand his beloved Emily.

Dinner at the Lowell residence was shrouded in eerie silence.

"Emily." Richard suddenly set down his chopsticks. "Did you arrange for Derek Langley to join the company?"

He usually focused solely on creative work, never meddling in such trivial matters.

William stiffened at the question.

Lately, he'd been drowning in stress. Public humiliation from Sophia, coupled with single-handedly propping up the crumbling Lowell empire, had pushed him to the brink.

Emily's spoon clattered into her bowl.

Tears welled in her eyes as she trembled. "Dad, I swear I didn't know what kind of man he was..."

"My adoptive parents forced me to arrange it... I barely knew Derek..."

"Adoptive parents?" Richard frowned.

Emily clenched her napkin, lips pale from biting. "The... the Butcher family..."

The dining room plunged into silence.

Everyone remembered the absurd baby-switching scandal. Sophia was the victim, but hadn't Emily suffered too?

How could anyone understand the pain of discovering the family who raised you were strangers?
###Chapter 242

William Lowell was the first to lose his composure. He slammed his chopsticks onto the bowl with a loud clatter.

"Dad, stop asking." His brows furrowed deeply. "Those adoptive parents were vicious. They must have threatened Emily."

Victoria Lowell had just repaid Sophia Laurent's nine million, finally feeling some relief.

She quickly chimed in. "Those people were monsters. How can you blame Emily?"

Yet thinking of Sophia's childhood suffering still pained her heart.

Both were her daughters. She genuinely wanted to make amends with Sophia, but the girl wanted nothing to do with her.

Christopher Lowell remained in detention.

Daniel Lowell was preoccupied with Versini Couture's haute couture design competition, staying at his apartment near the company.

As a premier couture brand, Versini's internal selection process was exceptionally rigorous.

Every designer, regardless of seniority, had to submit original creations.

The chief designer would personally evaluate each piece, deciding who stayed or left.

Fashion was a brutal industry where trends changed overnight.

Many designers who failed to keep up vanished without a trace.

Adding to the pressure, Versini's elusive founder would attend the competition in person.

Gaining that person's favor could launch a designer's career.

At the Lowell dinner table sat only Richard Lowell, Victoria, William, Emily, and Nathan.

Since his music career scandal, Nathan had grown quiet.

Hearing his mother and brother defend Emily, he slowly lifted his gaze.

The girl still wore that innocent expression, her eyes glistening like a startled fawn.

But Nathan's eyes darkened.

What he'd uncovered didn't match this picture of purity.

Who would guess this seemingly guileless girl had participated in bullying Sophia?

Though she hadn't done the deeds herself, the ringleader had been Emily's best friend.

That girl had torn Sophia's textbooks, locked her in storage rooms until midnight.

They'd believed Emily's claims that Sophia was out partying.

The bully spread rumors of Sophia stealing, turning the whole school against her.

Sometimes they'd gotten physical, though Sophia apparently held her own.

Each time Sophia returned home disheveled, they'd scolded her for not being as well-behaved as Emily.

And Emily? Always pristine, standing aside like an innocent bystander.

Nathan mechanically stirred his soup.

They'd thought they knew this sister.

Now he understood she was far more complex than she appeared.

She'd just mastered the art of deception too well.

"Fourth brother..." Emily suddenly called to him in that timid voice.

Her eyes reddened like a frightened rabbit.
###Chapter 243

The Nathan of old would have immediately embraced his sister to comfort her.

But now, he only felt a chilling cold seep through his bones.

How terrifying must a girl be if she could orchestrate a kidnapping at fourteen?

The most agonizing thought was how to explain this to Sophia.

Emily's lashes fluttered as she lowered her gaze, her delicate appearance enough to soften anyone's heart.

"Nathan!" William slammed his chopsticks down. "Emily's speaking to you. Are you deaf?"

Nathan's eyes swept across the table before he rose slowly.

"I'm done eating."

He walked upstairs without a backward glance.

Richard frowned. "What's gotten into him?"

"Leave him be," Victoria sighed. "He's been like this since the incident."

She turned to Emily with a gentle smile. "Your brother's in a mood. Don't take it personally."

"I understand." Emily nodded obediently.

No one saw the ruthless glint in her eyes when she lowered her head.

Nathan had been acting strangely lately.

In the past, the slightest show of vulnerability would make him yield unconditionally.

Now, he wouldn't even let her near.

This wasn't right.

She needed to accelerate her plans and seize control of the Lowell family sooner.

"It's just a singing career," William scoffed. "Who's he trying to impress with that attitude?"

His tone softened instantly as he served Emily more food. "Eat up. You've lost weight."

"Thank you, William." Emily beamed sweetly.

Victoria watched them share utensils, an uneasy feeling flickering through her.

Even close siblings should maintain boundaries.

Oblivious, Richard said sternly, "Next time someone threatens you, come straight to me."

Emily flashed a grateful smile. "You're the best, Dad."

She nibbled on a rib, her gaze drifting toward the second floor.

Where the obstacle she needed to eliminate resided.
###Chapter 244

Emily Lowell's doe-like eyes blinked rapidly, giving her the vulnerable appearance of a startled fawn.

Victoria Lowell's heart melted at the sight. "Silly child, there's no need for formalities with your parents."

She sighed inwardly. It was all those wretched adoptive parents' fault for raising such a well-mannered child with such warped sensibilities.

"Mmm." Emily nodded obediently. "Don't worry, Mother. I can handle it."

A shadow flickered in her eyes.

Those lowlifes were like leeches that refused to let go. She'd deal with them eventually.

But Richard Lowell must never suspect a thing.

As long as that secret remained buried, Sophia could never touch her no matter how much she thrashed about.

Victoria patted her hand approvingly. "If only Sophia were half as sensible as you."

Her gaze lingered on her docile daughter with deep satisfaction.

Meanwhile, Sophia Laurent lounged in the backseat of a car scrolling through her phone.

The whitewashing comments from Emily's fans drew a cold chuckle from her.

Kind? Virtuous?

Adrian Valdemar stole a glance through the rearview mirror and felt an involuntary shiver.

That particular laugh never preceded anything good.

He hunched his shoulders, making himself as inconspicuous as possible.

The internet suddenly exploded.

#SHOCKING! Rising star's intimate photos with multiple men surface#
#The dark truth behind entertainment industry's fake heiress#
#Twisted sibling relationships in wealthy family exposed#

Netizens initially dismissed it as fake news.

Then they opened the posts and collectively gasped.

The woman in the photos was unmistakably Emily Lowell.

Her male companions? The Lowell brothers themselves.

The first photo showed Emily pressed flush against Christopher Lowell, her arms wrapped tightly around his waist.

In the second, she perched on Nathan Lowell's lap feeding him fruit while they exchanged intimate smiles.

The third was even more scandalous—Emily sharing a bed with Daniel Lowell.

The final image depicted William Lowell cradling her in his arms, his gaze dripping with tenderness.

The internet went nuclear.

"Holy shit! Is this really free content?"
"Rich people are disgusting!"
"Are we sure these are siblings?"
"My moral compass just shattered!"
###Chapter 245

The professional authentication results were in.
The photos showed no signs of digital manipulation.

The back garden of The Chateau Versailles.
The set of Elle Magazine's photoshoot.
The bedroom of the Lowell family villa.
Every location had been thoroughly exposed by netizens.

"This can't be real!"
Emily Lowell's fan group erupted in chaos.

"Look how intimate Moonlight is with her brothers!"
"If my own brother acted like that, I'd have called the police ages ago!"

Old clips from live streams resurfaced.
"Remember when people said their behavior crossed the line? Her fans attacked anyone who pointed it out!"
"And now? Pathetic..."

In the Lowell family dining room.
Emily's phone vibrated incessantly.

Richard Lowell frowned. "Who's messaging you?"
Emily opened the notifications—her face drained of color.

There it was.
Her body pressed against William Lowell's chest.
Her fingers trembled violently.

William noticed her distress.
His gaze dropped to the screen.

"What's going on?"
His voice turned icy.

Emily shook her head frantically.
"I don't know..."

She clutched his wrist.
Her fingertips were freezing.

"William..."
Her voice cracked with tears.

William's expression softened.
"Don't be afraid."
He wrapped his hand around her shaking one.
###Chapter 246

The air in the dining room turned icy.

Richard Lowell set down his chopsticks, his sharp gaze sweeping over his son and daughter.

"What are you doing?"

Victoria Lowell noticed their intertwined hands, her brows knitting together involuntarily.

"William, let go of Emily first."

William Lowell snapped out of his daze and quickly released Emily's hand.

He composed himself, his tone calm. "Someone is spreading rumors about Emily online. I've sent people to handle it."

Richard scoffed. He didn’t need to guess who was behind it.

"Go ahead."

William grabbed his phone and hurried upstairs, his retreating figure betraying a hint of haste.

Emily immediately put down her bowl and chopsticks.

"Mom, Dad, I’ll go check on the situation."

With her father’s silent approval, she practically fled the room.

Victoria stared at the staircase, hesitating.

"Richard, don’t you think—"

"Think what?" Richard cut her off impatiently.

"Their relationship... isn’t it too intimate?"

Richard slammed his teacdown.

"Is it wrong for siblings to be close? Should they be at each other’s throats like Sophia to be considered normal?"

Victoria fell silent but filed the thought away.

Under the pretense of clearing the table, she quietly followed them upstairs.

Emily pushed open William’s door without knocking.

"Big brother..."

Her voice carried its usual fragility.

William stared at his computer screen, his expression dark.

Only when she entered did his features soften slightly.

"Why did you come up?"

"Those photos..." Emily's eyes welled with tears.

"I’ve already taken care of it." William rubbed his temples.

Seeing his sister’s distress, he instinctively opened his arms.

Emily threw herself into his embrace.

"Don’t be afraid. We’ve done nothing wrong."

Though the intimate moments captured between Emily and their brothers had surprised him, he quickly rationalized it.

Siblings raised together since childhood were bound to be close.

Emily relaxed into the familiar warmth of his arms, exhaling quietly in relief.

She had always been careful, reserving such closeness for private moments.

She never expected to be caught on camera.

Sophia!

Her teeth clenched, venom flashing in her eyes.

It didn’t matter.

She still held the trump card.

That video of Sophia fooling around with gangsters at the hotel would ruin her completely.

When the time came, everyone would see Sophia for what she truly was.

Then, let’s see how the Valdemars would still accept that bitch.

She had deliberately kept this video when destroying evidence.

Now, it would become her deadliest weapon.
###Chapter 247

Sophia Laurent had just taken the position of CEO at Valdemar Holdings, but her footing wasn't secure yet.

The video in her possession was her trump card. Now wasn't the right time to reveal it.

Once she solidified her position at Valdemar, she would use this video to extract maximum benefits.

After securing the money, she would release the footage, ensuring Sophia lost the Valdemar family's backing completely.

Meanwhile, Victoria Lowell set down her chopsticks and quietly retreated to her bedroom.

She opened her phone. The top trending hashtag displayed intimate photos of Emily Lowell with the four Lowell brothers.

Her fingers trembled slightly.

In the pictures, Emily was either nestled in her brothers' arms or resting her head on their laps, her expression coy.

Victoria's heart clenched.

This couldn't be real.

Emily had always been the epitome of grace and propriety. How could she do something like this?

And with all four brothers!

Suddenly, Emily's earlier panic made sense.

Victoria paced the room anxiously before deciding to confront them.

She marched straight to William Lowell's bedroom.

She raised her hand to knock but changed her mind and pushed the door open instead.

It wasn't locked.

The sight that greeted her was William embracing Emily.

"What are you doing?" Victoria's voice was icy.

They sprang apart.

"Mom, why didn't you knock?" William frowned.

Emily kept her head down and murmured, "Mom."

Victoria scoffed. "Since when do I need permission to enter my own son's room?"

Her gaze flickered between them.

"Unless there's something you're hiding?"

William forced a smile. "Mom, don't believe those online rumors."

Victoria studied his face in silence.

"Emily, go to your room," she commanded. "I need to speak with your brother alone."

Emily hurried out, her steps unsteady.

Once the door closed, Victoria locked eyes with William.

"William, tell me the truth. Are you in love with Emily?"
###Chapter 248

William Lowell met Victoria Lowell's piercing gaze, his heart sinking like a stone.

He forced a smile. "Who in this family doesn't adore Emily?"

Victoria studied his feigned nonchalance. "I'm not talking about sibling affection."

She cut straight to the chase. "Do you want to marry Emily Lowell?"

The question struck like lightning.

William's pupils constricted. His entire body froze.

It took him several seconds to find his voice. "Mother! What kind of joke is this?"

His tone trembled. "We're siblings!"

Victoria observed his shocked expression, her brow furrowing slightly.

"Is that truly how you feel?"

She'd always suspected her son looked at Emily differently.

But apparently, he remained oblivious to those feelings.

William answered without hesitation. "Why would I lie about something like this?"

Victoria held his gaze for a long moment before finally relenting. "Good."

Her tone shifted. "But you must maintain proper boundaries. Without blood relation, excessive closeness invites gossip."

The memory of her sons competing to embrace Emily made her chest tighten.

No wonder they doted on Emily so excessively.

This was how they behaved in private.

Utterly inappropriate.

William instinctively protested. "Mother, you're overreacting! What's wrong with siblings being close? Those internet trolls—"

"William." Victoria cut him off. "She's not your biological sister."

The words doused him like ice water.

William's expression hardened.

After a prolonged silence, he spoke hoarsely. "...I understand."

This thought had never occurred to him.

Only now did he realize Emily shared no blood relation with him.

An image of Sophia Laurent flashed through his mind.

His eyes darkened with complex emotions.

Victoria sighed and left.

Once alone, William immediately ordered his team to control the online narrative.

Soon, negative posts about Emily were mass-deleted.

Anyone could tell money had silenced the critics.

But the heavy-handed approach only bred greater resentment.

"The Lowells flexing their power again! Money talks, huh?"

"Showering their adopted daughter with love while freezing out their real daughter. How ironic!"

"Stop mentioning Sophia. She's moved on from them!"

"Is Lowell Entertainment finished after this scandal?"
###Chapter 249

The Lowell Group had suffered consecutive defeats in the business world, incurring heavy losses.

Sophia Laurent's decision to sever ties with them was wise. Such a family, biased toward their adopted daughter, wasn't worth clinging to.

Though William Lowell hastily deleted the intimate sibling photos, netizens had already saved them.

The news that Emily Lowell was adopted had spread like wildfire.

While the internet mocked the Lowells and Emily, they also voiced outrage on Sophia's behalf. This became the hottest topic both inside and outside their social circles.

Victoria Lowell had just stepped out of William's room when her phone began ringing incessantly.

"Mrs. Lowell, is it true Emily isn't your biological daughter?"

"Have you seen the news? Sophia is now acting CEO of Valdemar Holdings!"

"When did Sophia get married? Why weren't we informed of such joyous news?"

"That's the Valdemar family! Even a fraction of their resources could sustain an ordinary person for life. Your family must be thriving now..."

"Emily seemed so well-behaved before, but Sophia is the true success—beautiful and favored by Patriarch Valdemar. How enviable..."

Victoria's expression darkened with each call.

She couldn't tell if these socialites were genuinely congratulating her or subtly mocking her.

Every word felt like a knife to her heart.

Had Sophia remained obedient as before, she would've been overjoyed.

But now, Sophia avoided them at all costs.

Despite being bound by blood, they'd become more distant than strangers.

The thought made Victoria's chest tighten.

She paused absently outside Emily's door.

If the hospital hadn't mixed up the babies all those years ago, would things have turned out differently?

Back then, the hospital had been overcrowded, beds scarce.

The Lowell family was already declining, and Victoria hadn't wanted to deliver alongside those elite socialites.

Their glamorous entourages and lavish displays had left her bitter.

Those women had looked down on her fading family.

So she'd chosen a VIP maternity suite in a standard hospital.

There, she'd basked in the admiration of ordinary mothers, her vanity thoroughly satisfied.

But she never imagined the nurses would switch the babies.

That mistake had lasted fourteen years.

Victoria fell silent, lost in memories.

Richard Lowell also received numerous calls.

The thinly veiled mockery beneath the congratulatory tones enraged him so much he overturned the dining table.

His original plan had been perfect—announce Sophia's marriage to the Valdemars at the right moment, making everyone envy him.

But Sophia refused to follow his script.

Instead of benefiting the Lowells, she opposed them at every turn, becoming his greatest regret.

Even now, he dared not publicly acknowledge the marital alliance between their families.

Who could've predicted Sophia would rise so high in the Valdemar household?

If only he'd sent Emily to marry into that family instead.

With Emily as a Valdemar, he'd be the envy of all.

The thought filled him with unbearable regret.
###Chapter 250

The medical robotics project was Lowell Group's last lifeline.

Sophia Laurent had poured her heart into this venture during her tenure.

The massive initial investments were now yielding groundbreaking results.

Its official launch had drawn attention from investors and medical institutions alike.

Success would resurrect the sinking Lowell Group from oblivion.

Richard Lowell sat in his office, emotions churning.

He couldn't deny Sophia's business acumen.

Yet the memory of her ruthless departure made his chest constrict.

Had she remained loyal, the Lowell name wouldn't be drowning in disgrace.

Stock prices plummeted. Nathan and Christopher's careers imploded.

The once-proud Lowell family had become the industry's laughingstock.

The bitterest irony? He'd orchestrated their downfall himself.

Richard clutched his chest, the metallic tang of blood flooding his throat.

Meanwhile, Sophia observed the shifting tides of public opinion on her phone.

A cold smile curved her lips as she set the device aside.

Emily Lowell's reckoning had only just begun.

"Plotting someone's demise?"

Adrian Valdemar caught her dangerous expression in the rearview mirror.

"None of your concern."

Sophia reclined lazily against the seat. "Focus on the Young Marquis role in 'Empress' instead."

Adrian's eyes lit up before he turned away with affected indifference.

"If you're so determined to see me—"

"I said no such thing."

Her airy interruption made his head snap back.

"You arranged my audition!"

"Hmm." Sophia toyed with her phone. "Just like how I suggested you sign with Pearl Entertainment."

Adrian's protest died in his throat.

"Resources prioritize signed talent."

Her casual tone underscored their transactional relationship.

Sophia wouldn't lift a finger for Adrian—were it not for avoiding Valdemar family complications.

Even the违约金 hardly concerned her.

But acquiring Adrian...

Her assessing gaze traced his sculpted features.

With his assets, stardom was inevitable.

The realization struck Adrian belatedly.

'Empress' had been bait all along.

Yet he'd willingly taken the hook.

That set's rare atmosphere—professional director, harmonious cast—was worth swallowing his pride for.
###Chapter 251

The performances of the veteran actors on set left Adrian Valdemar in awe.

Just a few hours of observation had enriched him immensely.

Sophia Laurent recognized this potential. She renewed her offer to sign him with Pearl Entertainment.

Adrian caught her smiling eyes in the rearview mirror. He gritted his teeth. "Fine, I'll sign."

If Sophia could provide such resources, why refuse?

After all, this woman had ulterior motives for marrying his brother. Until she achieved them, she wouldn't harm him.

"But on one condition—my agent and lawyer must be present during signing."

He wouldn't sign any binding contract that trapped him permanently.

"No problem," Sophia agreed readily.

Such a minor request was easily accommodated.

Adrian exhaled, then silently cursed his own weakness.

As the car entered Valdemar Sanatorium, his thoughts remained tangled.

Patriarch Valdemar sat propped against the headboard, flipping through a magazine.

Hearing the knock, he looked up. His stern expression softened instantly at the sight of Sophia.

"Sophia, you're here?"

"Me too," Adrian peeked out from behind her. "Old man, I'm back."

The patriarch's face darkened. He hurled a pillow. "You dare show your face?"

Adrian caught it midair. "Why shouldn't I come back?"

"Wasting your life in idleness! How did our family produce such a disappointment?"

Not to mention the scandal of harassing his sister-in-law upon returning.

Adrian's smile vanished.

"Heh!" He sneered. "Blame the bad genes. I inherited them."

"You insolent—!" The patriarch's breathing turned ragged.

Among the younger Valdemars, Adrian alone showed no fear, always provoking his rage.

Adrian remained stiff-faced. "This is how I talk. Since when do you care?"

The patriarch's furious glare sent chills down Adrian's spine.

Though inwardly nervous, Adrian maintained his defiant front.

"If I didn't worry you'd hand our legacy to outsiders, I wouldn't bother enduring this..."

Another pillow came flying.

"Get out!"

As tensions escalated between grandfather and grandson, Sophia intervened. "Grandfather, don't be angry. Adrian actually missed you."

Adrian rolled his eyes.

Miss this hot-tempered old man?

What a joke!

Sophia turned her smiling gaze on him. "Adrian, isn't that right?"

Adrian: "??"

He suddenly recalled that morning's beating.

His body seemed to ache anew.

His lips twitched. Reluctantly, he nodded. "Right... old man, I missed you..."
###Chapter 252

Mu Li lifted her gaze, the corners of her eyes slightly upturned.

"Got it."

Zhou Lulu froze for two seconds before bursting into laughter.

"Your reaction time is painfully slow."

Mu Li didn't respond, only giving her a cool glance.

They parted ways at the school gate. Zhou Lulu headed back to the dorm while Mu Li turned toward the café.

She had arranged to meet Dong Cheng for tutoring today.

Standing in front of the café, Mu Li hesitated—an unfamiliar emotion that made her frown.

Zou Ming spotted her through the glass door and was about to greet her when he noticed her standing there, lost in thought.

Interesting.

He stroked his chin and pulled out his phone, dialing Han Lichen's number. "Boss, Miss Mu is here, but she's just standing outside."

Han Lichen stood by the second-floor window, his gaze fixed on the slender figure. He hadn't looked away since she appeared.

Leng Yue stood beside him, confused.

After the call ended, Mu Li still hadn't moved. Han Lichen's eyes darkened as he strode downstairs.

He was afraid she might actually turn and leave.

Han Lichen paused at the staircase landing, his black shirt accentuating his pale complexion. Leaning casually against the railing, he exuded an air of aloof elegance.

Mu Li looked up, their eyes meeting.

Now she understood why so many people were drawn to him.

Pushing the door open, Mu Li walked straight to Zou Ming. "An iced Americano."

She needed to cool her head.

As she ascended the stairs, she addressed Han Lichen, who blocked her path. "Move."

Leng Yue, who had just rushed down, tensed at her tone.

Han Lichen stepped aside without expression. "Fine."

They brushed past each other, neither sparing the other a glance.

Mu Li entered the tutoring room and sat down, lost in thought.

When Dong Cheng and the others arrived, they exchanged bewildered looks. Qin Sheng blurted out, "Boss, where's Brother-in-law?"

Brother-in-law?

So in everyone's eyes, it had always been him accompanying her?

Qin Sheng noticed her expression. "Boss, you look off."

Mu Li shook her head. "Take out your assignments."

The group sighed in relief, scrambling to pull out their textbooks.

Normally, Mu Li would have started lecturing by now, but today she just stared blankly at the homework.

They exchanged glances—something was definitely wrong with their boss.

Mu Li was distracted. Han Lichen's "You're ruthless," the way he had laughed with that woman, and his retreating figure earlier—all of it replayed in her mind.

Her chest tightened.

A knock broke the silence. Zou Ming entered with her coffee, sensing the odd atmosphere.

"Your Americano."

Mu Li nodded in thanks.

After he left, she took a sip and nearly choked.

It suddenly struck her that Han Lichen usually brewed her coffee himself.

The bitterness brought her back to reality.

By the time the tutoring session ended, dusk had fallen.

Mu Li packed her bag slowly. Dong Cheng asked worriedly, "Boss, are you sure you're okay?"

Her phone rang. Motioning for them to leave first, she stepped outside to answer.

"Xiao Li, could you come to the principal's office?" Principal Han's voice was warm.

Mu Li agreed.

"Wonderful! I'll have dinner prepared so we can talk over a meal." Principal Han hung up quickly, as if afraid she might refuse.

Mu Li sighed at her phone.

In the principal's office, three place settings were arranged on the dining table. Principal Han beamed. "Come, have a seat."
###Chapter 253

Sophia Laurent gave Adrian Valdemar no chance to back out.

At dawn the next day, Melanie Vance marched straight into Adrian's agent's office with the contract. His agent happened to be his college roommate—a blunt engineering graduate who knew nothing about the entertainment industry's underbelly.

Their PR strategy was shockingly simple: attack back.

Melanie nearly choked when she heard their approach.

Strangely enough, this crude method had earned Adrian a notorious reputation. Though most were haters, in an era where attention was currency, being talked about—even negatively—was better than obscurity.

At least it landed him some low-tier gigs.

After signing, Melanie tentatively asked Sophia, "Should we draft a career plan first?"

Sophia shook her head, her gaze fixed on Adrian. "Put him through eight-hour daily training for a week. Then send him to audition for Lucas Sheridan's 'Young Marquis.' I've already arranged it."

"Eight hours?" Melanie gasped but nodded.

Even Scarlett Ashcroft had only trained four hours a day at her peak.

Could this pampered young master endure it?

As Melanie hesitated, Sophia added coldly, "Assign someone to monitor him. If he slacks off, notify me immediately."

Adrian's eyes widened.

He was standing right there! Did she think he was invisible?

First training morning.

After two hours of facial expressions practice, Adrian collapsed onto the couch, playing dead.

Melanie immediately called Sophia.

Sophia was chairing an executive meeting at Valdemar Holdings. Since dealing with Director Huang, dissent had temporarily quieted.

"Make him continue," Sophia said icily. "If he doesn't complete eight hours, he's not leaving the company."

On her turf, her rules applied.

When Melanie relayed the message, Adrian exploded. "I quit!"

When had he ever suffered like this?

Two hours of exaggerated expressions left his face twitching.

"Ms. Laurent's orders," Melanie said flatly. "No eight hours, no going home."

Adrian froze. "Is Sophia insane?"

Eight hours? This was torture!

No matter how he raged, Melanie remained unmoved.

"Get Sophia here now!" Adrian roared, kicking over a chair. "Is she deliberately tormenting me?"

Melanie smiled. "Ms. Laurent is busy."

"Now! Immediately!" Adrian hurled the script across the room. "Or I'm terminating the contract!"
###Chapter 254

Adrian Valdemar ran his fingers through his hair in frustration.

As the most spoiled young master of the Valdemar family, he had lived in luxury since childhood, never experiencing hardship.

Acting lessons?

What a joke.

He'd rather lounge on the couch scrolling through short videos all day.

Moreover, he suspected Sophia was deliberately making things difficult for him.

Physical training, facial expressions—every exercise left him miserable.

The worst part was that even when he pushed through, his hands still trembled before the camera.

Melanie Croft sighed as she watched Adrian sprawled on the sofa.

She dialed Sophia's number.

Thirty minutes later.

Sophia pushed open the studio door to find Adrian lounging with crossed legs, absorbed in his phone.

"Quite the leisurely life, young master Valdemar," she remarked coldly.

Adrian's head snapped up.

"You dare show your face?" He sprang to his feet. "You're just torturing me on purpose!"

His words died in his throat.

Sophia was casually twirling a black leather whip.

"You're absolutely right," she said, flicking the whip. "I came specifically to discipline you."

Adrian instinctively took two steps back.

"You—"

"What?" Sophia arched an eyebrow. "Planning to tattle?"

Adrian's face flushed crimson.

He wanted to threaten reporting her to his grandfather, but remembering the patriarch's favoritism toward Sophia, he swallowed his words.

"I'll tell my brother!" he blurted instead.

Images from yesterday's visit to the sanatorium flashed through his mind.

The sight of Alexander lying motionless in bed made his chest tighten.

"Tell him when he wakes up." Sophia carelessly cracked the whip. "For now, you answer to me."

The whip's sharp snap made Adrian flinch.

"Have you lost your mind?" His eyes widened. "What kind of socialite carries a whip?"

Sophia smiled.

"Effective, isn't it?"

Adrian bit his lip.

"Four hours..." he negotiated weakly. "That's my limit."

Sophia pulled a document from her bag.

"Your medical report says you're perfectly healthy."

She slapped the papers onto the table.

"Eight hours. No excuses."

Adrian stared at the report, his expression shifting between disbelief and dread.

This woman had even dug up his private health records.
###Chapter 255

Success Never Favors the Lazy

Adrian Valdemar sprawled across the leather couch like a lifeless ragdoll.

"These acting classes are torture! I quit!"

A whip cracked through the air before he finished speaking.

Crack!

The lash struck the armrest mere inches from Adrian's thigh.

"Jesus Christ!"

He bolted upright so fast he nearly knocked over the coffee table.

"Are you insane, Sophia?"

His wide eyes locked onto the woman before him.

Sophia Laurent coiled the whip with deliberate slowness, her lips curling into a frosty smile.

"Is this all you've got?"

Adrian gritted his teeth.

"You psychotic witch!"

"Ruthless!"

"Deranged!"

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

"Such limited vocabulary."

Adrian's chest heaved with ragged breaths.

Regret churned in his gut.

Hiring this she-devil as his manager was the worst decision he'd ever made.

Instead of gaining advantages, he'd become her personal punching bag.

Ultimately, he found himself dragged to acting class anyway.

Professor Eloise Fairchild, a legendary figure in the industry, worked him to the bone.

By the end, Adrian couldn't even lift a finger.

His phone buzzed the moment he stepped outside.

"Bro, heard you're back in town. Drinks tonight?"

Julian Valdemar's voice carried through the receiver.

Adrian scoffed.

"Boring. Why waste time with you?"

"Then who would you rather drink with?" Julian's tone turned sharp.

"Pretty girls, obviously." Adrian's voice dripped with mockery.

Julian's voice dropped dangerously low.

"Must you always be so vulgar?"

"Oh? Since when did our precious third young master become a moral guardian?"

Adrian drew out each syllable with exaggerated flair.

"Speaking of which, isn't it past your curfew with that little flower of yours?"

Dead silence filled the line for several seconds.

"Adrian." Julian's voice turned glacial.

"Don't call Jasmine that."

"Why not?"

Adrian's smirk widened.

"Jasmine Keane, Jasmine Keane, Jasmine Keane—"

"Enough!" Julian's roar cut through his taunting.

"Keep this up, and I'll disown you as my brother."

Adrian's grin faltered for a split second.

"Like I care."

His tone remained light, but shadows flickered in his eyes.

The Valdemar brothers were cursed from birth.

Alexander, the eldest, was colder than ice—untouchable and detached.

Julian, the youngest, had lost all rationality over some girl.

That Jasmine girl was clearly trouble.

Yet Julian remained blindly devoted, deaf to all warnings.

Whatever.

Not his problem.

They were all destined to be abandoned anyway.

If even their parents couldn't love them, who would?

"At least I have principles," Julian shot back.

Adrian's laugh was bitter.

"Principles? Does your fiancée know about those?"
###Chapter 256

Julian Valdemar's fingers tightened around his phone.

Adrian Valdemar's careless voice came through the receiver. "Coming or not?"

"No." Julian refused bluntly.

He swallowed hard. "Can you lend me some money?"

Adrian raised an eyebrow. "Broke again?"

"It's Jasmine's birthday." Julian's voice dropped. "I want to buy her that necklace."

Adrian snorted. "The three-million-dollar one? Your account only has five hundred thousand left."

"I'll pay you back." Julian's tone turned stiff.

"Not happening." Adrian lounged on the sofa. "I'd rather throw cash in the river and hear the splash."

Julian's face darkened. "Adrian!"

"Relax." Adrian lowered his voice. "Why not... ask our sister-in-law?"

Julian froze. "Sophia Laurent?"

"She's managing Alexander's accounts now." Adrian coaxed. "She approved my contract termination fee last week."

Silence filled the line.

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "She just married into the Valdemar family. She'll have to show us some courtesy."

Julian clenched his fists. "Is she... approachable?"

"Warm, considerate, understanding." Adrian lied without blinking. "She treats this little brother so well."

Julian sounded doubtful. "Really?"

"Why would I lie?" Adrian cleared his throat. "I'm moving into Westmount Villa tonight."

In truth, Sophia was dragging him there for remedial lessons.

Julian finally relented. "I'll go see her now."

Hanging up, Adrian smirked.

He rubbed his sore arm, remembering Sophia's dreaded teaching rod.

"Contributing to the national economy..." he muttered. "What does she know about art investments?"
###Chapter 257

Adrian Valdemar had never felt so humiliated in his life.

He glared at the rattan cane in Sophia Laurent's hand, teeth clenched. The woman looked delicate, but her wrist carried surprising strength. A single strike left a red welt across his arm.

"Keep staring and I'll add two more hours," Sophia warned, swinging the cane.

Fuming, Adrian climbed into the car.

Then it hit him—Julian was about to endure the same torment. His lips curled into a smirk despite himself. The earlier scowl transformed into something almost gleeful.

"That's a sinister smile," Sophia observed, narrowing her eyes.

Adrian schooled his features. "Just facial spasms from exhaustion."

"Really?" Her tone was light. "You had no trouble calling me a she-devil earlier."

Adrian exhaled sharply and reclined his seat, feigning sleep.

Today had been hell. Eight hours of vocal training left his throat raw. And this woman had hovered over him with that damned cane, striking at every wrong note.

Sophia studied the furrow between his brows as he pretended to sleep.

The spoiled young master had no idea how privileged he was. Professor Fairchild rarely took private students. Without Sophia's past connection—saving the professor's granddaughter—this opportunity wouldn't exist.

Despite Adrian's rebellious attitude, he'd applied himself during lessons. Raw talent simmered beneath the surface. If only he'd commit...

Sophia massaged her temples. The audition loomed in a week. Adrian's skills paled compared to Scarlett's. If he failed to land the Young Marquis role, her entire plan would unravel.

The car glided into Westmount Villa's driveway.

Adrian lagged behind as they exited, trailing her like a shadow. Before Sophia could question his sudden hesitation, a crisp male voice called from the foyer:

"Welcome home, sister-in-law."

A young man in a white dress shirt stood in the entryway. Where Adrian radiated defiance, this one carried an air of effortless polish—the picture of an elite university graduate.

"Julian?" Sophia recalled the dossier. The second son of the Valdemar family's lesser branch.

The young man smiled. "What perfect timing for my visit."

Sophia caught Adrian's smug expression from the corner of her eye. The pieces clicked—this unannounced guest wasn't here by coincidence.
###Chapter 258

Adrian Valdemar's pupils contracted slightly when his gaze landed on Sophia Laurent.

The video footage hadn't done her justice.

She stood beneath the crystal chandelier, her skin like porcelain, features exquisitely painted.

"Thank you, sister-in-law." Adrian heard the slight tension in his own voice.

Sophia's lips curved as her eyes flicked toward Alexander. "Take notes."

Alexander snorted, shoving his hands into his pockets.

He'd deliberately remained silent all evening, waiting for this spectacle.

The housekeeper appeared at the perfect moment. "Dinner is served, madam."

Sophia touched her empty stomach. "Let's eat."

At the dining table, she focused entirely on the gourmet dishes before her.

Alexander suddenly sneered. "You eat like a starving stray."

Julian frowned. "Brother!"

"Does my eating bother you?" Sophia dabbed her lips with deliberate slowness. "Or is Second Young Master Valdemar simply bored?"

Alexander's face darkened. "I'm thinking of the family's reputation!"

"The Valdemar name," Sophia chuckled, "was already ruined by you."

Alexander nearly erupted until he caught Julian's puzzled expression.

He instantly switched tones. "Just joking. Sister-in-law is the most gracious."

Sophia watched his performance with cold detachment.

The lighting cast soft shadows from her long lashes, lending her an unexpected gentleness.

Julian nodded to himself. This sister-in-law seemed genuinely pleasant.

Sophia continued eating while observing both men from the corner of her eye.

Alexander's unusual behavior tonight undoubtedly involved this younger brother.

"I'm finished." She set down her utensils.

As expected, Julian spoke urgently. "Sister-in-law, actually I need to ask a favor..."
###Chapter 259

Sophia Laurent studied the refined man before her.

Julian Valdemar shifted uncomfortably under her obsidian gaze.

He took a deep breath and forced himself to speak. "Sophia, may I borrow three million? I'll repay you as soon as possible."

A loan request?

Sophia's eyebrow arched slightly.

Valdemar heirs weren't known for financial struggles.

Except perhaps Adrian, the family's notorious spendthrift.

Julian didn't strike her as the reckless type.

"Money isn't an issue," she said calmly. "But may I ask the purpose?"

Julian's ears turned pink.

"My girlfriend's birthday is coming up. I want to buy her a gift."

His voice dropped lower. "It's a substantial amount, but she deserves the best..."

Adrian snorted loudly.

"Three million for a birthday present?" He clutched his chest dramatically. "Julian, could you be any more pathetic?"

Sophia shot him a look.

Adrian rolled his eyes in response.

Julian's jaw tightened but remained silent.

He'd grown accustomed to Adrian's taunts since dating Jasmine.

His hopeful gaze returned to Sophia.

"Give me until morning," she said after consideration. "Why don't you stay the night? I'll have an answer by breakfast."

Julian brightened.

"Thank you for your hospitality."

He added quickly, "Alexander mentioned I could access his private account with proper authorization."

The implication being Sophia wouldn't need to provide the funds.

Julian exhaled in quiet relief.

Sophia nodded with a faint smile. "Understood."

"I'll retire for the evening."

"Of course. The butler will assist you."

Adrian gave a derisive sniff before following upstairs.

Though he despised Julian and Jasmine, he wouldn't interfere with Sophia's decision.

His instincts told him she wouldn't disappoint.

This drama would be worth watching.

Sophia watched them leave, lost in thought.

She retrieved her phone and texted her private investigator: Run a full background check on Julian Valdemar.
###Chapter 260

Sophia Laurent placed her phone back on the nightstand and turned toward the bathroom.

Warm water cascaded over her skin as steam condensed into droplets on the mirror.

When she emerged wrapped in a towel, her phone screen lit up.

The private investigator's report was concise.

Julian Valdemar, the third son of the Valdemar family, child of Victor Valdemar.

Victor and his wife resided overseas, rarely returning home.

Julian had been raised by Patriarch Valdemar, growing up alongside Adrian Valdemar.

The investigation revealed Julian and Jasmine Keane had met in college, their relationship blossoming naturally.

But a critical detail was highlighted in red at the end.

Julian was already engaged.

His fiancée, Tiffany Sinclair, hailed from the prestigious Sinclair family. Their arranged marriage had long been common knowledge in elite circles.

The engagement had been formalized before college.

Sophia's fingers glided across the screen.

One subtle detail caught her attention.

Jasmine had accepted a gift worth three million from Julian.

Outside, tree shadows swayed as moonlight cast dappled patterns on the floor.

Sophia locked her phone and set it gently on the nightstand.

Pulling up the velvet duvet, she recalled Julian's refined, jade-like smile.

What intentions lay behind that smile?

Morning sunlight filtered through sheer curtains, pooling at the edge of the bed.

Sophia stretched, her bare feet sinking into the plush carpet.

The minty toothpaste left a refreshing coolness in her mouth.

The clink of cutlery drifted up from downstairs.

Adrian lounged on the leather sofa, a glass held between his slender fingers.

His lips curved into a smile, the usual gloom in his eyes gone.

"Morning," he greeted, tilting his chin toward the staircase.

Sophia gave a slight nod. "Good morning."

Julian peered out from the dining room, anticipation written across his face.

"Sister-in-law, have you thought it over?"

His tone carried unwavering confidence.
###Chapter 261

Sophia's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold.

"I'm afraid that's not possible."

Her voice was soft yet firm.

"Three million is no small sum. Borrowing money to buy a gift? Your girlfriend would be heartbroken if she found out."

Julian froze.

He clearly hadn't considered that.

Adrian scoffed beside him.

"Please. That gold-digger of his wouldn't bat an eye at such petty cash."

Julian had tens of millions in savings.

Yet after just six months with Jasmine Keane, he was reduced to borrowing money. The woman's skills were impressive.

"Adrian!" Julian's face darkened.

"Jasmine isn't like that."

He spent money on her willingly.

Sophia studied Julian's earnest expression, curious about this girl she'd never met.

What kind of woman could inspire such devotion?

"The value of a gift lies in its sentiment."

"Even a handmade trinket can touch someone's heart if given with sincerity."

It wasn't the amount that concerned her.

She sensed Julian was heading for trouble.

The Sinclairs weren't to be trifled with.

Julian frowned.

"So you refuse?"

His tone turned pointed. "Just say the word to Henry. It's that simple."

To him, Sophia was making a mountain out of a molehill.

Why antagonize him over something so trivial?

Sophia ignored the implication, nodding calmly.

"I know."

The Valdemar brothers only needed her or Alexander's approval for funds.

Given their attitudes, this clearly wasn't their first request.

The ruthless Alexander Valdemar was surprisingly indulgent with his brothers.

Had it been her, she'd have disciplined a troublemaker like Adrian long ago.

Julian's expression turned stormy.

Adrian whistled.

"Bravo."

He smirked gleefully. "I may be no saint, but even I wouldn't waste three million on some gold-digger. That money could fund dozens of scholarships."

"Shut up!" Julian glared.

"Make me." Adrian tilted his chin defiantly.

He'd known Sophia wouldn't budge.

If even he couldn't get money from her, Julian's ridiculous request stood no chance.

Neglecting his fiancée to spoil his mistress? Pathetic.
###Chapter 262

The Three Million Gap

Had Alexander Valdemar been present, he wouldn't have batted an eye.

A mere three million was pocket change to him.

Julian Valdemar clenched his fists until his knuckles turned white.

His gaze darkened as it swept over Sophia Laurent's face. "Since you're unwilling to budge, I won't waste your time."

"Goodbye." Sophia didn't even blink.

Adrian Valdemar studied her reaction with amusement.

"Not even going to give him an out? Julian grew up with us."

He deliberately drew out his words. "What will you say when my brother wakes up?"

Sophia lifted her teacup. The surface remained perfectly still.

"Business is business between brothers. Any problem with that?"

Adrian's mouth twitched.

He suddenly remembered the consequences of his own last request for money.

Compared to getting beaten up, Julian had gotten off easy.

After breakfast, Adrian strode into Pearl Entertainment with a stormy expression.

Melanie Vance hesitated when she saw his mood.

"Have you seen... the news online?"

Adrian lazily lifted his gaze.

"What are they accusing me of this time?"

He was long accustomed to this treatment.

Melanie bit back a laugh, her shoulders shaking slightly.

"The 'Love You Forever' production team released a statement saying you acted like a diva..."

She handed him a tablet playing a video clip.

The footage showed Adrian coldly telling the director, "I quit," before walking off set.

The comments section was in an uproar.

[No surprise from the king of bad movies]

[Who does he think he is with that terrible acting?]

Adrian stared at the screen before letting out a mirthless laugh.

"Funny how they never showed this editing talent during filming."
###Chapter 263

Adrian Valdemar threw the script onto the floor again.

"I can't do this anymore." His voice was icy as he turned to leave.

The assistant director hurried after him. "Mr. Valdemar, please be patient—"

"Patient?" Adrian scoffed. "I've been patient long enough."

The crew members lowered their heads, pretending not to witness the scene.

Melanie Croft rushed over and pulled Adrian into the dressing room.

"What's the problem now?" she whispered sharply.

Adrian leaned back on the couch, eyes closed, refusing to speak.

Melanie sighed. "I know you're upset, but we need to handle this carefully."

She handed him an iced americano. "Cool down first."

Adrian took the cup, his fingers trembling slightly.

"Eight more hours of acting class today?" he asked suddenly.

Melanie nodded. "Professor Fairchild is waiting for you."

Adrian slammed the coffee onto the table and stood up.

Sophia Laurent stood outside the door, discreetly recording everything on her phone.

She scrolled through her gallery and found the video she'd been saving.

On screen, Director Chen was berating Adrian.

"Even an extra could act better than you!"

Adrian stood under the scorching sun, sweat dripping from his chin.

He didn't argue. His fists clenched silently.

Sophia sent the video to Melanie.

"Release it," she said.

Thirty minutes later, Pearl Entertainment's official account updated.

A high-definition video with a caption:

"The truth will never stay silent."

The internet exploded.

"Is that... Adrian Valdemar?"

"I thought he was the one causing trouble on set?"

Comments flooded in.

"That director went way too far..."

"So he was the one being bullied all along?"

Someone noticed the details.

"Wait, this was posted by Pearl Entertainment?"

Soon, #AdrianValdemarJoinsPearl trended.

"Didn't every agency blacklist him?"

"Is Pearl insane? Signing someone like that?"

But more people demanded answers.

"Shouldn't the production team explain this?"

The official account of Fleeting Love was instantly bombarded.

Adrian sat in the acting studio, his phone buzzing nonstop.

He glanced at the screen and smirked.

Professor Fairchild frowned. "Focus."

"Professor," Adrian looked up. "Can we end early today?"

"Why?"

"Because..." He waved his phone. "I have justice to serve."
###Chapter 264

The production team of "Love You Forever" released a video exposing Adrian Valdemar's diva behavior. The internet erupted instantly.

Director Chen stared at the skyrocketing engagement metrics, a cold smirk playing on her lips.

"Who does he think he is?"

She scrolled through her phone dismissively, taking in the flood of vitriol directed at Adrian.

The two-million-dollar penalty fee seemed like a done deal in her mind.

But her smirk froze abruptly.

Pearl Entertainment's official statement hit like a sledgehammer, completely reversing public opinion.

"This can't be happening!"

Director Chen's fingers trembled as she clutched her phone.

The comment section had already exploded.

"Is this production team insane? Did the director hit early menopause?"

"I'm no Adrian fan, but I'm siding with him this time."

"The director's insults were worse than the haters'. How did Adrian endure that?"

Her assistant hesitantly offered a tablet. "Director, our official account is trending for all the wrong reasons..."

"Shut up!"

Director Chen hurled the tablet to the ground.

She never expected this powerless newcomer to gain influential backing overnight.

Meanwhile, Adrian was undergoing intensive training in the rehearsal room.

"Channel the emotions properly." Professor Fairchild tapped the script. "This smile needs three parts sarcasm, seven parts aloofness."

Adrian nodded mechanically, his mind elsewhere.

Seizing a moment when the instructor stepped out, he fished out his phone.

His social media notifications had maxed out.

He went straight to the "Love You Forever" official page.

His fingertips turned icy during the few seconds the video loaded.

But the comments left him stunned.

"?"

Adrian refreshed repeatedly, doubting his own eyes.

The same netizens who'd once hurled abuse at him were now defending him.
###Chapter 265

Under the crystal chandelier of Celestial Pavilion, Adrian Valdemar wore a cold smirk.

His slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the tabletop.

His gaze drifted toward Julian Valdemar's table nearby.

"What an unpleasant coincidence," he muttered.

Sophia Laurent followed his line of sight.

Julian was pouring tea attentively for a girl beside him.

The young woman wore a white dress, her black hair cascading like a waterfall.

Her delicate features held a touch of vulnerability.

"Three million in gifts?" Sophia sipped her tea. "Must be true love."

Adrian scoffed. "True love?"

Mockery flickered in his eyes.

"That's Natalie Lockwood. A music conservatory student."

"Julian's been chasing her for three months. Hasn't even held her hand yet."

Sophia nodded thoughtfully.

Just then, a striking figure approached Julian's table.

"What a coincidence, Mr. Valdemar."

The newcomer wore a red dress with bold crimson lips, radiating confidence.

Adrian's eyes lit up.

"The show begins."

Sophia recognized the rising starlet Scarlett Winslow.

Scarlett looked down at Natalie with disdain.

"And who is this?"

Julian's expression shifted.

"My friend."

Natalie instinctively leaned closer to Julian.

Scarlett's red lips curved.

"Friend?"

She gave Julian a meaningful glance.

"That's not what you said last night in my bed."

Natalie's face drained of color.

Adrian couldn't suppress a laugh.

"Brilliant."

Sophia shot him a look.

"Your doing?"

Adrian raised his hands innocently.

"I merely knew Scarlett had dinner reservations here tonight."

A glint of mischief flashed in his eyes.

"The rest was fate."

Chaos erupted at Julian's table.

Natalie stood up with tear-filled eyes.

"You lied to me, Julian!"

She grabbed her purse to leave.

Adrian watched the scene with glee.

"There goes the three-million-dollar gift."

Sophia shook her head.

"Aren't you afraid Julian will retaliate?"

Adrian took a casual sip of tea.

"Why worry?"

His gaze met Sophia's, suddenly serious.

"I have you."

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

"That much faith in me?"

Adrian turned away.

"You're my sister-in-law, after all."

His quiet words sent an unexpected warmth through Sophia.

In the distance, Julian scrambled after the fleeing Natalie.

Scarlett remained standing, blowing Adrian a kiss.

He raised his teacup in silent salute.

Sophia observed it all.

This dinner had turned out far more entertaining than expected.
###Chapter 266

Julian Valdemar pushed open the gates of Westmount Villa with a face dark as storm clouds.

Only when his phone buzzed with the confirmation of a transferred sum did his tense shoulders relax slightly. He immediately dialed Jasmine Keane's number, arranging to meet at the newly opened French restaurant downtown.

Inside the elegant dining room, their heads bent together over a travel website on Jasmine's phone.

"How about the Maldives?" Her slender finger swiped across the screen. "It's perfect for your birthday next week."

Before Julian could respond, a familiar voice came from behind.

"Julian?"

His head snapped up, the smile freezing on his face.

Tiffany Sinclair stood by their table in a simple white blouse and jeans. Surprise flickered across her round face as her fingers twisted unconsciously around her purse strap.

Adrian Valdemar shoved his chair back with a loud scrape.

"What's with the attitude?" He stalked over, eyes sharp. "You own this place now?"

Julian's eyes narrowed. "Mind your own business, Adrian."

"Making it my business." Adrian shoved hands in pockets, looking down his nose. "Cut the righteous act."

Nearby diners turned to watch the scene unfold.

Tiffany tugged gently at Adrian's sleeve. "Perhaps I interrupted..."

She turned to Julian, voice soft. "I just saw you and wanted to say hello."

A cold smirk twisted Julian's lips. "We're not that close."

Jasmine leaned into his shoulder, blinking wide innocent eyes at them both.

From a nearby booth, Sophia Laurent observed the exchange silently.

Tiffany's lashes lowered, casting shadows across her cheeks. But she quickly summoned a polite smile. "I understand."

As she turned to leave, Adrian caught her wrist.

"That's it?" He looked incredulous. "He treats you like that and you just walk away?"

Tiffany's eyes widened. As the Sinclair heiress, proper decorum had been drilled into her since childhood.

Yet his words warmed her unexpectedly.

"Thank you," she murmured.

Adrian faltered. He'd expected fireworks, not this quiet grace.

"You better mean that." He raked a hand through his hair. "Don't let him ruin your appetite. Join us?"

He quickly added, "Not just me. My sister-in-law's here too."

Following his gaze, Tiffany saw Sophia give a slight nod.

After a brief hesitation, she accepted.
###Chapter 267

Tiffany Sinclair's lips curved slightly as she gave Adrian Valdemar a graceful nod. "I appreciate your efforts."

She wore a pale pink satin cheongsam with a cream chiffon shawl draped over her shoulders, every movement exuding aristocratic elegance.

Adrian trailed behind her, his gaze downcast and distracted.

"Mrs. Valdemar, I'm Tiffany Sinclair."

The Valdemar Group's recent upheavals had sent ripples through the entire business circle.

Sophia Laurent's interim appointment as CEO in Alexander's stead had caused quite a stir.

She wouldn't meet Adrian alone, but she wouldn't pass up the chance to make Sophia's acquaintance.

Sophia studied the poised young woman before extending her hand. "Miss Sinclair."

She hadn't expected to meet the subject of yesterday's background check so soon.

Their exchange remained polite yet measured.

Neither overly familiar nor coldly distant.

Sophia found herself favorably impressed.

Adrian's incessant chatter had ceased the moment Tiffany appeared.

Meanwhile...

Adrian watched their animated conversation with a deepening frown.

What could they possibly have to talk about?

Jasmine Keane noticed his mood and tugged gently at his sleeve. "Adrian, is that your sister-in-law? Should we greet her?"

She was the one Adrian had chosen, not some arranged marriage candidate.

Adrian nodded. "Let me introduce you."

Though Sophia had refused his loan request, she was still the lady of the house.

Just as Sophia and Tiffany's discussion grew lively, Adrian's voice cut in.

"Sister-in-law..."

Adrian lifted lazy eyes. "Shouldn't you be on a date instead of interrupting?"

Both women turned at the intrusion.

"Is there something you need?"

"Nothing important." Adrian shook his head. "Sister-in-law, this is my girlfriend Jasmine Keane."

Before he finished, Jasmine chirped sweetly, "Hello, sister-in-law."

Sophia's smile cooled.

"That's premature."

The unspoken implication: a girlfriend was far from being a Valdemar wife.

Jasmine bit her lip, fingers twisting nervously. "My apologies, I was just following Adrian's lead..."

Her white sundress and demure posture painted a pitiful picture.

Adrian bristled before Sophia could respond.

"What's that supposed to mean, Sophia?"

Only out of respect for Alexander did he address her as sister-in-law.

Everyone knew she was just a temporary placeholder.

He'd shown enough courtesy, yet she dared embarrass Jasmine in public.

He could tolerate personal slights, but never against his beloved.

Sophia's lips quirked.

"Simply stating facts."
###Chapter 268

Sophia Laurent studied Jasmine Keane's tearful expression, her lips curling into a cold smile.

"What gives you the right to call me sister-in-law?"

Jasmine's face instantly paled.

Julian Valdemar immediately stepped protectively in front of her. "Sophia, don't push your luck."

"Pushing my luck?" Sophia chuckled lightly. "Then what do you call publicly humiliating your fiancée?"

She deliberately glanced at Tiffany Sinclair standing nearby.

Julian's expression darkened as he turned to Tiffany. "Miss Sinclair, I will never marry you. Stop targeting Jasmine."

Adrian Valdemar burst out laughing.

"Are you out of your mind? What does this have to do with her?"

Julian flushed with anger. "If someone hadn't stirred trouble, why would she have issues with Jasmine?"

Sophia remained silent, smiling knowingly.

Her deliberate mention of the familial title had been a test to gauge their reactions.

Clearly, Jasmine had said something to provoke their approach.

Adrian scoffed. "If anyone's talking trash, it's me. Why are you biting at random people?"

"Do you even know her to be defending her like this?" Julian challenged.

Adrian shrugged. "Can't a man stand up for justice?"

Furious, Julian turned to leave. "Jasmine, let's go."

Adrian called after them, "Run faster!"

Jasmine cast one last lingering look at Adrian before leaving.

Tiffany maintained her polite smile, though it never reached her eyes.

Sophia leisurely stirred her chicken soup, observing everything with quiet amusement.

After studying Tiffany for a long moment, Adrian suddenly asked, "Aren't you angry?"

Tiffany blinked. "Angry?"

She seemed genuinely puzzled by the question.
###Chapter 269

But what good would anger do?

What could she possibly change?

Tiffany Sinclair lowered her gaze, fingertips lightly tracing the rim of her cup.

Arranged marriages among wealthy families were inevitable—she'd known that since childhood.

Julian Valdemar was refined and cultured. Before Jasmine Keane entered the picture, she hadn't objected to the match.

Now...

She pressed her lips together.

Adrian Valdemar's expression darkened instantly.

"Pathetic," he sneered.

Tiffany chuckled at his reaction.

Sophia Laurent studied them thoughtfully.

"Miss Sinclair," she said suddenly, "do you still wish to marry Julian?"

Tiffany's fingers tightened slightly.

Tiny ripples disturbed the water in her glass.

"I'll follow my family's wishes," she murmured.

Sophia nodded.

She had her answer.

Adrian viciously bit into a rib, his eyes stormy.

Back at the office, Sophia dialed Julian's number.

"You don't want this marriage?"

Julian was standing in a long queue to buy Jasmine's favorite bubble tea.

"Of course not," he answered without hesitation.

"What if I could dissolve the engagement for you?"

Julian's eyes lit up. "Really?"

"Naturally." Sophia's laughter was light. "As your elder sister-in-law, it's my duty."

Julian remained skeptical.

"How exactly would you manage that?"

"Are you absolutely certain Jasmine truly loves you?"

"Without question!" Julian declared firmly.

Sophia stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the city lights below.

"What if... you were no longer the third son of the Valdemar family?"

Julian froze.

"Jasmine would love me regardless of my status."

Sophia couldn't suppress a laugh.

"Fine."

"I'll announce your disownment from the Valdemar family."

"If after one year Jasmine still stands by you, I'll persuade Grandfather to cancel the engagement."

"Do you dare take that bet?"
###Chapter 270

Julian Valdemar's brow furrowed slightly as his fingers tapped lightly against the desk. "Are you certain?"

A single year—he had absolute confidence in himself.

"Without a doubt." Sophia Laurent's voice was ice-cold.

Julian narrowed his eyes. "Why should I trust you?"

After all, Sophia was merely a temporary figurehead thrust into power by the Valdemar family.

The Patriarch's favor toward her now didn't guarantee it would last forever.

"Do you have any other choice?" Sophia chuckled.

The arranged marriage had been decided by Patriarch Valdemar. The Sinclairs wouldn't dare back out easily.

If Julian truly wanted to marry Jasmine Keane, this was his only opportunity.

Of course, if he was just toying around, that was another matter entirely.

More importantly, Sophia now controlled the lifeblood of the Valdemar empire.

She could freeze Julian's assets at any moment, even forbid all Valdemars from associating with him.

After a long silence, Julian finally spoke. "Deal. I expect you to keep your word."

"Naturally." Sophia twirled a pen between her fingers. "But there's one more condition."

"Go on."

"Not a single word to Jasmine Keane this entire year. Break this rule, and our agreement is void."

Julian nodded without hesitation.

Telling Jasmine would render the entire plan meaningless.

"Then it's settled." Sophia ended the call with crisp efficiency.

Inside the shopping mall, Julian turned with two bubble teas in hand.

Jasmine stood a short distance away, her eyes brimming with adoration.

He returned her gaze with a tender smile, though inwardly, he breathed a sigh of relief.

Just one year. Jasmine loved him so deeply—how could her heart possibly change?

The marriage alliance had been decided by both families' patriarchs. No one could alter that.

His parents, perpetually abroad, couldn't care less about his marital affairs.

If the Sinclairs refused to annul the engagement, he'd eventually have to marry Tiffany Sinclair.

Sophia's assistance might not be such a bad thing after all.

——

Top floor of Valdemar Holdings.

The moment Sophia set down the phone, she summoned Henry Chamberlain.

"Effective immediately, freeze all of Julian Valdemar's accounts. Revoke every privilege he holds within Valdemar Holdings."

"Publicly announce that Julian is no longer affiliated with the Valdemar family."

Henry's eyes widened in shock. "You're serious?"

Had he misheard?

Was Sophia actually expelling the second young master of the Valdemars?

Taking in Sophia's steely expression, Henry realized the gravity of the situation.

The newly appointed CEO wasn't bluffing.

She meant every word.
###Chapter 271

Sophia's fingers tapped lightly on the desk, the crisp sound echoing through the office.

She lifted her gaze to Henry. "Do I need to repeat myself, Mr. Chamberlain?"

Her phoenix eyes were dark as frozen lakes. Though her tone remained calm, Henry felt cold sweat trickle down his back.

Henry swallowed hard. "Understood. But... are you certain about this?"

"Absolutely." Sophia's voice left no room for argument.

After a hesitant pause, Henry finally spoke up. "Madam, young master Julian—"

"Does being lovestruck count as a valid reason?" Sophia interrupted.

Her fingertip swiped across the tablet screen displaying Jasmine Keane's social media profile. The latest post showed a selfie flaunting a million-dollar diamond ring with the caption "Thank you, darling."

Julian's credit card statement revealed this was already his third seven-figure purchase this month.

Henry fell silent.

The third young master's dramatic romance had long been gossip fodder among elite circles.

From limited-edition sports cars to private islands, Julian had nearly drained his trust fund to please his girlfriend. With his arranged marriage to Tiffany Sinclair imminent, this timing was...

"I'll contact the bank immediately." Henry reached for his phone. "The internal memo will be circulated within ten minutes."

Sophia gave a slight nod.

She wanted everyone to know—from this moment onward, Julian Valdemar was no longer associated with the Valdemar family.

The news spread through Valdemar Holdings like wildfire.

The executive group chat exploded first:
"This must be a joke! Julian is the patriarch's grandson!"
"Henry, was your account hacked?"

Henry's reply silenced them all: "Direct order from Madam Valdemar."

Three minutes later, the company-wide email blast went out.

Five minutes later, business partners began calling for confirmation.

Eight minutes later, Jasmine's livestream abruptly cut off—right as she was showing off a new crocodile leather bag purchased with Julian's now-frozen supplementary card.
###Chapter 272

The merry-go-round's cheerful melody played on loop, but Julian Valdemar's phone kept vibrating relentlessly.

"Are you insane? Cutting ties with the Valdemars?" His friend's incredulous voice made Julian pause mid-step.

He instantly knew Sophia Laurent had made her move.

"Something like that." His reply was deliberately vague. "You know I've never seen eye to eye with the family."

A sharp inhale came through the receiver.

"The engagement cancellation—you're serious? Fooling around before marriage is one thing, but actually going through with it?"

Julian's gaze hardened. "I don't joke about these matters."

After a long silence, his friend offered weak consolation. "The Patriarch will cool down eventually—"

"Mhm." Julian ended the call without elaboration.

Across the amusement park, Jasmine Keane's phone also buzzed to life.

"Jasmine! Your boyfriend just got disowned by the Valdemars!"

"Don't be ridiculous." She scoffed.

As if the Valdemars would exile their own bloodline heir.

"My cousin works at Valdemar Holdings. The news is everywhere—"

Jasmine hung up and frantically opened social media.

Julian's name dominated the trending list.

Her smile froze.

Screenshots from Valdemar's internal chat groups had gone viral. Henry Chamberlain's calculated leaks fueled the wildfire.

"Valdemar heir cast out?"

"Lost a power struggle?"

Netizens speculated wildly.

Jasmine's lips curled in disdain.

What did these ignorant plebeians understand? Even at his lowest, Julian remained Valdemar royalty—a fallen phoenix still outshone common sparrows.

"Julian, are you okay?" She injected false concern into her voice.

His expression darkened. "Jasmine, I may have to disappoint you."

"What do you mean?" Her nails dug into her palms.

"I chose to break the engagement. The Patriarch issued an ultimatum." His tone was eerily calm.

Beneath her manicure, crescent marks bloomed on Jasmine's skin.

What value did a Valdemar without the family name hold?

The carousel music screeched to a halt.

Dark clouds gathered over the amusement park.
###Chapter 273

Jasmine Keane's fingertips trembled slightly. "What choice?"

"First, marry Tiffany Sinclair and cut all ties with you."
Julian Valdemar's gaze was steady.

"Second, break off the engagement and leave the Valdemar family."

Jasmine's heart skipped a beat.

"I choose you." Julian grasped her hand. "Even if it means losing everything."

She nearly gritted her teeth to dust.

Leave the Valdemars?
What was the point of all her careful planning then?

"What's wrong?" Julian noticed her stiffness. "You don't want to?"

Jasmine quickly painted on a sweet smile. "Of course I do. It's just... sudden."

She leaned against his shoulder. "The Patriarch dotes on you. Once he cools down—"

Julian didn't respond. Instead, he asked, "Can I stay at your place tonight?"

He had nowhere else to go.

"Of course." Jasmine blinked her dewy eyes. "I'll stay with you no matter what."

Warmth flooded Julian's chest.

When the news broke, Sophia Laurent was reviewing documents.

She didn't even look up.

Adrian Valdemar stared at his phone screen and suddenly laughed.

"Brutal."

He hadn't expected Sophia to actually banish Julian from the family.

"Bravo!" He couldn't resist calling Julian. "How's slumming it, Third Young Master?"

The call ended abruptly.

When he redialed, only a busy tone answered.

Adrian raised an eyebrow.

Blocked?

He hummed cheerfully.

This would be entertaining.

Let's see how long this hothouse flower could survive the storm.
###Chapter 274

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the Valdemar Sanatorium. Patriarch Valdemar sipped his tea leisurely, his expression uncharacteristically relaxed.

Alexander Valdemar had just completed his routine medical examination. The nurses wheeled him back to his room. His attending physician flipped through the test results, a pleased smile spreading across his face.

"Your recovery is progressing better than expected. You can begin rehabilitation training in another month."

This meant Alexander would finally escape the confines of his bed. Soon, he could move about in a wheelchair.

The atmosphere in the room lightened instantly.

Once the doctor left, Patriarch Valdemar set down his teacup and studied his grandson with concern.

"How do you feel?"

"Fine." Alexander's tone was flat. "I can handle company affairs now."

"Don't rush." The old man shook his head. "Sophia is managing everything beautifully. Focus on healing."

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly.

The image of that slender figure flashed through his mind. He pressed his lips together and remained silent.

"This arrangement works perfectly—Sophia handles matters publicly while you strategize behind the scenes." Patriarch Valdemar lowered his voice. "This time, we'll root out every last one of your father's people."

At the mention of Vincent Valdemar, Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

The car crash had been no accident. His father was undoubtedly involved.

Though concrete evidence remained elusive, the prime suspects were Sebastian Valdemar and his mother.

After all, they stood to gain the most from Alexander's demise.

Following the incident, Patriarch Valdemar had expelled Sebastian and Genevieve Roche from the company in a fit of rage.

Years ago, when Alexander hadn't yet taken control, Valdemar Holdings had been under Vincent's thumb.

Genevieve, once Vincent's secretary, was ruthlessly effective.

And Vincent had fallen for her tricks.

Not only had he betrayed Alexander's mother, driving her into depression, but he'd also flaunted his relationship with Genevieve once Sebastian reached his teens, forcing his lawful wife to divorce.

To this day, Patriarch Valdemar couldn't comprehend what spell Genevieve had cast over his son.

For her, Vincent had betrayed his own family, leaving the old man ashamed to face his longtime friends.

Over the years, Vincent and Genevieve had planted numerous loyalists within the company.

The moment Alexander was hospitalized, these snakes began stirring.

Many documents sent to Patriarch Valdemar and Sophia contained hidden traps.

Some were so cleverly disguised that even the old man had to scrutinize them repeatedly to spot the issues.

Yet according to Henry Chamberlain's reports, Sophia consistently identified every discrepancy with pinpoint accuracy.

Lately, Patriarch Valdemar had grown increasingly impressed with his granddaughter-in-law.

Now was the perfect time to purge Vincent's influence.

"Understood." Alexander's voice was icy. "I won't show mercy this time."

The two men discussed corporate strategies in detail.

As their conversation wound down, Patriarch Valdemar asked casually, "What are your true feelings for Sophia?"

Alexander stiffened slightly.

A complex emotion flickered in his dark eyes.

"That girl has shown you extraordinary devotion." The old man's tone turned meaningful. "Not only did she marry you when your survival was uncertain, but she also stepped up to save the company. You mustn't fail her—"

After a long pause, Alexander exhaled slowly. "I know."

"By the way." Patriarch Valdemar suddenly remembered something. "That worthless brother of yours is back in the country. Has he visited?"

Alexander gave a slight nod. "The guards said he lingered outside my room briefly."

"That disgrace!" The old man slammed his fist on the table. "Wasting his life on god-knows-what instead of making something of himself—"

At the mention of Adrian Valdemar, the air in the room turned frosty.
###Chapter 275

Everything that night began with the glass of wine Adrian Valdemar handed him.

Without that drink, there would have been no absurdity.

Without Tiffany Morrison, he and Sophia Laurent...

Alexander Valdemar closed his eyes.

There were no what-ifs in this world.

But Adrian had indeed grown increasingly reckless lately.

That brat needed proper discipline.

However, with the current tense situation, he had to suppress the thought for now.

"Even worse, he went looking for trouble with Sophia, spouting outrageous nonsense..."

Patriarch Valdemar's words made Alexander's gaze turn icy.

He immediately called Henry Chamberlain.

"Bring Adrian to see me tonight."

Henry had just finished dealing with Julian Valdemar's mess when he received the call.

The frigid tone on the other end made his temple throb.

Young Master Adrian truly had a talent for courting death.

Even Alexander, recuperating in the sanatorium, could be provoked by him.

"Understood. I'll bring him later."

Patriarch Valdemar observed his grandson's darkened expression and wisely chose not to press further.

"Rest now. I'll handle some matters."

"Hmm."

Once the door closed, Alexander stared at the ceiling.

But the image that surfaced in his mind was Sophia's radiant, unrestrained smile.

At 3 PM, Henry arrived early at Pearl Entertainment.

He'd known about Adrian signing with them for a while.

Since Patriarch Valdemar hadn't commented, he pretended ignorance.

But now, standing outside the training room, he froze.

Inside, Adrian was practicing posture with a movement coach.

His white T-shirt clung to his lean frame, damp with sweat.

Henry had never seen Adrian so focused before.

The young marquis in Empress was a prodigal son, but with the inherent dignity of a military family's heir.

The later battlefield scenes required an even sharper presence.

Currently, Adrian was holding a horse stance.

Veins bulged on his arms, sweat beading on his forehead.

His entire body trembled slightly, yet he gritted his teeth and persisted.

Henry watched, mesmerized.

Only when the eight-hour session ended and Adrian collapsed did he finally enter.

"Henry!" Adrian's eyes lit up. "Are you here to save me?"

Henry adjusted his glasses. "Mr. Valdemar wants to see you."

Adrian's face fell instantly. "No."

The old man only had eyes for that vixen Sophia now.

This meeting would bring nothing good.

Henry offered a professional smile. "I'm afraid that's not up to you."
###Chapter 276

Adrian Valdemar slumped in the passenger seat, exhausted from eight hours of intense training.

He shot a sideways glance at Henry Chamberlain.

"Henry, what does the old man want with me?"

Henry cleared his throat. "You'll find out when we arrive."

Adrian scoffed. "Since when does that geezer have good news?"

His mind raced with escape plans.

The scenery outside the window blurred past.

Jumping out was too risky.

Adrian reassured himself.

The old man couldn't do anything drastic anyway.

At least he'd get a free meal out of it.

He relaxed into the seat.

One hour later, they arrived at the sanatorium lobby.

Adrian froze mid-step.

"This isn't the way to the old man's suite."

Henry offered a professional smile. "Mr. Alexander requested your presence."

Adrian's pupils constricted.

He spun on his heel to flee.

Henry anticipated the move, seizing his wrist.

"After you, young master."

Adrian whined pitifully. "Henry, cut me some slack..."

The assistant remained impassive, dragging him forward.

Adrian struggled the entire way.

At the hospital room door, he suddenly went still.

He clung to Henry's arm like a lifeline.

"Put in a good word for me, okay?"

Henry pried his fingers loose. "Compose yourself."

Adrian swallowed hard.

The door swung open, releasing a wave of icy air.

Adrian met Alexander's glacial stare.

He turned to bolt.

The door slammed shut behind him.

Adrian stiffened before forcing a grimace that resembled a smile.

"Brother... you're awake."

Alexander's voice cut like winter wind. "Have I been too lenient with you?"

Adrian hunched his shoulders.

"I was just looking out for you—"

"Still unrepentant." The temperature dropped further.

A chill crawled down Adrian's spine.

The gravity of his mistake finally registered.

"Brother, I swear I'll never—"

A sudden realization struck him.

Had he actually slept with some hideous creature?

Alexander's frigid gaze pinned him in place.

"You're not a child anymore."

Adrian nodded frantically. "It won't happen again!"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "And?"

Adrian blinked. "And... what?"
###Chapter 277

Adrian Valdemar froze in place.

Aside from that one incident, he hadn't done anything particularly outrageous recently. His brother usually turned a blind eye to his minor antics.

Alexander's icy gaze swept over him. "And learn some restraint."

Adrian looked baffled.

This was just how he operated.

Everyone who knew him had been on the receiving end of his teasing—even Patriarch Valdemar, whom he often irreverently called "old man."

When Adrian remained silent, Alexander tapped the hospital bed with his slender fingers. "No allowance for six months."

"No way!" Adrian nearly jumped out of his skin. "You might as well kill me!"

He burned through money like water. How was he supposed to survive half a year with empty pockets?

"Bro, I messed up. It won't happen again..."

He'd rather take a beating than lose his spending money.

"Just hit me instead?"

Alexander smirked. "You think that's all?"

Adrian's eyes widened. "There's more?"

"Bring in security."

Before the words fully left Alexander's mouth, a security guard entered with a riding crop.

"Apologies, Young Master."

Adrian's agonized howls soon filled the room.

"Not so hard! Not there—bro, I swear I've learned my lesson!"

Regret twisted his insides.

Now he'd lost his allowance and gotten a thrashing.

Only when Adrian collapsed onto the sofa, no longer dodging, did Alexander signal for the punishment to stop.

"Remember this."

Drugging someone was unforgivable.

Gasping weakly on the couch, Adrian wheezed, "Got it..."

He'd definitely crossed a line this time.

Just as he thought the ordeal was over, Alexander's voice dropped lower.

"One more thing. Show Sophia Laurent proper respect."

Adrian almost rolled off the sofa.

"Bro, don't tell me you actually like her?"

He strongly suspected today's beating was Sophia-related.

Alexander's expression didn't flicker. "Nonsense."

Turning away, he ordered Henry Chamberlain, "Take him to get treated, then send him home."

"Yes, sir."

Henry glanced at Adrian. "Need help walking?"

Adrian scowled. "Do I look like I do?"

Henry studied him seriously. "Not particularly."

Adrian snorted. "Get me a stretcher then..."

Henry: "..."

Soon, Adrian was carried out on a stretcher.

His phone rang—Sophia's name flashed on the screen.

Henry immediately warned, "Young Master, Mr. Valdemar's awakening must remain confidential. No leaks."

Adrian looked surprised. "She doesn't know?"

Henry shook his head gravely. "Not yet."
###Chapter 278

Adrian Valdemar felt a surge of complicated emotions after Henry Chamberlain's warning.

He had always held prejudices against Sophia Laurent. But now, he had to admit she genuinely cared for him and his brother.

Any other gold-digging woman would have handed over money without hesitation. Only Sophia would impose restrictions.

Seeing Henry's solemn expression, Adrian grew even more unsettled.

When Sophia called, his tone softened involuntarily.

"Sophia, what's up?"

Her brows furrowed at his uncharacteristic gentleness.

Had he gotten into trouble again?

Why did he sound so guilty?

"Melanie said you left work early. Where are you?"

His eyes darted away. "Grandfather invited me for dinner. Want to join?"

"No." She paused. "Check your email. I sent you the audition script for the Young Marquis role."

To her surprise, Adrian complied without argument. "Got it."

His cooperation was unexpected, but she didn't dwell on it.

Lately, handling Valdemar Group affairs had become second nature to her.

Even the troublemakers within the company had quieted down.

After entrusting the film project to Adrian, she focused on her own work.

Soon, audition day arrived.

Returning to the film studio, Adrian's mindset had completely transformed.

Last time, he'd been a washed-up actor at everyone's mercy.

Today, he was auditioning for the male lead in the blockbuster "Empress."

This would have been unimaginable before.

He knew his acting limitations all too well.

Not to mention his chronic camera fright.

After entering the studio, he excused himself to the restroom, asking Sophia to go ahead.

Ten minutes of mental preparation later, he finally mustered the courage to leave.

A shrill female voice cut through the hallway.

"If it isn't Mr. Valdemar! Finally come to pay your breach fee?"

It was Director Chen from "Fleeting Love," dressed in haute couture, her face twisted in mockery.

Adrian froze.

Had Sophia been too busy to handle this?

"Don't play dumb!" Chen sneered. "Did you really think you could get away with it? That legal notice from your company was laughable—"

Hearing this, Adrian actually relaxed.

With feigned interest, he asked, "Oh? What exactly did our legal team demand?"
###Chapter 279

"You want me to issue a public apology and declare the previous contract invalid?" Director Chen arched her eyebrows dramatically. "How absurd!"

Adrian Valdemar studied her twisted expression before chuckling.

"Indeed absurd."

The Valdemar Group's legal department had never lost a case since its establishment. He wondered what lawyer this washed-up director had hired to make such outrageous demands.

A faint smirk played on Adrian's lips, his striking features illuminated under the studio lights. Director Chen's eyes gleamed with undisguised lust as her gaze roamed over him.

"Actually..." She lowered her voice suggestively. "The compensation could be waived. If you'd just... keep me company for a while..."

Though well-preserved for her forties, the crow's feet around her eyes betrayed her age. Her attempt at coquettishness turned Adrian's stomach.

"Granny, is your house missing mirrors or toilets?"

His expression darkened. "At your age, you should spare people this secondhand embarrassment. Is your face made of reinforced concrete?"

The verbal dagger struck true. Director Chen's face purpled with rage. "You insignificant brat! Crushing you would be easier than squashing an ant!"

"Spare me!"

Adrian unleashed his full disdain. "You think you can sexually harass me? You only bully newcomers on set while groveling before investors. If your face could generate electricity, we could shut down every nuclear plant in the country!"

His notorious temper wasn't unfounded, but he never picked fights without cause.

"Tell me, are you hormonally imbalanced or just pathologically desperate?"

Director Chen trembled with fury. "You—you'll regret this! Not a penny less than two million! Don't come crawling back to me later!"

"Get psychiatric help."

Adrian turned on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Her shrill scream followed him: "Adrian Valdemar! You'll pay for this!"

Crew members exchanged bewildered looks as they passed by. Another meltdown from the director?

Adrian headed straight to the "Empress" set afterward. Director Chen's tantrum had unexpectedly eased his nerves.

After exchanging pleasantries with director Lucas Sheridan, he took his position before the camera.

Today's audition involved the Young Marquis' pivotal breakdown scene upon learning of his father's death—requiring seamless transitions from aristocratic charm to stunned disbelief, then utter devastation.

The challenging sequence had stumped every previous auditioning actor, leaving Lucas unsatisfied.
###Chapter 280

Adrian Valdemar had memorized every line of this scene.

Professor Eloise Fairchild had meticulously dissected the emotional journey of the Young Marquis for him.

During the first rehearsal, his performance was riddled with flaws.

After countless corrections from his mentor, he finally grasped the essence—only then did he dare accompany Sophia Laurent to the audition.

"Action."

At Lucas Sheridan's command, the set fell into complete silence.

All eyes locked onto Adrian.

Under the weight of their gazes, his body trembled imperceptibly.

He curled his lips into a roguish smirk, his voice dripping with languid amusement. "What's so glorious about military achievements? A life of wine and song is far more pleasurable."

His delivery was unexpectedly polished, capturing the essence of a spoiled nobleman with startling accuracy.

Were it not for the faint tremor in his limbs, it would have been flawless.

Just then, a servant from the Marquis's household rushed in. "Young Master, stop drinking—you must return home at once—"

The Young Marquis swirled his wine cup lazily. "Why the hurry? The night is still young."

The servant's face crumpled. "My lord... your father... he was stabbed by rebels outside the city walls. His body... has just been brought back to the manor."

The smile froze on the Young Marquis's face.

For several seconds, he stood motionless. His voice cracked. "What... did you say?"

His first instinct was disbelief—surely this was some cruel jest.

But he dismissed the thought instantly.

No servant would dare fabricate such news about the Marquis.

The Young Marquis staggered to his feet, knocking over his wine cup. He stumbled toward home, his movements unsteady.

As he turned, the playful glint in his eyes shattered into raw panic.

When he reached the manor gates, the sound of wailing from within rooted him to the spot.

After a prolonged silence, he pushed open the doors to his father's courtyard with trembling hands.

The sight of the Old Marquis's lifeless body engulfed him in tidal waves of grief.

The light in his bright eyes dimmed instantly.

A single tear traced down his cheek unnoticed.

The audition ended.

The set remained eerily quiet.

Lucas was the first to snap out of it.

He studied Adrian with a furrowed brow.

Sophia stood nearby, equally perplexed.

Both had noticed Adrian's trembling from the moment he stepped on set—a stark contrast to his flawless performance during last night's rehearsal.

Was it nerves?

The crew gradually regained their composure.

Their glances at Adrian carried pity.

His lines and expressions had been impeccable.

But the disjointed body language ruined it.

Lucas was notoriously exacting, and Richard Lowell's provocations had only intensified his demands.

Otherwise, the role of the Young Marquis wouldn't have remained uncast for so long.
###Chapter 281

Adrian Valdemar felt the weight of gazes piercing his back like needles, each pitying sigh a fresh sting.

His fists clenched so tightly his nails dug crescent moons into his palms.

Failure. Again.

The uncontrollable trembling before the cameras had shattered him once more.

This role was the opportunity he'd dreamed of—more precious than he'd ever imagined.

The lingering intensity of his performance left his eyes burning. He ducked his head swiftly.

"Let's talk in my lounge," Lucas Sheridan's voice cut through the silence.

Sophia Laurent murmured assent.

Adrian trailed behind them in silence, shoulders hunched like a chastened child.

Inside the lounge, Lucas wasted no time. "Adrian's performance today isn't at the Young Marquis's standard."

His gaze locked onto Sophia. "This project is critical for all of us. It must be flawless."

The unspoken implication hung heavy between them.

Sophia glanced at the boy biting his lip raw and sighed inwardly.

She knew how far he'd come. His delivery and expressions were perfect—if only his body would cooperate.

She'd promised no interference in casting when securing the investment.

Yet she couldn't let this chance slip away.

"However," Lucas continued, "if he fixes that one issue, I'll give him another audition. As a favor to you."

Sophia's eyes brightened.

"No." Adrian's voice scraped like sandpaper.

He'd heard enough hollow praise. Minor roles in "River Banquet" and "Empress" were beyond him—how could he hope for "The Long Ballad"'s third lead?

Another audition would only deepen the humiliation.

Sophia's palm smacked against the back of his head.

"Are you insane? Turning down this opportunity?" She turned to Lucas. "Thank you. We'll regroup and return."

Lucas nodded. "His acting's actually solid. Just needs to conquer that camera fear."

Once the director left, Sophia frowned. "What happened today?"
###Chapter 282

Just as Adrian was about to shout "one," rapid footsteps echoed outside the banquet hall.

Henry rushed to the second floor. "Boss! The Winstons are here!"

"What?"

Adrian's expression darkened instantly. He grabbed Sophia and shoved her toward Henry. "Take her away!"

"Yes, sir."

Henry dragged Sophia toward the back corridors.

"My shoes!"

Sophia's heels lay abandoned by the sofa.

Adrian kicked them under the couch with his foot.

There was no time to evacuate the first-floor crowd.

The Winston patriarch barged in with Isabella in tow.

"Ah—" Isabella screamed, covering her eyes.

The old man's face twisted in rage. "Clear the room!"

"Understood!"

Winston bodyguards sprang into action.

Guests scrambled for the exits. Women fled in every direction.

Lucas seized the chance to slip away with the crowd.

Outside, his men rushed forward anxiously. "Sir, what happened?"

"Minor issue." Lucas removed his mask. "Keep watching the Valdemars."

"Sir!" Another guard reported urgently. "Damian is inside too!"

"What?" Lucas kicked the man. "Why didn't you say so sooner?"

The guard cowered.

Lucas replaced his mask and vaulted back over the wall.

The banquet hall blazed with light.

Adrian descended the stairs calmly. "Mr. Winston, such an unexpected visit. No advance notice?"

"Notice?" The old man's cane struck the floor with a crack. "Notice for this depraved spectacle?"

"Standard business tactics." Adrian remained unruffled. "If it offends you, I'll cancel it."

Isabella flushed with anger. "Disgusting! Our family would never stoop to such methods."

"Different rules in Lorville."

"You—" Isabella suddenly remembered her purpose. "Where's Sophia? You brought her here—was this your plan all along? Hand her over!"
###Chapter 283

The cruel taunts were seared into Adrian Valdemar's memory like brands. Even after a decade, they remained as vivid as yesterday.

Every time he stood before the camera, those venomous words resurfaced on their own.

In the dressing room, Adrian took a deep breath in response to Sophia Laurent's inquiry.

"Never mind. The netizens are right. I'm not cut out for acting."

Damian Valdemar had always been his rival. When Adrian first entered the industry, he'd had plenty of fans.

When had the mockery begun?

Probably around the time Damian joined the entertainment world.

A weariness unbefitting his youth flickered in Adrian's eyes.

"I need a few days off."

Sophia studied his defeated expression, hesitating before speaking.

"Alright. Take some time to regroup."

Adrian's medical report showed no abnormalities.

The problem must be psychological.

This wasn't something to rush.

Sophia decided to investigate privately—perhaps consult Patriarch Valdemar for insight.

What exactly had this young heir endured?

Meanwhile...

Director Beatrice Holloway of the "Fleeting Love" production slunk back to her private lounge.

"Young Master Valdemar..."

Her obsequious smile was a far cry from her usual demeanor.

"That brat has no sense. I berated him for days, and he actually quit..."

"Can't you be more creative?" The voice on the phone dripped with disdain.

"Sleep with him, and I'll finance another series for you."

Beatrice's eyes lit up. "Really?"

Millions in funding, plus Adrian's striking looks...

"Don't worry. I'll find a way to secure him. I'll even send you the footage."

"Tch. I'll await good news." The call disconnected.

Beatrice's wrinkles smoothed with satisfaction.

She dialed Adrian's number.

"My tone was too harsh earlier. There's a cast dinner tonight—you should come."
###Chapter 284

Adrian Valdemar was at his lowest point.

He walked mechanically toward the studio exit.

His phone rang abruptly. He answered without checking the caller ID.

Director Chen's artificially sweetened voice came through.

Adrian's brow twitched almost imperceptibly.

What was this old woman scheming now?

Had she been plotting revenge since he humiliated her publicly?

The air around him turned icy.

Sophia Laurent immediately noticed the shift in his mood.

But the next second, Adrian suddenly laughed.

"Sure. Where?"

Hearing his agreement, Director Chen's face lit up with a smile.

"I'll book a private room right away. I'll text you the address later. You must come."

Her excitement was practically dripping through the phone.

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smirk, though his tone remained warm. "Count on it."

"Perfect! Tonight we'll talk things through. Let's put the past behind us. I promise to get you back on set."

A flash of mockery crossed Adrian's eyes. "How generous of you, Director Chen."

She hung up, thoroughly pleased, as if victory was already in her grasp.

What she didn't see was Adrian's terrifyingly dark expression.

Did she really think he was that naive?

Sophia frowned at the mention of "Director Chen."

"The director from Fleeting Love contacted you?"

Adrian shrugged. "Said it's a cast dinner."

Sophia grew more suspicious.

Why would they invite Adrian to a cast dinner?

The legal team had already sent a termination notice demanding a public apology.

This sudden invitation reeked of ulterior motives.

Sophia quickly assessed the possibilities: either they were surrendering—or setting a trap.

If it was the former, she wouldn't interfere with Adrian's decision.

But if it was the latter? As his guardian, she wouldn't stand by.

"Where's the dinner?"

Adrian shrugged again. "She didn't say yet."

"Forward me the address when you get it."

Adrian shot her a wary look. "Why?"

Sophia smiled innocently. "I'm free tonight. Might as well join the fun."

"Absolutely not." His refusal was instant.

This wasn't a social call.

He wasn't that helpless child anymore.

Sophia studied his unusual reaction and blinked. "You're not actually considering going back to that production, are you?"

Adrian scoffed. "I'd rather play a corpse than return to that dump."

Sophia stared.

"That's... quite the career aspiration."

When Adrian offered no further explanation, she didn't press.

She'd find out his whereabouts one way or another.

And she was just as curious about Director Chen's real intentions.
###Chapter 285

Night fell as city lights flickered to life.

Adrian Valdemar jolted awake from a chaotic dream, beads of sweat forming at his temples. He had dreamed of being trapped in that dark storage room again, surrounded by classmates' mocking laughter.

The sudden ringtone shattered the silence.

"Adrian, everyone's waiting. Where are you?" Director Chen's voice crackled through the receiver.

Adrian rubbed his temples. "On my way."

He hung up and checked the time. Outside, the city was already illuminated.

The private club was located in the suburbs. When Adrian pushed open the door, the private room buzzed with clinking glasses and boisterous chatter.

Nearly the entire "Love You Forever" cast had gathered.

"Adrian's here!" someone called out warmly.

Adrian paused. These fresh-faced actors' eyes held none of the calculation or flattery he was accustomed to.

"Sit here!" A ponytailed girl waved at him.

As Adrian moved to join her, Director Chen intercepted him.

"Adrian, we need to talk." The director slung an arm around his shoulders. "Sit by me."

Murmurs of agreement rose around them.

"Clear the air already."

"Director Chen means well."

Adrian's lips curled into a cold smile. He recognized that predatory gaze—a hunter eyeing trapped prey.

"Sure." He agreed readily.

Triumph flashed in Director Chen's eyes as he handed Adrian a glass of baijiu.

"My apologies. Let this drink make amends."

Adrian accepted the glass, fingertips tracing its rim.

Director Chen raised his orange juice. "Cheers."

His smile widened as he watched Adrian's untouched drink.
###Chapter 286

Director Chen tapped her fingers lightly against the glass, creating tiny ripples in the juice. Her smile froze when she noticed Adrian Valdemar's untouched drink.

"What's wrong, Young Master Valdemar? Not good enough for your refined palate?"

Adrian lazily lifted his gaze, toying with the silverware between his slender fingers. "At least you're self-aware."

Director Chen's meticulously drawn eyebrows knitted together. "What do you mean?"

"Exactly what I said." Adrian tugged carelessly at his collar, revealing the hint of a tattoo on his collarbone.

Director Chen slammed her hands on the table. "Adrian Valdemar, don't push your luck!"

Adrian suddenly laughed, though his eyes remained icy. "My luck is far too valuable for the likes of you."

His mood had already been foul before this ill-timed meeting. This clueless director had chosen the worst possible moment to provoke him. Forcing him to drink strong liquor upon arrival? Did she really think he was some pushover?

Director Chen abandoned all pretense, slamming her glass down. "Do you really think you're walking out of here unscathed?"

Adrian scoffed, sinking deeper into the leather sofa. "Who said anything about leaving?"

This was Valdemar territory. He was curious to see what tricks this woman had up her sleeve.

Director Chen trembled with rage. "Fine! Let's see how long that arrogance lasts..."

The rookie actors exchanged uneasy glances. Some began inching toward the exit.

"Director Chen, I just remembered I have an audition..."
"My agent needs me..."

Within moments, only Director Chen's inner circle and four burly men remained in the private room.

Adrian narrowed his eyes. "Going for the strong-arm approach, auntie?"

Director Chen traced the rim of her glass with blood-red nails. "You're too naive, Young Master Valdemar. You're drinking that liquor today."

Adrian discreetly pressed the service button, but no one responded.

His stomach dropped. Valdemar Hotels never had service lapses unless...

"Save your energy." Director Chen waved her phone triumphantly. "All staff on this floor received 'temporary reassignment' notices."

Adrian's knuckles whitened beneath the table, though his expression remained impassive.
###Chapter 287

Undercurrents

At age ten, Adrian Valdemar was discovered covered in bruises by his elder brother Alexander during a routine clothing change. The next morning, Patriarch Valdemar personally retrieved the boy to the family manor.

From that day forward, Adrian began daily combat training at dawn under the Valdemar security chief's supervision.

Director Chen drummed lacquered crimson nails against the tabletop, watching Adrian's expression darken with visible satisfaction.

"Did you think I'd invite you here unprepared?"

Her sharp clap summoned assistants and bodyguards. "Restrain him."

Adrian lunged for the private room's exit.

The hallway staff could provide witnesses if he just reached—

The door swung open to reveal unnatural stillness.

Every VIP room stood darkened. Even the service call buttons had been deactivated.

A security guard's uniform gleamed conspicuously near the elevators.

"Help! Kidnapping!" Adrian gasped, clutching the guard's sleeve. "I'm the second heir of Valdemar Holdings!"

The guard remained immobile.

Footsteps approached. Adrian shoved past only to be seized by vise-like grips.

His pupils contracted.

The betrayal stung deeper than expected—his own family's security turning against him.

"Our thanks," an assistant simpered. "This thief stole props from our production."

The guards handed Adrian over without hesitation.

When the door sealed shut again, Director Chen swirled her merlot with deliberate slowness.

"Must we resort to unpleasantness?" Her gaze traced his disheveled collar. "Such unnecessary defiance."

Adrian mentally cursed eighteen generations of Chen ancestors.

"Now Director," he suddenly beamed, "just a harmless prank."

Her eyes narrowed. "More tricks?"

"Wouldn't dream of it." He shrugged toward the liquor table, fingers brushing a crystal glass. "Not when even your security dances to your tune."

"Spill one drop," she hissed, "and you'll drink double."

Amber liquid caught the chandelier's glow as Adrian raised his glass.

"Such exquisite vintage..." His throat worked with each deliberate swallow. "Waste would be criminal."
###Chapter 288

Director Chen narrowed her eyes, her gaze locked onto Adrian Valdemar. She watched intently as he drained his glass in one gulp, only relaxing slightly when his shoulders finally slumped.

Adrian set down the empty glass. An unnatural flush crept up his cheeks.

He rubbed his temples, his eyes growing unfocused. His thick lashes cast shadows under the lighting, obscuring the calculating gleam that briefly flashed in his pupils.

With a dull thud, Adrian collapsed face-first onto the dining table.

Director Chen's lips curled in triumph. She gestured to her entourage. "Take him to room 1808."

Two burly bodyguards hauled the unconscious man toward the elevators.

The moment the door closed behind them, Director Chen pounced on the bed. Her trembling fingers traced the sharp angles of Adrian's jawline.

"Don't blame me for being ruthless. You brought this on yourself..."

She retrieved professional recording equipment from her designer bag, setting up the tripod with practiced ease.

"Cooperate nicely, and I'll make sure you get all the resources you need..."

As Director Chen undid her blouse buttons, Adrian's eyes snapped open.

In one fluid motion, he flipped their positions and pressed a pillow over her face. She thrashed violently, but years of gym training made Adrian immovable.

Within thirty seconds, he had her trussed up with torn bedsheets like a mummy.

Director Chen's muffled screams came out as incoherent whimpers.

Adrian straightened his cuffs with deliberate slowness, looking down at her with icy detachment. "Wondering why the drugs didn't work?"

He pulled out his phone with a smirk. "My grandfather was a master vintner. I grew up swimming in alcohol."

"As for your special cocktail..." Adrian chuckled darkly. "I switched our glasses when you checked your messages."

Director Chen turned deathly pale. She remembered Adrian excusing himself to grab napkins right then.

"Mmmph!" She writhed against her restraints.

Adrian arched an eyebrow. "Something to say?" At her frantic nodding, he yanked out the gag.

"You'll regret this!" Director Chen hissed. "I'll make sure you never work in this industry again!"

Adrian threw back his head and laughed. He leaned down until his lips brushed her ear. "Director Chen, who exactly holds the leverage here?"

Straightening up, he tapped his phone screen. The recording played back her earlier incriminating words. "Attempted sexual assault carries quite the sentence."
###Chapter 289

Director Chen didn't panic at his words. Instead, she smiled with confidence.

"What can you do? Do you have proof?"

Adrian pointed to the selfie stick in the corner. The recording phone's red light was blinking.

"Didn't you set this up yourself?"

Director Chen was momentarily speechless.

But her arrogance quickly returned.

"I suggest you let me go. The entire hotel is locked down. Security is everywhere. You can't escape."

She lowered her voice threateningly.

"You don't want to mess with the people behind me. Cooperate, and you'll suffer less."

That was the second young master of the Valdemar Group. How could a small-time actor like Adrian compete?

Both shared the surname Valdemar, but their statuses were worlds apart.

"Blame your bad luck."

Adrian understood everything in an instant.

From the moment he accepted the role in "Fleeting Love," he had fallen into Damian's trap.

Choosing a Valdemar-owned hotel was meant to lower his guard.

The mistreatment on set was all to distance Director Chen from Damian.

Adrian's expression darkened.

Though he hadn't drunk the spiked wine, he'd already finished a full glass of liquor.

If the entire hotel was under Damian's control, he truly had no way out.

He pulled out his phone. No signal.

"Don't waste your energy. The signal jammer's been on this whole time."

A flicker of despair crossed Adrian's eyes.

Since being adopted by Patriarch Valdemar, Damian had only dared to scheme in secret.

This was the first time he'd acted so brazenly.

Adrian couldn't help but worry about what would come next.

An eight-year-old Damian had been capable of terrible things. Now, his methods would be even crueler.

The video was likely just the beginning.

Seeing his silence, Director Chen pressed on.

"Relax, we don't want your life. Just cooperate."

She added,

"This kind of thing happens all the time in the industry. Your reputation's already ruined anyway..."

Adrian scoffed.

"Do you even know what kind of person Damian is?"

Director Chen's pupils constricted.

"Surprised?" Adrian stared at her. "We share the same surname. Didn't you ever wonder why?"

Her face turned deathly pale.

As Adrian searched for a way out, he continued coldly,

"Damian is the illegitimate son of a mistress. Understand now?"

Director Chen's legs gave out. She nearly collapsed to the floor.
###Chapter 290

"Are you also from the Valdemar family?" Director Chen's voice rose sharply, her fingers trembling uncontrollably. "The Valdemar Group that dominates the business world?"

Her teacup slipped from her grasp, leaving a dark stain on the carpet.

A mocking smirk twisted Adrian Valdemar's cold features. "That bastard Damian Valdemar dares to represent the Valdemars?"

"Impossible..." Director Chen staggered back two steps. "Vincent Valdemar's ex-wife only gave birth to Alexander..."

"Because people like you aren't worthy of knowing I exist." A shadow flickered in Adrian's eyes.

He loathed that surname.

Even more, he despised that hypocritical father.

Memories surged like a tidal wave—being cornered in the school restroom during middle school, just as Vincent happened to attend a parent-teacher conference. The man had merely cast him an indifferent glance before walking away.

"Why do they only bully you?" His father's voice still echoed in his ears.

Adrian clenched his fists. "How much time did Damian give you?"

Director Chen's face turned ashen. "Half... half an hour..."

Dusk deepened outside.

On the sixteenth floor, even the wind sounded piercing.

"Calm down!" Seeing Adrian move toward the window, Director Chen's voice cracked. "Damian is still your brother—"

"Brother?" Adrian suddenly laughed, his eyes bloodshot. "He'd grind my bones to dust if he could."

Meanwhile.

The hotel lobby glittered under crystal chandeliers.

Sophia Laurent strode through the revolving doors in stilettos, flanked by twelve black-suited bodyguards.

"Call your manager." She slammed her ID on the front desk.

The receptionist's hands shook so badly she could barely hold the phone upon seeing the embossed "Valdemar Group CEO" title.

In the penthouse suite, the aroma of tea swirled.

"Don't worry, Second Young Master," the manager fawned as he poured tea. "That guy won't escape."

Damian toyed with his phone, the screen displaying live footage from the sixteenth floor.

"If only my dear brother knew how helpful you're being..." He deliberately trailed off.

The manager instantly caught the hint. "It's an honor to assist the First Young Master."

On the monitor, Adrian's fist smashed into the wall.
###Chapter 291

Dark clouds gathered over Valdemar Holdings.

Alexander Valdemar lay comatose in the hospital while Vincent Valdemar and his illegitimate son circled like vultures. The corporate empire teetered on the brink of upheaval.

"Working for Young Master Damian is the greatest honor of my life."

The manager bowed so low his forehead nearly scraped the carpet. He didn't know who was locked in the private room—only that some D-list celebrity had foolishly offended the Valdemar heir.

Damian had orchestrated tonight's trap. Hearing the actress planned to sleep her way to fame, he'd commandeered their establishment. The manager considered this connection divine providence.

The front desk phone rang.

He silenced it with a scowl.

It rang again, insistent.

"Forgive the interruption, Young Master." The manager simpered. "A trivial matter requires my attention."

Damian waved a dismissive hand.

The manager backed out bowing, then whirled with a snarl. "Are you trying to get fired?"

"Sir," the receptionist stammered. "The CEO and Mr. Chamberlain just arrived..."

"What CEO?" The manager scoffed. "Alexander Valdemar's still hospitalized."

"It's... Madam Laurent."

The manager snorted. That figurehead interim CEO? The Valdemar empire would soon belong to Damian.

Still, appearances mattered.

"Understood." He hung up and pasted on another sycophantic smile. "Young Master, a minor issue downstairs..."

Damian didn't even glance up. "Get out."

The lobby gleamed under crystal chandeliers.

"Madam Laurent," the receptionist quavered. "The manager will be right down."

Sophia Laurent's fingers tapped the marble counter. "Search your registry for Beatrice Holloway."

The computer screen flickered. "No record under that name."

"Try these aliases."

Still nothing.

Sophia checked her watch. Adrian had only been inside twenty minutes—not enough time for even Damian's traps to spring. Yet her brow furrowed slightly.

The chandelier's light turned glacial in her eyes.
###Chapter 292

Warren Kingsley hurried out of the elevator.

His eyes immediately landed on Sophia Laurent standing in the hotel lobby. His lips curled in an involuntary sneer.

But when he noticed Henry Chamberlain beside her, he quickly plastered on a professional smile.

"Ms. Laurent, Mr. Chamberlain. I'm Warren Kingsley, the hotel manager."

Although the Valdemar brothers currently controlled the family empire, the Patriarch's appointed CEO still required surface-level respect.

Sophia instantly caught the disdain in his eyes. Her gaze turned glacial.

"Manager Kingsley, Adrian Valdemar is currently in this hotel. Pull up all surveillance footage immediately."

Warren's heart skipped a beat.

Adrian?

Alexander's younger brother?

Recalling Damian Valdemar's strange smile earlier, everything clicked into place. Cold sweat dampened his back.

"Mr. Valdemar's brother? But..."

He feigned concern with a frown. "It's late. A large-scale search would disturb our guests. If this gets leaked online..."

The unspoken implication: He wasn't refusing, just protecting the company's image.

Sophia smirked. "You're fired."

She had already notified other executives and security when summoning the manager.

Warren's smile froze. "On what grounds?"

"I've worked for Valdemar Holdings for twelve years! From waiter to manager. And you dismiss me with one sentence?"

His voice rose. "Who would remain loyal after such treatment?"

The threat hung thick in his words.

Henry's face darkened. "Watch your tone, Kingsley. Your termination paperwork is already processed."

Other hotel staff began arriving.

Murmurs spread at the news of Warren's dismissal. This was the former Patriarch's trusted man—someone even Alexander hadn't touched.

The assistant manager dared to ask, "Mr. Chamberlain, what's going on?"
###Chapter 293

Henry Chamberlain immediately recognized this man as the second-in-command at the hotel, just below Warren Kingsley.

"Sophia assigned him a task, yet he kept making excuses and dragging his feet. Such incompetence is unacceptable."

His gaze fleetingly swept over Sophia.

The assistant manager followed Henry's line of sight.

Standing not far from Henry was a woman with an icy demeanor.

Clad in a sharply tailored black dress, her every movement exuded efficiency and elegance. When she lifted her eyes, the authority they held was palpable—exactly as he'd seen in financial news segments.

But in person, she was even more striking, her presence more formidable.

The assistant manager's face instantly broke into an obsequious smile.

He sensed an opportunity.

"Madam Laurent, how may I be of service?"

While he assessed her, Sophia was studying him in return.

Compared to Warren, this man was much younger.

Though his smile was ingratiating, his eyes held clarity—none of Warren's calculating shrewdness.

Sophia gave a slight nod. "Adrian Valdemar has gone missing in this hotel. Mobilize all security personnel immediately and seal every exit."

The assistant manager's expression turned grave.

"Understood. I'll arrange it at once."

He swiftly summoned the head of security and his deputy to coordinate the search.

A large-scale operation would undoubtedly upset guests, but with proper handling and appropriate compensation, the fallout could be minimized.

Sophia observed coldly as the assistant manager issued crisp commands.

Orders were relayed, and everyone sprang into action.

Nearby, Warren watched through gritted teeth.

"Liam Delaney, do you realize what you're doing? This violates hotel protocol and will—"

He abruptly cut himself off.

Sophia arched a brow. "Will what?"

Warren scoffed. "You're just a temporary shield Patriarch Valdemar trotted out. Only an inexperienced fool like Liam would take you seriously. Who do you think you are, dictating terms in the Valdemar Group?"

He didn't believe Sophia would dare touch him.

With Vincent and Sebastian Valdemar backing him, what did he have to fear? Especially now that Alexander was comatose.

But Sophia's next words shattered his delusions.

Ignoring Warren entirely, she addressed Liam. "Effective immediately, you're replacing him. Once Adrian is found, begin the transition."

The assistant manager beamed. "Thank you for the promotion, Madam Laurent."

Warren's face darkened.

"Who the hell are you to demote me? Only the Valdemars can make that call! I'll never acknowledge an outsider's authority, and I sure as hell won't hand over anything!"

This upstart had been undermining him for ages. He'd die before surrendering his position.
###Chapter 294

Sophia Laurent's lips curled into a cold smile at his words.

"Being a hotel manager must have gone to your head. Whether you admit it or not means nothing to us."

Henry Chamberlain stood nearby, his expression darkening like storm clouds. "Warren Kingsley, you clearly don't understand the situation. Not just you—even your backer would have to grovel before our Madam."

Warren's face twisted with shock. "Nonsense!"

He was convinced Alexander Valdemar was finished—that Valdemar Holdings would soon fall into the hands of Vincent Valdemar and his sons. How could a mere figurehead like Sophia truly hold power?

Sophia and Henry exchanged a glance.

This man was definitely hiding something.

Adrian's disappearance was clearly orchestrated by someone.

They immediately turned and headed upstairs.

They had to find Adrian quickly—before it was too late.

In the presidential suite, Damian Valdemar set down his wineglass and checked his watch.

Beatrice Holloway had taken Adrian inside over twenty minutes ago.

The compromising footage should be ready by now.

It was time to bring the media in for the grand finale.

A cruel glint flashed in Damian's eyes.

He couldn't wait to see the old man's expression when Alexander remained comatose and Adrian was embroiled in scandal.

Beatrice's video was just the first step.

Now, he would lead reporters to broadcast Adrian's disgrace live.

Perhaps the shock would finish off that stubborn old man in the hospital once and for all.

The Valdemar empire rightfully belonged to his father.

Valdemar Holdings' future would only belong to him and Sebastian.

Damian led a horde of journalists straight to the sixteenth floor.

His bodyguards and Beatrice's assistant were already waiting outside the door.

"Everything ready?"

Damian twirled the keycard between his fingers, a vicious smirk playing on his lips.

Once Adrian's casting couch scandal went viral, that little bastard would never recover.

"All according to plan," the assistant and bodyguards chorused.

The hotel's soundproofing was excellent—they'd heard nothing.

Besides, Adrian had been drugged before being taken inside. What could possibly go wrong?

Inside the room, Adrian was desperately racking his brain for an escape plan when the electronic lock suddenly beeped.

Someone was coming in!

He sprang up from the bed.

"So soon?"

He hadn't figured a way out yet!

Fortunately, after subduing Director Beatrice, he'd immediately deadbolted the door.

Even with a keycard, no one could enter now.

Adrian exhaled slightly in relief.

"How many people did you arrange for this?"

Director Beatrice's face was ashen. "I don't know."

"You don't know?" Adrian scoffed. "Then let me tell you—there are probably reporters out there..."

His gaze swept over the half-dressed director. "Let's see how well you handle the spotlight."

Director Beatrice: "???"
###Chapter 295
The Trap

"Adrian, let me go."

Sophia struggled, her voice trembling with panic. If anyone captured this compromising scene, her reputation in the industry would be ruined.

"No." Adrian's grip remained ironclad. "If I release you, you'll just pounce on me again."

She bit her lower lip.

"Adrian, I genuinely want to help you."

He let out a cold laugh. "I'd sooner believe I'm the Jade Emperor."

The sudden whirring of a chainsaw erupted outside.

"Insane!"

Adrian's pupils constricted. He realized even if they were innocent, these intruders would force a scandal upon them.

Still no cell signal.

Frustration coiled through him as he clenched his fists. He should've informed Sophia before coming here.

The chainsaw's roar grew louder.

Adrian's gaze darted across the room before snatching up a toilet plunger, brandishing it toward the door.

The lock shattered under the assault.

"Adrian, what are you—"

Damian stood in the doorway, feigning shock, flanked by photographers with cameras at the ready.

"Even if Grandfather disapproves of you, this behavior is unacceptable."

A barrage of camera flashes illuminated the room.

Adrian smirked. "Ah, the bastard son finally shows himself."

"The Valdemars don't acknowledge trash like you."

Damian's face darkened.

"Quite the scandalous rendezvous." His smile turned venomous.

Only then did Sophia comprehend the trap, curling into herself with a shriek.

"Stop filming! Second Young Master, make them stop!"

Damian arched a brow in mockery.

"Director Sophia lives up to her notorious reputation."

Ice flooded her veins. She finally understood—she'd been disposable from the start.

"Young Master Valdemar, you can't do this—"

Slap!

A stinging blow whipped across her face.

"You tried to seduce Adrian yourself. What does that have to do with me?"

Damian's eyes gleamed with malice.

"Choose your next words carefully."
###Chapter 296

Damian Valdemar's lips curled into a cold smirk as his disdainful gaze swept across the room.

His personal media team stood behind him, tomorrow's scandalous headlines already drafted.

Director Chen clutched his stinging cheek in the corner, eyes burning with shock and humiliation.

Adrian Valdemar calmly pulled back the bedsheet, revealing his perfectly buttoned shirt.

"At least make your fabricated stories believable," he said icily. "Director Chen and I were reviewing scripts. Any problem with that?"

Damian let out a derisive laugh. "Script meetings require bedsheets now? Adrian, you're such a desperate D-lister, groveling for roles."

He waved dismissively at the reporters. "Get out after you've got your shots."

The room emptied quickly, leaving only Damian and his bodyguards.

The air turned glacial.

Adrian took a defensive step back. "What do you want?"

"Making you famous, of course." Damian snapped his fingers with a vicious grin. "Strip him. Let's get some... memorable footage."

Memories flooded Adrian's mind—

Ten years old, pinned in mud by Damian and his cronies, school uniform torn away.

Those mocking laughs still echoed in his ears.

His knuckles turned white from clenched fists.

Not this time.

The bodyguards advanced slowly, circling like predators toying with prey.

With the entire hotel under Damian's control, escape was impossible.

Tomorrow, the internet would explode with the Valdemar heir's compromising videos.

The Patriarch would disown him permanently.

Muscles tensed, Adrian prepared to fight like a cornered animal.

BANG!

The door burst open violently.

Damian's face darkened. "Who dares—"

"Quite the midnight party."

Sophia Laurent strode in, the hem of her black dress swaying with each click of her heels.

Her crimson lips curved as she surveyed the scene. "Ganging up on one person? How impressive, Young Master Valdemar."

Her crisp voice cut through the tense silence.
###Chapter 297

Adrian's pupils constricted violently.

Sophia's voice struck his muddled mind like lightning.

How did she find this place?

He had deliberately kept the gathering location secret.

A storm of questions erupted in his head.

Yet his tense nerves inexplicably relaxed.

With Sophia and Henry here, tonight's crisis was resolved.

Even if he doubted Sophia, he trusted Henry's capabilities completely.

This assistant who had served his brother for years always acted with ruthless efficiency.

"Adrian, are you alright?"

Henry approached swiftly, his brow furrowed.

But Adrian's gaze remained locked on Sophia.

Only when Henry spoke again did he snap out of it. "I'm fine."

Damian's expression shifted the moment he saw Henry.

The plan hadn't even begun. He forced composure.

"Mr. Chamberlain, barging in uninvited is rather rude, don't you think?"

His eyes lingered on Sophia with undisguised admiration.

"And who might this lady be?"

He hadn't been able to look away since she entered.

Only her tone displeased him.

Damian paid little attention to company affairs, merely hearing rumors about Alexander marrying some woman to take charge.

He'd scoffed at the idea.

With Adrian's failing health, how long could an outsider last?

Sophia regarded Damian coldly.

Before marrying into the Valdemar family, she'd thoroughly investigated their secrets.

Including Vincent's affair with Genevieve and the two illegitimate sons.

The eldest, Sebastian, was groomed as heir.

The younger stood before her now.

"Damian Valdemar, surrounding Adrian like this—are you testing legal boundaries?"

Being addressed so bluntly darkened Damian's face.

"Who do you think you are? Where's your proof I touched him?"

Sophia's lips curved slightly.

She walked to the selfie stick and removed the recording phone.

"The evidence is right here. Shall we let the police decide?"

Damian's heart lurched.

In the chaos, he'd forgotten about the recording.

He signaled his bodyguard. "Get that phone!"

The bodyguard lunged at Sophia.

Valdemar security reacted faster, instantly forming a protective circle.

Within moments, Damian's men were subdued and escorted out.

Watching the last bodyguard dragged away, Damian finally panicked.

He retreated two steps, blustering. "Do you know who I am? How dare you touch me!"
###Chapter 298

Sophia Laurent met Damian Valdemar's venomous gaze with an icy smirk.

"My name is Sophia Laurent." She paused deliberately. "As for you—you're nothing but a despicable creature who thrives in the shadows."

Her words struck back with precision, echoing the humiliation he'd tried to inflict earlier.

"Sophia Laurent?" Damian's brows furrowed.

He tilted his chin up arrogantly, sweeping her with a disdainful once-over.

Then he scoffed. "So you're that ghost bride Patriarch Valdemar arranged for Alexander..."

Before he could finish, the room plunged into silence.

Adrian Valdemar was the first to react. "You're dead!"

His fist flew toward Damian's face.

"Ah!" Damian howled in pain. "You bastard! How dare you hit me?"

His bodyguards moved to intervene, but Sophia's security team blocked them.

Seeing this, Adrian only struck harder, as if unleashing years of pent-up fury.

The pampered Damian was no match for him, reduced to spewing curses. "Motherless bastard! Insane little monster! Just wait until Father hears about this—you're finished..."

Adrian ignored the vitriol, raining blows down relentlessly.

Sophia listened, her frown deepening.

She'd investigated the Valdemar family dynamics.

Though she knew Alexander and Adrian's relationship with Vincent Valdemar was strained, witnessing it firsthand still shocked her.

For an illegitimate son to hurl such venom at the rightful heir spoke volumes about how unchecked Genevieve Roche and her son had been.

But the true blame lay with Vincent Valdemar, who'd allowed this toxicity to fester.

Adrian's practiced movements made it clear this wasn't the first time he'd been pushed to fight back.

Ten minutes later, Adrian finally stopped, chest heaving.

Damian had long since lost the energy to curse, reduced to glaring hatefully.

Raised in luxury, he'd always been the one tormenting Adrian.

This was the first time he'd been beaten into helplessness.

As Adrian released him, the reality of his impulsiveness sank in. He turned to Sophia anxiously.

"I'm sorry... I lost control..."

As a child, seeking help after being bullied had only earned him his mother's scolding.

From shock to disappointment, then utter despair—he'd learned to endure alone.

Adrian knew his very existence was a mistake.

No one had wanted him. No one would ever love him.

Now he'd recklessly attacked Damian, likely dragging Sophia into trouble.

His shoulders slumped in defeat.

Sophia arched a brow at his apology. "He tried to harm you first. Why are you apologizing?"

Her crisp tone made Adrian snap his head up. "You're... not angry?"

Sophia looked genuinely puzzled. "Why would I be?"

She'd heard Damian ordering his men to strip Adrian naked the moment she stepped through the door.
###Chapter 299

"He deliberately tried to ruin you and destroy your future. He deserved that beating."

Adrian Valdemar froze, his lips trembling slightly. "But..."

His fists clenched, voice hoarse. "Vincent Valdemar won't let this go..."

Sophia Laurent scoffed, icy glint flashing in her eyes. "What can he possibly do to me?"

Adrian's pupils constricted violently.

The word "father" weighed heavily in his heart. His mother's obsessive love for Vincent had filled him with both hatred and fear toward that man.

Yet Sophia's casual remark sliced through his inner darkness like a sharp blade.

"Don't waste your pain on trash."

Suddenly, Adrian found it easier to breathe.

The nightmares that had tormented him day and night dissipated at this moment.

Damian Valdemar always used Vincent to humiliate him, calling him bastard and mongrel.

But when he stopped caring about that so-called father, those venomous words lost their power.

Sophia noticed the teenager's reddened eyes and gently pressed his trembling shoulder. "You've suffered."

Tears instantly spilled from Adrian's eyes.

"Sophia!" Damian shrieked from the floor. "I'll ruin your reputation!"

Only then did Sophia spare him a glance.

"How was he planning to hurt you?" she asked Adrian.

"He arranged for Beatrice Holloway, that old hag..." Adrian's voice shook. "They were going to film it...then call reporters..."

Sophia's eyes turned glacial.

Not just destroying someone's innocence, but public humiliation—this was meant to utterly crush Adrian.

No wonder he'd been trembling so violently before the camera when she arrived.

For someone as young as Damian to be this vicious, someone must be pulling his strings.

Adrian's face turned deathly pale.

If Sophia hadn't come tonight, he didn't dare imagine what would have become of him.

A ruined reputation would have been the least of it—he might have gone insane.

"Let me go!" Damian kept shouting. "When my father and brother get here, you're all finished!"

Sophia suddenly smiled.

She turned to Adrian. "Want revenge?"

"Yes." Flames ignited in Adrian's eyes.

The years of abuse from Damian had already pushed him to the edge of a cliff.

Even after being taken away by Alexander, the darkness in his bones never faded.

Sophia stretched lazily. "I need some air. I'll be back in twenty minutes."

She led everyone out, including Damian's bodyguards.

Damian finally panicked.
###Chapter 300

Damian Valdemar watched helplessly as his bodyguards were dragged out of the room. His face turned deathly pale.

"You...you wouldn't dare touch me..."

His voice trembled as he met Sophia's icy gaze.

"Adrian is just a fatherless bastard. I'm the legitimate Valdemar heir..."

A mocking smile curled at Sophia's lips.

If Alexander weren't missing, Damian wouldn't dare act so arrogantly.

The manager of this five-star hotel wouldn't be fawning over him either.

Before leaving, she threw him a chilling remark. "Damian, do you know what karma is?"

"W-what do you mean?"

"The pit you dig for others will eventually become your own grave."

With that, Sophia strode out, instructing her guards to stand watch at the door.

Only Damian, Adrian, and the terrified Director Beatrice Holloway remained.

Cowering in the corner, Damian spat venomously, "Lay a finger on me and you'll regret it!"

Director Holloway swallowed hard. "A-Adrian, let's pretend this never happened. I won't demand the breach fee..."

She regretted everything. Had she known Adrian had such powerful backing, she'd never have targeted him.

Adrian's lips curled in disgust at their pathetic display.

He turned to leave.

Director Holloway exhaled in relief, thinking he'd spared them.

But minutes later, Adrian returned.

Two glasses of red wine glinted in his hands.

Director Holloway's pupils contracted.

It was the same "special cocktail" she'd prepared—a potent mix designed to lower inhibitions and cloud judgment.

"A-Adrian..." Her voice shook. "You're still half-brothers..."

Adrian scoffed.

"Brothers?"

His gaze turned razor-sharp. "When you drugged me, arranged the paparazzi, and tried stripping me—where was this brotherhood?"

"My only brothers are Alexander and Julian. What is this trash to me?"

Director Holloway fell silent.

Without ceremony, Adrian forced their jaws open and poured the wine down their throats.

Poetic justice.

Leaning against the wall, he waited.

Ten minutes later, the drugs took effect.

Director Holloway and Damian's eyes glazed over as they began tearing at their own clothes.

Adrian untied the director's restraints and exited.

Soon, obscene noises filled the room.

Adrian handed his phone to a guard.

"Go in. Get clear footage."
###Chapter 301

The bodyguard took the phone and pushed the door open.

A flash of white flickered through the gap.

Adrian Valdemar abruptly turned his face away, brows furrowed.

His eyes stung.

Ten minutes later, the bodyguard emerged and returned the phone.

"Young Master Adrian, the videos and photos are done."

Adrian checked the gallery and nodded in satisfaction.

He hurried downstairs, wanting to leave before Sophia Laurent arrived.

She shouldn't see this.

In the lobby, Sophia was reviewing financial reports.

The hotel's performance was unexpectedly strong.

The assistant manager whispered, "Warren Kingsley was trying to curry favor with Damian Valdemar for a promotion."

Sophia smirked coldly.

Footsteps echoed from the staircase.

"Sophia!"

Adrian's voice carried rare lightness.

She looked up at him.

Though his lip was bruised, his eyes were clear.

"Badly hurt?"

"Just a scratch." Adrian grinned, then winced in pain.

Sophia understood.

"Go home and tend to it."

Adrian obeyed. "Yes, Sophia."

She raised an eyebrow.

He used to say her name with sarcasm. Today, it sounded almost pleasant.

In the car, Adrian watched the scenery blur past.

For the first time in twenty years, he felt light.

The nightmares that had haunted him for years had finally faded.

At eight years old, Damian had filmed him naked in the mud and sent it to their entire class.

The classmates' stares had cut like knives, day after day, shredding his dignity.

Every night as an adult, the flashbulbs had flared in his dreams.

But last night, he'd slept deeply.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains, warming Adrian's face.

He opened the window and inhaled deeply.

The air smelled of freedom.
###Chapter 302

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows into the dining room. Sophia Laurent sipped her coffee slowly.

The shadow of Adrian Valdemar's failed audition still lingered. She had barely convinced Lucas Sheridan to grant a second chance, only for Adrian to refuse outright.

She massaged her temples. The role of the Young Marquis in "Empress" was tailor-made for Adrian. A perfect performance could not only redeem his tarnished reputation but also open new doors for his acting career.

Missing this opportunity meant losing a role of this caliber indefinitely.

"Morning, sis!"

A bright youthful voice interrupted her thoughts. Sophia looked up to see Adrian standing by the table. He wore a simple white shirt and light-wash jeans that accentuated his long legs. An uncharacteristically radiant smile graced his face, as if gilded by sunlight.

"Morning." She nodded slightly.

Adrian's smile widened, but he said nothing more, quietly taking the seat across from her. His appetite was unusually hearty today—he devoured two sandwiches.

Sophia studied him. The brooding, rebellious boy seemed transformed, brimming with vitality.

"Good news?" She set down her coffee cup.

Adrian froze momentarily. No one had ever inquired about his mood before. He chewed thoughtfully, eyes crinkling. "Damian Valdemar's in trouble."

Though the videos wouldn't be released yet, imagining his half-brother's distress was satisfaction enough.

Sophia caught the implication. "Did he bully you?"

Adrian paused mid-bite.

"You don't have to answer." She passed him a glass of milk.

"It's nothing secret." He set down his fork, expression calm. "He did harass me often."

"No one intervened?"

"Grandfather's health was fragile. I didn't want to burden him." Adrian peeked at Sophia's reaction. "As for Alexander... he had his own demons."

Alexander had been forced since childhood to master endless skills, just to earn their father's attention. Compared to his own suffering, his elder brother's psychological torment was equally brutal.

Sophia understood. She met Adrian's gaze squarely. "In the Valdemar household now, no one touches you."

Adrian's eyes sparkled like stars. "Sis! From today, you're my real sister!"

"That's unnecessary..." A flush crept up Sophia's neck at his sudden fervor. She quickly looked away.
###Chapter 303

A faint smile played on Adrian Valdemar's lips as he continued eating his breakfast.

Fifteen minutes later, he set down his utensils and suddenly looked up. "Sophia, can I audition for 'Empress' again today?"

After yesterday's incident, his fear of cameras seemed to have lessened.

With the lens no longer haunting him, he could finally pursue his dreams freely.

Sophia Laurent's grip on her coffee cup tightened. "But yesterday... you gave up."

Remembering Adrian's resigned expression still made her chest feel heavy.

It was like watching your own child abandon hope.

Adrian grinned. "I changed my mind. Could you talk to Director Sheridan for me?"

Ever since Sophia saved him yesterday, he'd fully accepted her as family.

He silently vowed to make sure his brother treated her right.

Unaware of her new devoted fan, Sophia nodded. "Alright, one more try."

"Thanks, Sophia."

＊

As they headed to the studio, the production team of "Love You Forever" suddenly released an apology statement.

@AdrianValdemar: Director Chen's health issues caused miscommunication. We sincerely apologize and eagerly await your return. All your requirements will be accommodated.

The statement immediately caused an uproar.

Adrian's anti-fans swarmed the comments.

Weren't they at each other's throats just days ago? What's this act about?

Must be some backdoor deal.

No way he'd last this long without connections. How does someone with his terrible acting keep getting roles?

Disgusting! The industry has no standards anymore!

The statement positioned Adrian against serious actors, fueling public outrage.

Meanwhile, Adrian stood on the "Empress" audition stage.

Director Lucas Sheridan's decision baffled everyone.

They'd all witnessed Adrian's disastrous performance yesterday.

While regrettable, the entire production couldn't be sacrificed for one actor.

The room fell silent as the audition began.

Same script.

Completely different Adrian.

His movements flowed naturally, expressions vivid, fully immersed in character.

When he finished, not a sound could be heard.

Standing center stage, Adrian's palms grew clammy.

He'd employed every technique Professor Fairchild taught him.

Why wasn't anyone saying anything?
###Chapter 304

The audition room fell into momentary silence.

Adrian Valdemar stood under the spotlight, his fingertips trembling slightly.

Suddenly, thunderous applause erupted.

"That's exactly the Young Marquis I envisioned!" Director Lucas Sheridan exclaimed, leaping to his feet.

The assistant director nodded vigorously. "The transition from playboy to hardened general was seamless."

"That face was sculpted by the gods," the stylist murmured in awe.

Adrian's gaze pierced through the crowd, locking onto Sophia Laurent standing in the corner.

She winked at him and flashed a victory sign.

Director Sheridan hurried over to Sophia.

"Where did you unearth this actor?" he whispered. "He's the living embodiment of this role."

Watching Adrian's flustered expression on stage, Sophia's lips curved upward unconsciously.

"Shall we sign the contract now?" she asked.

"Immediately!" Sheridan declared. "Have him report to the set tomorrow."

Meanwhile, social media exploded.

The official announcement of Adrian's casting in "Empress" instantly topped trending lists.

Comments flooded in:

"Dear god! The power of capital is terrifying!"
"Did Director Sheridan lose his mind?"
"Pearl Entertainment is determined to ruin 'Empress'!"
"Does Adrian's acting even deserve to share the screen with Scarlett?"

In the contract room, a pen glided smoothly across paper.

As Adrian set down the pen, his phone vibrated violently.

"How dare you lay hands on Damian?" Vincent Valdemar's voice dripped venom.

Adrian's eyes darkened, his knuckles whitening.

"He brought it upon himself," he sneered before ending the call.

On the other end, Vincent hurled his phone against the wall.

"That bastard has gone too far!" He turned to Damian lying on the hospital bed. "Your father will avenge this."

Damian stared blankly at the ceiling, his body still bearing repulsive marks.
###Chapter 305

The door burst open. Camera flashes flooded the room with blinding light.

Adrian Valdemar's face darkened instantly. He instinctively grabbed the sheets to cover himself. "Get out!" he roared.

The reporters ignored him. Their lenses focused relentlessly on the two figures in bed. Shutters clicked incessantly. The strobing flashes forced Adrian to squint.

"Do you have a death wish? The Valdemars will destroy you!" His voice cracked with hysteria.

The female director scrambled under the covers, only her terrified eyes visible. "Please stop..." she begged, trembling. "I'm begging you..."

Within thirty minutes, the scandal involving the Valdemar heir and the renowned director dominated every news platform. Trending lists exploded. Comment sections erupted in chaos.

Adrian fumbled into his clothes, his face ashen. He stormed out of the hotel while dialing his assistant. "Contact PR immediately. Suppress all coverage!"

At the Valdemar estate, Vincent Valdemar reviewed documents in his study. The butler rushed in. "Sir, there's an emergency!"

Vincent's fist slammed the desk when he saw the news. "That disgrace!"

Adrian staggered into the mansion and collapsed to his knees before his father. "Dad, I was set up!"

"Alexander and Sophia orchestrated this!" Tears streamed down his face. "They drugged me and filmed the whole thing to blackmail me..."

Veins bulged on Vincent's forehead. He snatched the landline and dialed Alexander's number. "You vile creature!"

The line went dead. Vincent trembled with rage, storming toward the door. "Prepare the car! I'm going to Serenity Villa!"

Adrian grabbed his arm. "Father, they still have the video..."

"I'll deal with Diana's precious son personally!" Vincent shook him off, eyes blazing.

At Serenity Villa, Diana Valdemar trimmed rose bushes. She didn't look up at the engine noise. "Bring me the shears."

Alexander hung up, his expression thunderous. He turned to Sophia. "I need to go back."

She handed him car keys. "Should I come?"

"No." He shook his head. "My mother's situation...is complicated."

After a pause, he added, "Take extra security when you go out. Vincent won't let this go."

Sophia smiled faintly. "Don't worry. I'm used to it."

Watching Alexander's retreating figure, she dialed Henry. "Arrange two teams of bodyguards. Twenty-four-hour rotation."

A respectful acknowledgment came through the line. Sophia gazed at the overcast sky through the window, her lips curling into a cold smirk.
###Chapter 306

Sophia Laurent watched Adrian Valdemar's furrowed brow, her fingertips lightly tapping the table.

"I'm coming with you."

The memories of Damian Valdemar's bullying were still vivid. Vincent Valdemar's arrival could only mean trouble.

A father's visit often signaled fresh wounds.

If confrontation was inevitable, it was better to face it sooner rather than later.

"No." Adrian reflexively refused.

That place wasn't for her.

"Sophia, focus on your work. I can handle this."

Her gaze remained steady. "You said the same thing yesterday."

She was referring to his solo meeting with Director Chen.

Adrian's ears tinged pink.

"It might get ugly..."

"It's fine." Sophia tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "What's meant to happen will happen."

As a Valdemar wife, she couldn't avoid these conflicts.

This showdown with Vincent was always destined.

Adrian hesitated.

"Then... let's go together."

Inside the car, Adrian spoke in a low voice, explaining the situation.

"Damian complained to Father. Now they're at Mother's place..."

His voice tightened. "I can't ignore this."

Sophia nodded slightly.

The ties of blood were impossible to sever.

Harsh shouts erupted from the Chinese-style garden.

"Diana Valdemar, how dare you encourage Adrian to hurt Damian?"

The sound of shattering porcelain followed.

"You came here for that woman's son?"

"What else?" Vincent sneered. "Did you think I'd come for you?"

A scream. Something heavy crashed to the ground.

"Get out! Now!"

"Look at you—disgusting!" Vincent roared. "Adrian's actions are your responsibility!"

Diana's hysterical sobs filled the air. "No explanations! Leave!"

When Adrian burst inside, he saw bodyguards restraining his mother as she clawed at Vincent.
###Chapter 307

Adrian Valdemar's breath caught the moment he stepped into the living room.

"Stop."

His voice cut through the chaos like a blade.

"Perfect timing, Adrian."

Vincent Valdemar turned with eyes sharp as knives.

"Hand over that video. Publicly apologize to Damian. Admit you framed him."

Adrian strode past him toward Diana Valdemar, who was being restrained by bodyguards.

"Mother, don't do this."

He gently pried the guards' hands away.

Diana broke free and began pounding her fists against Adrian's chest.

"Why? Why must I endure this?"

Adrian grunted in pain as his wounds throbbed.

Sophia Laurent gave a sharp glance. The bodyguards immediately pulled Diana away.

"Are you hurt?"

Sophia rushed to Adrian's side.

He shook his head, signaling for the housekeeper to take Diana upstairs.

Once his mother was gone, Adrian turned an icy gaze toward Vincent.

"Haven't you hurt her enough?"

Vincent sneered. "I wouldn't be here if you hadn't framed my son."

"Framed?" Adrian scoffed. "Your bastard inherited your treachery. He reaped what he sowed."

Vincent's hand shot up.

Sophia reacted instantly, yanking Adrian out of reach.

"You dare dodge me?" Vincent stumbled forward.

"Should he just stand there and take it?" Sophia positioned herself between them.

"I'm his father!"

"Father?" Sophia's laugh was bitter. "You don't deserve that title."

She pulled Adrian back as bodyguards formed a protective circle.

"Sentencing without evidence—is this your idea of justice?"

Vincent's face darkened. "Damian doesn't lie!"

"And Adrian does?" Sophia stood her ground.

"I raised him. I know him."

"You know him?" Sophia's voice dripped sarcasm. "You can't even see your own son clearly."

She met Vincent's glare. "No apologies. Not until we settle Damian's bullying of Adrian."

"Lies!" Vincent roared.

"The old man made a mistake marrying you! I'll make sure he knows the Valdemars don't need a shrew like you!"

He turned on his heel and stormed out.
###Chapter 308

Sophia Laurent's lips curled into a mocking smile as she observed Vincent Valdemar's pretentious expression.

Before she could speak, Adrian Valdemar cut in sharply.

"Bullshit!" Adrian's eyes blazed with fury. "Alexander and Sophia's marriage was arranged by the Patriarch. Who the hell are you to interfere?"

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

Since when were she and Alexander so devoted?

Vincent's face darkened. "I'm your father! Watch your tone!"

He glared at Adrian. "Alexander is my son. I decide his marriage!"

Sophia was impressive, but useless to him—just a thorn in his side.

Adrian scoffed. "You call yourself a father? Having you as a dad is a curse from our ancestors!"

Vincent trembled with rage, raising his hand to strike.

Despite his injuries, Adrian dodged effortlessly.

Vincent chased him fruitlessly, panting heavily.

"Adrian!" he snarled. "Issue a statement clearing Damian's name immediately, or I'll divorce your mother!"

Adrian smirked. "Like I care."

He'd be glad to see the miserable couple split.

But a flicker of concern crossed his eyes—his mother's obsession with Vincent was no secret.

Vincent noticed his hesitation and smirked triumphantly.

"And forget about your acting career. I’ll make sure you’re blacklisted."

Adrian's expression froze.

Though no longer in power, Vincent had deep connections after decades in the Valdemar family.

Sebastian Valdemar still controlled Valdemar Entertainment.

"Quite the show of authority," Sophia interjected coldly. "Since when did you own the entertainment industry?"

Vincent narrowed his eyes. "Acting is a disgrace. I’m doing him a favor."

His gaze slid to Sophia. "Or are you afraid he’ll outshine you?"

Sophia nearly laughed.

"No wonder the Patriarch handed the group to Alexander," she said smoothly.

Vincent exploded. "You—how dare you disrespect your elders!"

Sophia kept smiling. "Better than being a heartless snake."

Vincent grabbed a teacup, ready to hurl it.

"Margaret," Sophia said calmly, "note down any damages caused by Mr. Valdemar."

Vincent froze, cup midair, face flushing crimson.

"You’ll regret this!" he spat.

Sophia lifted her own teacup with grace. "We’ll be waiting."
###Chapter 309

The door slammed shut behind Vincent Valdemar with a thunderous crash.

Sophia Laurent watched his retreating figure with a sardonic smile curling her lips.

"Is that all you've got?"

She had expected more resistance from him.

The real puppet master pulling the strings was the woman who'd remained in the shadows all along.

Genevieve Roche—mother of Sebastian and Damian Valdemar.

A cold glint flashed in Sophia's eyes.

"Sis!" Adrian Valdemar bounded over, his eyes sparkling with excitement.

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

Adrian was practically vibrating with enthusiasm.

Diana Valdemar had always been outmatched in confrontations with her husband.

Each encounter reopened old wounds that left her devastated.

Today's outcome was unprecedented.

"You were absolutely brilliant!"

Sophia chuckled at his exaggerated admiration.

"Shall we check upstairs?" She gestured toward the second floor.

Adrian's expression sobered as he remembered their purpose.

"Will you come with me?"

Sophia's fingers stilled momentarily.

This would be her first meeting with Alexander's mother.

The timing wasn't ideal.

But leaving now would be even more improper.

"Let's go," she murmured softly.

In the second-floor bedroom, Diana slept peacefully.

The sedatives smoothed the lines of distress from her face.

Not yet fifty, she looked decades older from years of suffering.

Adrian sat by the bedside, his gaze troubled.

For as long as he could remember, his mother had vacillated between fragile stability and breakdowns.

During her lucid moments, she often held him while weeping silently.

Sophia observed quietly.

This society matriarch had imprisoned herself in a gilded cage of misery.

A ringing phone shattered the heavy silence.

Patriarch Valdemar summoned them for dinner.

"Let's go," Adrian whispered.

Stealing a glance at Sophia's expression, he suddenly thumped his chest in reassurance.

"Grandfather favors me and Alexander above all. Vincent's words mean nothing."

Sophia paused mid-step.

"Who said anything about divorce?"
###Chapter 310

Sophia Laurent blinked in confusion.

When had she ever expressed any concerns?

Though she thought this privately, she maintained her composure outwardly.

"My marriage with your brother is... complicated. Let's just let things unfold naturally."

To her, Alexander Valdemar was merely a means to an end.

Besides, with his status and position, how could she possibly make him an unwitting father?

"What do you mean 'naturally'? Marriage is a divine blessing! My brother would never dream of letting you down—"

Sophia's eyes widened. "???"

"Divine... blessing?"

She studied Adrian Valdemar skeptically.

Was this boy misunderstanding something?

Adrian smirked knowingly.

"Don't be shy, sister-in-law. I saw the Valdemar Group's press conference..."

Only then did Sophia recall that day.

To silence the media, she had spun a childhood sweethearts tale.

"..."

This misunderstanding had spiraled out of control!

"That was just PR talk. Don't take it seriously."

Adrian winked. "I get it, I get it. No need to explain."

Sophia: "..."

You get nothing.

Valdemar Sanatorium.

The Patriarch had prepared an elaborate lunch.

"Sophia, come sit."

Patriarch Valdemar beckoned warmly. "You've been working hard lately."

Sophia took her seat gracefully.

Adrian grumbled beside her. "Old man, aren't I your actual grandson?"

The Patriarch didn't even glance up. "Leave if you're not eating."

Adrian: "..."

"This is blatant favoritism!"

Ignoring him, the Patriarch turned to Sophia.

"Sophia, thank you for looking after this troublemaker."

Had Henry Chamberlain not reported it, he wouldn't have known how long Adrian had been mistreated.

The thought filled him with both heartache and guilt.

Damian Valdemar had been corrupted from childhood.

And the most despicable one was Vincent Valdemar.

Without his backing, who would dare target Adrian?

Sophia paused mid-bite. "It was nothing, Grandfather. No need to dwell on it."

To her, it was just a small favor.

But for Adrian, it was a turning point in his life.

The drama "Empress" might just be his chance at redemption.
###Chapter 311

The wilderness. The Celestial Sword Sect.

At the foot of the Celestial Sword Peak, the crowd stirred.

"Isn't that Su Zheng? The traitor who was supposed to die in the Outer Battlefield six years ago!"

"Shh, keep your voice down. He was the top genius of the Northwest back then, reaching the Half-Step Divine Demon Realm at sixteen."

"What does genius matter? He colluded with the otherworldly races and got nine Divine Demon Elders killed. Even his fiancée testified against him."

Amid the whispers, a ragged young man walked forward slowly. His body was covered in wounds, his clothes stained with blood, yet his back remained straight, his gaze sharp as a blade.

This was Su Zheng.

Once the prodigy who dominated the Northwest, now stripped of all his cultivation. Yet he had stubbornly returned to the place that betrayed him.

Inside the grand hall, the atmosphere was tense.

"Elder Luo, Bi Zhu and I are deeply in love. I hope you'll grant us your blessing." Chu Feng held a gilded betrothal letter, his smile confident.

Luo Quan frowned. "But Bi Zhu's engagement to Su Zheng—"

"Su Zheng has been dead for six years. The engagement is void." Chu Feng interrupted. "Besides, my Flame Cauldron Sect has two spots at the Primordial Academy. If Bi Zhu marries me, she can attend with me."

Qing Yi snorted and turned to leave, only to freeze at the entrance.

"Brother?"

Her shocked cry silenced the entire hall.

Chi Bi Zhu's pupils constricted, her fingers trembling uncontrollably. She had personally pushed Su Zheng into the abyss. How could he still be alive?

Su Zheng stepped inside, his gaze like a honed blade.

"Surprised?" He stared at Chi Bi Zhu. "When you stole my Divine Demon Marrow Elixir, did you ever imagine this day?"

"Su Zheng!" Luo Quan slammed the table and stood. "How dare you show your face here?"

"Why wouldn't I dare?" Su Zheng smirked coldly. "I wasn't the traitor. You were!"

Chi Bi Zhu forced herself to remain composed. "You colluded with the otherworldly races and got nine elders killed. I saw it with my own eyes!"

"What a convincing eyewitness account." Su Zheng's eyes glinted with frost. "Outside the Heavenly Gate, who was it that stabbed me in the back?"

Luo Quan roared, "Enough! The evidence is irrefutable, yet you still deny it?"

"Evidence?" Su Zheng scoffed. "Based solely on her word?"

A crushing pressure descended like a mountain, yet Su Zheng didn't flinch. He met Luo Quan's gaze head-on.

"Grandfather plucked you from the snow. Father treated you like a brother. And this is how you repay them?"

The hall fell deathly silent.

Su Zheng spoke slowly, each word deliberate.

"Today, I've returned to demand justice."
###Chapter 312

Sophia Laurent's lips twitched slightly at Adrian Valdemar's attempt to comfort her.

She truly wasn't upset. Visiting Alexander Valdemar was merely a formality.

"I'm really fine."

She settled into the chair beside the hospital bed, propping her chin on one hand as her gaze lingered on Alexander.

Valdemar Holdings' operations had stabilized.

A few more major deals, and she could gracefully step back, returning control to Patriarch Valdemar.

If Alexander never woke, the family would have to choose another heir.

She'd done all she could.

Adrian frowned at Sophia's distant expression.

He shot Alexander a glare but held his tongue.

Ten minutes later, Sophia rose.

"Adrian, I'm going to check on Aunt Margaret. Wait here."

He nodded. "Of course, sis. I'll stay with my brother. Call me when you're ready to leave."

"Alright."

The moment Sophia left, Adrian exhaled in relief.

Once certain she'd exited the floor, he lowered his voice.

"Bro, how long are you planning to keep faking this coma?"

Alexander's eyes opened. "Problem?"

"No."

Adrian raked a hand through his hair irritably. "I just don't get why you're hiding it from Sophia. You enjoy watching her suffer?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Did she cry?"

"Not exactly." Adrian scoffed. "But she's clearly unhappy."

Silence.

Alexander hadn't meant to deceive her.

They were practically strangers, and with his injuries still healing—he could barely stand—he didn't know how to face her.

When Alexander remained quiet, Adrian continued unprompted. "She's a good woman. Don't screw this up."

Alexander's icy glare cut through him. "Out."

Adrian snorted. "Fine. Like anyone besides Sophia wants to visit you anyway."

The door slammed behind him.

Alexander massaged his temples.

He reached for his phone, scanning the documents Henry Chamberlain had sent.

During his "coma," Vincent Valdemar and Genevieve Roche's collaborators had revealed their hands.

Some demanded exorbitant prices. Others imposed impossible terms.

All applications bore Vincent's associates' signatures.

Perfect for rooting them out.

Legitimate projects were quietly funneled to Sophia through Henry.

One month, max. Then the trap would spring shut.
###Chapter 313

Sophia Laurent left Alexander Valdemar's hospital room and went straight to the building where Margaret Delaney was staying.

She first consulted the attending physician.

"The patient has shown frequent brainwave activity recently, with clear signs of awakening," the doctor said, flipping through the medical records.

Sophia's eyes lit up.

During her time at the Lowell family estate, Margaret had given her the maternal love she had been missing.

She remembered when she first got her period—Margaret had patiently taught her how to use sanitary pads.

"Aunt Margaret, Sophia is about to start her internship," Sophia murmured softly by the bedside.

She held Margaret's wrinkled hand.

"The company is hosting a design competition, and Sophia will participate," she continued gently. "If you wake up, you can go see her in person."

The figure on the bed suddenly twitched a finger.

Sophia was talking about Sophia's design talent when she felt a tug on her sleeve.

She looked down to see Margaret gripping the fabric of her shirt.

"Aunt Margaret!" Sophia gasped.

The woman on the bed slowly opened her eyes.

Sophia reached for the call button in excitement, but Margaret stopped her.

Margaret's lips trembled as if she wanted to speak.

"Don't rush. Take your time," Sophia leaned in closer.

The room was so quiet the sound of the IV drip could be heard.

"It... was... a scheme..." Margaret's voice was barely audible. "The switch... was intentional..."

Sophia's pupils constricted.

"You mean, my being switched at birth was planned?"

Margaret nodded weakly.

The motion drained the last of her strength.

Sophia's expression turned icy in an instant.

If this was true, then Emily Lowell and her family were the masterminds.

"Your adoptive mother's... sister..." Margaret spoke haltingly. "She used to... work as a maid... for the Lowells..."

The words struck Sophia like a bolt of lightning.
###Chapter 314

Margaret's trembling lips parted slightly. Sophia caught several key words.

"You mean...Emily's biological aunt?"

The elderly woman on the hospital bed nodded weakly, a glimmer of relief flashing in her clouded eyes.

Sophia clenched her fists, nails digging into her palms.

"So it was a premeditated switch all those years ago?"

Margaret's breathing grew labored, her skeletal fingers twitching.

Sophia immediately pressed the call button.

"Don't exert yourself. I'll get the doctor."

In the hallway, Sophia leaned against the cold wall as fragmented memories flooded her mind.

Adrian found her staring blankly out the window.

"Sophia?"

He'd approached quietly but froze when he saw her expression.

The icy glint hadn't faded from Sophia's eyes when she turned.

"Find someone," she said tersely. "Emily's maternal aunt."

Adrian understood instantly, pulling out his phone to make a call.

During the car ride home, Sophia's phone lit up.

"Sophia dear..."

Victoria's voice dripped with uncharacteristic sweetness.

"Come home for dinner tomorrow? I'll cook personally."

A cold smile curled Sophia's lips.

"Sure."

Her immediate agreement seemed to startle the woman on the other end.

"What...what would you like to eat?"

"Leftovers will do," Sophia said lightly. "I often had nothing to eat as a child."

A sharp intake of breath came through the phone.

Hanging up, Sophia watched the scenery blur past the car window.

Tomorrow's dinner would be interesting. She couldn't wait to see what new performance the Lowells had prepared.
###Chapter 315

The line went dead with a sharp beep. Sophia Laurent hung up decisively.

Victoria Lowell's hand trembled slightly as she clutched the phone.

Her earlier joy evaporated instantly, replaced by a suffocating tightness in her chest.

Richard Lowell leaned in eagerly. "Did she agree?"

Lowell Entertainment had been struggling recently.

"River Banquet" had become their last lifeline.

If this film succeeded, the company might survive.

William Lowell had pulled all-nighters for a week straight, handling endless crises.

Daniel Lowell moved near the office to focus on the Starlight Design Awards.

Nathan Lowell spiraled into self-destruction, drowning himself in alcohol daily.

The once brilliant musician now refused to leave his room.

Christopher Lowell remained in detention with no release date.

The Lowell family had crumbled in just one month.

Only then did Richard realize Sophia's true worth.

Ever since she married into the Valdemar family, he'd tried to reconcile.

But Sophia never gave him the chance.

Tonight's dinner finally offered hope.

Her return could save them all.

News spread quickly through the Lowell household.

William exhaled in relief at his office, his reprimands to subordinates softening.

Daniel kept his head down, absorbed in design sketches.

Nathan set down his glass, his expression conflicted.

His career didn't have to end this way.

Creative blocks could be overcome. Fans could be won back.

Yet he remained trapped in self-loathing.

The news of Sophia's return stirred something within him.

Emily Lowell clenched her fists.

Her nails dug deep into her palms.

Sophia wasn't the same pushover anymore.

With Pearl Group and the Valdemars backing her...

Emily regretted stepping aside.

Had she known this would happen, she'd never have let Sophia marry Alexander.

Still...

A cold smirk twisted her lips.

That video remained her trump card.

Once obtained, the Valdemars would discard damaged goods.

Pity those greedy gangsters kept delaying delivery.
###Chapter 316

A sinister glint flashed in Emily Lowell's eyes.

If the Lowells had disposed of Sophia Laurent earlier, she wouldn't have been reduced to this state.

As the sole heiress of the Lowell family, she should have been living carefree.

Time was running out. She needed to act fast.

With the Lowell family's decline, she had to secure her own future.

Her phone rang, interrupting her thoughts.

"Emily, care to join me for dinner tonight?"

The man's warm voice instantly smoothed her furrowed brows. A sweet smile curved her lips.

"I finished filming early today..."

"Was the shoot exhausting?"

"Not too bad." Her voice softened. "Just these period costumes are so heavy..."

"Give me half an hour."

After hanging up, the tips of Emily's ears turned pink.

Richard Lowell had always been profit-driven. If not for her beauty, elite education, impeccable socialite reputation, and Ryan Cunningham's relentless six-month pursuit, she would have been the one married to that vegetative Alexander Valdemar.

The old fox wanted both the Valdemar and Cunningham alliances. That's why Sophia became the sacrificial lamb.

Ryan's courtship had become her lifeline.

Though furious about Derek Langley parachuting into Lowell Entertainment, Richard had to swallow his pride for the Cunninghams' sake.

Marrying into the Cunningham family would secure her future.

What touched her most was Ryan's unwavering affection despite knowing the shadows in her past.

Emily chose a pearl-white mermaid gown with understated elegance. A million-dollar diamond necklace sparkled at her collarbone, enhancing her ethereal beauty.

At the staircase landing, she encountered Richard.

"Going out so late?"

"Ryan invited me to dinner." She lowered her eyes demurely.

Richard's face brightened. "Shall I arrange a car?"

"He's picking me up personally."

Watching his daughter's bashful expression, Richard smiled wider. "Be safe."

As Emily left, Victoria Lowell emerged from the shadows.

"Finally..." She exhaled in relief.

"What's wrong?"

Victoria hesitated.

Those leaked photos of Emily getting cozy with her four adoptive brothers still haunted her.

For six months, Emily had played hard to get with Ryan.

Everything changed when Alexander fell into a coma after the accident.

Richard seized the chance to pawn Sophia off to the Valdemars while reserving the Cunninghams for Emily.

Victoria's greatest fear was a scandal between her adopted daughter and four sons.
###Chapter 317

Emily Lowell finally got the frequent dates she'd been waiting for with Ryan Cunningham. Her anxious heart could finally settle.

Inside the upscale French restaurant, crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow. Emily sat poised across from Ryan, the sound of a violin drifting through the air.

Ryan reached into his suit jacket and produced a velvet jewelry box, sliding it toward her alongside ninety-nine champagne roses. "Mimi, I picked this especially for you."

Her fingers trembled slightly as she accepted the gift, her pulse racing. "Thank you."

Inside lay a rare pink diamond bracelet—the very one that had been snapped up by a mysterious bidder at last week's auction. She fastened it carefully, the gems shimmering under the light.

"It's beautiful," she murmured, turning her wrist to admire it, eyes alight with delight.

Ryan's lips curved. "Worth every minute in line if it makes you happy."

The thought of him queuing for her sent warmth through her chest. "You always put so much thought into everything."

He sliced his foie gras with deliberate grace, gaze intent. "For you? Anything."

The suggestive words made her ears burn. Throughout dinner, their conversation flowed effortlessly, each exchange laced with playful teasing and unspoken tension.

As they left the restaurant, Ryan draped her coat over her shoulders. "Let me take you home."

Emily bit her lip, reluctant for the night to end. But she nodded with practiced restraint.

Inside the limousine, neon lights flickered past the windows. The enclosed space carried the mingled scents of sandalwood and faint cigar smoke, making her heartbeat quicken.

A quiet sigh escaped him.

"What's wrong?" She turned sharply.

Ryan shook his head. "Nothing."

"Don't lie to me."

"I'd planned to introduce you to my family next week." He smiled ruefully. "But there's an issue with our medical robotics project in Switzerland. I need to handle it personally."

Her eyes brightened before dimming again. "Work comes first. We can reschedule."

"I wanted to make things official sooner." He rubbed his temple. "The project's stuck on the core algorithm. If only we could get Professor Smith on board."

"Professor Smith?"

"The leading authority in AI medical applications." Ryan launched into an animated explanation of the man's achievements before catching himself. "Sorry. I shouldn't bore you with technical details."

He shifted topics smoothly. "When are you free? My parents have been asking to meet you."
###Chapter 318

Ryan Cunningham's arm encircled Emily Lowell's slender waist, pulling her closer.

Emily nestled against his chest without hesitation.

Her pulse quickened when he mentioned taking her to meet his family.

"Really...you want me to meet your parents?"

"Of course." Ryan's voice softened. "You're extraordinary. I need to make you mine before someone else does."

The words sent a thrill through her.

"Stop..."

She smiled, but her mind drifted to the name he'd mentioned earlier—Preston Quincy.

The lead scientist of Lowell Group's medical robotics project shared that name.

The classified nature of the project meant few knew its details. She'd only overheard William discussing it in his study.

If even the Cunninghams valued this scientist, the project must be more significant than she'd realized.

They continued their affectionate banter, both carefully avoiding further mention of Preston Quincy.

Ryan escorted Emily to the Lowell estate gates.

"Today was rushed. I'll visit properly next time."

Emily nodded shyly. "I'll be waiting."

They lingered at the entrance, reluctant to part. Only after several moments did Emily finally step inside.

Ryan watched her go, his smile vanishing the instant the door closed.

"Sir, can we trust the second Lowell daughter?" the chauffeur asked.

Ice crept into Ryan's eyes. "She's manipulated all four Lowell brothers. She's our best avenue to Preston Quincy."

He paused. "Even if we can't secure the technology, the intelligence alone is worth it."

This project was the key to surpassing the Valdemars.

"Prepare the proposal venue," he ordered coldly.

The chauffeur immediately complied.

Emily returned to the silent Lowell mansion.

After showering, she slipped into a black silk nightgown and entered William's bedroom with practiced ease.

Meanwhile, William received news that Sophia Laurent would return tomorrow.

He abandoned his paperwork and headed home early.

Anticipation warmed his chest at the thought of seeing her.

But when he pushed open his bedroom door, he found Emily lounging in his bed.
###Chapter 319

William Lowell pushed open the door to find Emily curled up on the couch watching TV.

"Big brother!" Emily's eyes lit up as she sprang from the sofa.

She wore pink loungewear, her damp hair dripping water droplets from a recent shower.

William's Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he averted his gaze.

"You're home so late?" Emily took his briefcase, her fingertips brushing his knuckles.

His body stiffened. "Had a project deadline."

"It's ten o'clock!" She frowned. "You'll ruin your health like this."

Rising on tiptoes to check his temperature, she found him deftly avoiding her touch.

"I'm fine." His smile looked strained.

Emily bit her lip and suddenly grabbed his sleeve.

"Let me help at the company."

William blinked. "You?"

"I know I'm not as capable as Sophia," her lashes lowered, "but I could handle minor tasks."

"No." His refusal came sharp as a blade. "It's too demanding."

Emily's eyes instantly glistened.

"You think I'm incompetent..."

She turned to leave when William caught her wrist.

"Emily..."

"Then why was Sophia allowed?" Tears pooled in her upturned eyes. "I can learn too."

William's heart clenched.

Finally he sighed. "Fine. Start as an assistant."

"Really?" Her tears transformed into a radiant smile. "Can I use Sophia's old office?"

After a hesitation, he nodded.

Emily squealed and threw herself against him.

The soft warmth of her body pressed close, her shampoo's floral scent enveloping him.

William shoved her away abruptly.

"I need a shower." He practically fled.

Under the cold spray, William slammed a fist against the tiles.

How could he entertain such thoughts about his sister?

Outside, Emily traced where he'd touched her, lips curving in a knowing smile.

When William emerged, the living room stood empty.

Only the lingering warmth on the couch proved it hadn't been a dream.
###Chapter 320

Twilight descended as the Lowell mansion blazed with light.

Sophia Laurent stepped into the grand hall, her stilettos clicking against marble. The crystal chandelier cast dazzling prisms across her path.

"Sophia!" Richard Lowell hurried forward, his face creased with practiced warmth. "Our Michelin chef prepared bluefin tuna and foie gras with black truffles."

William Lowell pulled out a chair with exaggerated courtesy. "Sit here, sister."

Emily Lowell offered a napkin with trembling hands. "For your hands, sister."

Sophia observed this charade of familial harmony with icy detachment.

A decade ago when she'd first been brought to this house, they'd barely spared her a glance.

Now that she held the reins of Pearl Group, they'd suddenly learned to act.

An expensive Bordeaux gleamed on the table. Sophia lifted the glass, taking a measured sip.

"Sophia, about the biomedical project..." Richard ventured cautiously.

"Has Dr. Quincy made progress with the gene-editing technology?" Her fingers tapped the tabletop.

The Lowells' eyes lit up.

"Yes! Exactly! We've been waiting for your leadership."

Emily's eyes suddenly welled with tears. "Sister, it's all my fault..."

William immediately chimed in. "Emily was also a victim in the baby-switching incident."

Sophia set down her fork.

The metallic clatter silenced the table.

"Do I hate you?" Sophia locked eyes with Emily. "You're not even worth that."

Emily's face drained of color.

Her gaze instinctively sought Nathan Lowell, only to find him meticulously cutting his steak.

He didn't even look up.

Emily's nails dug into her palms.

Her once-protective fourth brother now couldn't be bothered to spare her a glance.
###Chapter 321

Morning sunlight filtered through the sheer curtains into the bedroom.

Little Fubao rubbed her sleepy eyes and sat up, her fluffy curls sticking out in every direction.

"Fubao's awake?" Uncle Number One pushed open the door with a steaming glass of milk.

Uncle Number Two followed closely behind, holding two brand-new dresses. "Pink or blue today?"

Uncle Number Three peeked in from the hallway. "I made your favorite strawberry pancakes."

Fubao blinked her big eyes and said in her sweet baby voice, "I want both~"

Uncle Number Four squeezed in with a plush toy. "Look what I got you!"

Uncle Number Five held up flash cards. "Time to learn new words today."

Uncle Number Six waved a tiny comb. "Let me braid your hair."

Uncle Number Seven carried a fruit platter. "Have some fruit first."

Uncle Number Eight raised his camera. "Make way! I need to take Fubao's picture."

The little girl found herself surrounded by eight doting uncles, her face lighting up with joy.

She pointed her chubby fingers at each uncle in turn. "First Uncle hug, Second Uncle kiss, Third Uncle feed..."

The grown men scrambled to fulfill their princess's every wish.

Grandma's voice boomed from downstairs. "Come eat breakfast! Stop spoiling that child!"

All eight uncles instinctively ducked their heads.

Fubao covered her mouth and giggled, her eyes crinkling like crescent moons. "Uncles got scolded again~"

She bounced toward the stairs, making all eight men chase after her. "Slow down! Don't fall!"

In the dining room, Grandma pretended to frown while secretly slipping the largest fried egg onto Fubao's plate.

"Thank you, Grandma~" the little girl chirped.

The uncles watched with puppy-dog eyes. "Mom, where's ours?"

Grandma glared. "Don't you have hands?"

Fubao's laughter filled the morning with warmth and joy.

The aroma of the Forgetfulness Elixir drifted across the Naihe Bridge.

Little three-year-old Fubao stood on tiptoes, peering curiously.

"Granny, does this soup really make people forget everything?"

The Soul Ferrywoman didn't look up, mechanically ladling the brew.

"Drink it and you'll be reborn."

Fubao tilted her head, suddenly extending her chubby little hand.

"Granny, I want to taste it."

The ladle froze mid-air.

"Nonsense!"

Finally raising her head, the Soul Ferrywoman revealed a face far too youthful for her title.

Fubao's eyes widened in surprise.

"Granny, you're so pretty!"

A faint blush colored the Soul Ferrywoman's cheeks as she turned away.

"Stop flattering me."

Yet her ladle secretly scooped an extra half-spoonful of sugar.

Fubao's sharp eyes caught the gesture.

"Granny's actually really kind."

The ladle trembled slightly.

"Keep talking and you won't get any."

Fubao obediently closed her mouth, but a secret smile played on her lips.

Footsteps approached in the distance.

The Soul Ferrywoman's expression changed as she quickly hid Fubao behind her.

"Stay quiet."

The Black Wraith appeared at the bridge's edge.

"Why hasn't today's batch been delivered?"

Her voice turned icy.

"It's ready now."

She discreetly slipped a candy into Fubao's palm.

Clutching the sweet, Fubao's eyes sparkled.

So even the Soul Ferrywoman kept secret candies!

This discovery delighted her beyond measure.

The Black Wraith sniffed suspiciously.

"I smell living flesh."

Her face remained impassive.

"Your nose is faulty."

She slammed the bowl onto the tray.

"Take it and go."

His anger flared.

"Watch your tone!"

A cold smile curved her lips.

"This is my tone. Take it or leave it."

Hidden behind, Fubao nervously twisted her sleeve.

The Black Wraith suddenly grabbed the Soul Ferrywoman's arm.

"What are you hiding?"

A candy tumbled to the ground.

Dead silence fell.

Fubao's heart leaped to her throat.

Bending gracefully, the Soul Ferrywoman picked up the sweet and slowly unwrapped it.

Under the Black Wraith's stunned gaze, she popped it into her mouth.

"Got a problem with my candy?"

The Black Wraith's face darkened with rage.

"You...how dare—"

She waved dismissively.

"Scram."

Fubao covered her mouth, barely suppressing giggles.

The Soul Ferrywoman was amazing!

With a furious swirl of robes, the Black Wraith departed.

Turning, the Soul Ferrywoman winked at Fubao.

"Had enough fun, little imp?"

Fubao gazed up in admiration.

"Granny, you're incredible!"

A soft huff escaped her, though her ears turned pink.

"Enough of that."

Kneeling to Fubao's level, she met the child's eyes.

"Time to send you back."

Fubao suddenly hugged her neck.

"Can I visit you again, Granny?"

The question caught her off guard.

After a long pause, a quiet "Mm" escaped her.

Fubao bounced with joy.

"Pinky promise!"

Eyeing the tiny extended finger, the Soul Ferrywoman reluctantly linked hers.

"Troublesome child."

Yet the corners of her mouth lifted imperceptibly.

Eight uncles' frantic calls echoed in the distance.

Waving reluctantly, Fubao called,

"Bye, Granny!"

Standing at the bridge's edge, the Soul Ferrywoman watched the skipping figure disappear.

Her fingers brushed the candies in her pocket.

"Little imp..."

Her voice held unconscious tenderness.
###Chapter 322

The black sedan glided to a stop by the school gates.

Cheng Yannan's slender fingers rested on the steering wheel, his knuckles pronounced. He leaned over to unbuckle her seatbelt, his familiar cedar scent mingling with last night's lingering desire.

Lu Zhixian's spine stiffened instantly.

The back of his hand brushed against her silk skirt, sending tiny shivers across her skin beneath. Unbidden images flooded her mind—how those same hands had pinned her down, how his ragged breaths had whispered her name against her ear.

"We're here."

She practically fled the moment the door opened. His gaze burned against the nape of her neck like a physical touch.

Rounding the corner, a sharp pain shot through her thighs. Biting her lip, she ducked into a pharmacy and grabbed an anti-inflammatory cream with trembling fingers. The contraceptive aisle stood nearby, but the line of classmates at the register sent her fleeing again.

The dorm was empty.

Steam fogged the bathroom mirror, revealing the constellation of marks across her body. Finger-shaped bruises bloomed along her waist. Teeth marks marred her inner thighs. Worst were the crimson trails from collarbone to abdomen—evidence of his insatiable hunger last night.

She gasped when soap grazed tender flesh.

Applying the ointment made her grip the sink from the sting. As she gathered her discarded clothes, a streak of red stopped her cold.

Her period had come early.

At least this spared her the pharmacy embarrassment. She hastily secured a pad before colliding with her returning roommate in the doorway.

"Look who finally graced us with her presence." Song Wanyi leaned against the doorframe, her manicure glinting. "Out all night, were we? Don't tell me you—"

"None of your business."

Lu Zhixian shoved the soiled clothes into the trash. Their feud had started during freshman year over some meaningless campus beauty poll.

Xu Xuxu intervened. "You're coming to the alumni event, right? Cheng Yannan's giving the keynote!"

Lu Zhixian's hairbrush clattered to the floor.

"But he declined ages ago! The forums are blowing up!" Xu Xuxu shook her shoulders. "That cross-border merger case got added to textbooks last month. And have you seen him in a suit? That waistline—"

"I'm not going."

"What? He's walking temptation! Those hands holding a pen—imagine them elsewhere..."

Lu Zhixian choked on her water.

By 2 PM, Xu Xuxu had dragged her to the auditorium. When the black Phaeton appeared, she instinctively shrank into the crowd.

Gasps rippled as Cheng Yannan emerged. Today's gold-rimmed glasses and fully buttoned suit projected icy restraint that made knees weak.

"Look at his hands!" Xu Xuxu pinched her arm. "Imagine them on your—"

His gaze suddenly swept their direction.

Lu Zhixian's blood froze. Those eyes skimmed her flushed ears before moving on. Only she knew how those "Midas touch" fingers had orchestrated last night's tempest.

His microphone-amplified voice vibrated through her chest. Girls whispered about his "untouchable" aura, unaware of the beast beneath that polished exterior.

When he unbuttoned his jacket during closing remarks, the room buzzed. Lu Zhixian fixed her eyes on the floor—the wrinkled shirt tail peeking out still bore her claw marks.
###Chapter 323

Sophia Laurent's gaze pierced through Victoria Lowell like a dagger.

"Twenty-three years ago, the Lowell family maid Li Hongzhen—do you really not remember?"

Victoria's eyes widened abruptly.

"It was her! She resigned right after I gave birth. I regretted losing such a good maid..."

A mocking smile curled Sophia's lips.

"Did you know she's the biological sister of the butcher's wife?"

The living room froze into silence.

"What?" Victoria's face turned ashen. "They're sisters?"

Richard Lowell remained silent, his brows furrowed.

Li Hongzhen frantically waved her hands.

"Madam, I cut ties with them long ago! The hospital's baby mix-up had nothing to do with me!"

Li Hongxia sobbed in defense.

"Mrs. Lowell, we haven't spoken in over twenty years. This was truly an accident..."

Emily Lowell's tears fell like rain.

"Sophia, do you hate me this much?"

She bowed deeply to the Lowell couple.

"Mom, Dad... I don't deserve to be your daughter..."

William Lowell stepped forward urgently.

"Sophia, let's discuss this calmly!"

Sophia gave him an icy glance.

"I wasn't finished speaking. Why the hurry?"

Nathan Lowell suddenly spoke up.

"William, what has Sophia actually done wrong?"

His conflicted gaze settled on Emily.

That tear-streaked face used to make him rush to her defense without hesitation.

Now, it only looked deceitful.

William glared at his younger brother.

"Have you forgotten who caused your current situation?"

Nathan frowned.

"I'm just stating facts."

The butcher glared venomously at Sophia, his eyes filled with silent threats.

Sophia ignored him, turning back to the Li sisters.

"What a coincidence—the sister's child lives in luxury while the employer's daughter suffered in your home?"

She enunciated each word clearly.

"Or did you always know I wasn't their biological child?"

Li Hongxia's eyes darted nervously.

"Sophia, I was just strict with you—"

Sophia cut her off with a cold laugh.

"Don't call me your daughter! Now I understand why you could be so cruel..."

Her sharp gaze shifted to Emily.

"And you—are you truly innocent?"
###Chapter 324

Sophia Laurent's clear voice echoed through the living room.

"If I was intentionally switched at birth, then Emily Lowell was complicit."

Victoria Lowell's face turned deathly pale. She swayed on her feet, nearly collapsing.

Nathan Lowell rushed forward and steadied her.

"Why?" Victoria's voice trembled. "The Lowells treated you well. Why would you steal my child?"

Nathan's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Isn't it obvious? They wanted the Lowell fortune."

Richard Lowell and William Lowell stood frozen, struggling to process the revelation.

Tears streamed down Emily's face like broken pearls.

After a long silence, William finally found his voice.

"Sophia, do you have proof that this was intentional?"

A mocking smile played on Sophia's lips.

"Proof?"

"Margaret Clementson and Margaret Delaney are sisters. One worked as a maid for the Lowells, while the other conveniently gave birth the same day as my mother. Then they just happened to 'accidentally' switch babies. How many coincidences is that?"

Henry Chamberlain added calmly, "Only careful planning could create so many 'coincidences.'"

William's heart ached at the sight of Emily's tear-streaked face.

"This is all speculation. You have no hard evidence."

Sophia nearly laughed at his willful ignorance.

"Let the police find the evidence."

Her tone remained composed. "Hospital surveillance footage is backed up every three months. The witnesses from that time are still alive. The truth will come out."

At these words, the Delaney sisters paled.

Margaret's husband suddenly adopted a pitiful expression.

"Sophia, I raised you all these years as a butcher. Is this how you repay me?"

Margaret burst into loud sobs. "After everything I've done for you! This is how you treat your own mother?"

Margaret Delaney wailed, "Mr. and Mrs. Lowell, I've served your family faithfully for decades. How could I do something so wicked?"

Before Sophia could respond, Nathan exploded with rage.

"Stop playing the victim! You made a little girl wash your clothes and cook for you in freezing winters. Some parents you were!"

His outburst left everyone stunned.

A flicker of surprise crossed Sophia's eyes before her expression smoothed over.

"Don't worry. The police will deliver justice to everyone involved."

With that, she had the Delaney family escorted straight to the police station.
###Chapter 325

The butcher surnamed Su, realizing his pleas for mercy were futile, let out a savage roar.

"You little bitch! Just wait till I get out—I'll skin you alive!"

"I should've thrown you to the pigs when I had the chance!"

"What do I care about rotting in prison? You'll pay for this!"

His thick arms flailed wildly, the scar on his face twisting with fury.

Victoria Lowell stumbled back, terrified by his monstrous rage.

Her heart shattered as she stared at Sophia's slender frame.

Was this the environment her daughter had grown up in?

Trembling, she reached out—only for Sophia to step aside.

"Sophia?" Her voice quivered.

"I'm not here for a family reunion."

Sophia watched impassively as bodyguards dragged the butcher's family away.

"They abused me. You neglected me."

She would never forget the disdainful glances and cruel words when she first returned to the Lowell family.

Her own brothers had always been Emily's most loyal defenders.

"Today, I came to reveal the truth."

She methodically exposed the baby-swapping scheme orchestrated by the Li sisters.

Without Margaret's accidental discovery, this secret might have remained buried forever.

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

She wondered—how would the Lowells treat their beloved adopted daughter now?

Emily chose that moment to step forward.

Tears streamed down her face as she whispered, "I'm so sorry, sister... I'll leave right away..."

Turning to the family, she sobbed dramatically.

"I know I don't deserve—"

William cut her off impatiently.

"Stop talking nonsense, Emily! You were just a child!"

He yanked Nathan's sleeve.

"Back me up, Nathan! Blame those two old hags, not her!"

His glare burned into Sophia.

"Don't think you can twist this to your advantage!"
###Chapter 326

William Lowell's heart clenched, fearing his parents would take their anger out on Emily. He discreetly nudged Nathan, signaling him to defuse the situation.

Nathan remained unmoved.

His gaze was icy, the usual arrogance gone. "Is Emily truly innocent? Can she really sever ties with her biological parents? If she's blameless, then what about Sophia suffering in the Li family?"

The living room fell deathly silent.

Victoria clutched the hem of her dress. The thought of her real daughter being maliciously switched made her heart twist in agony. The fact that Li Hongzhen and Li Hongxia were sisters proved this was no accident.

Her eyes filled with remorse as she looked at Sophia.

Emily trembled, staring at Nathan in disbelief. "Fourth brother... I know I've wronged my sister... I wish it had been me who suffered..."

Her tearful expression slightly eased the tension.

William shot Nathan a glare. "Must you humiliate Emily?"

"Do I look happy that my sister was schemed against?" Nathan stood his ground.

That response ignited William's fury.

"Just because she revised your sheet music? Don't forget who ruined your future! Emily has always been good to you—is this how you repay her?"

Nathan pressed his lips together and said nothing.

Seizing his silence, William turned to Sophia. "Did you come back today just to cause trouble for Emily?"

Sophia leaned lazily against the chair, a faint smile playing on her lips. "What if I did?"

"You're determined to make her life difficult?" William's face darkened.

"Jealous of her?" Sophia chuckled. "What does she have that I'd envy? More money than me?"

The mention of money cooled William's temper.

He sighed, his tone softening. "Sophia, I'm not playing favorites. You're both my sisters. This conflict hurts everyone."

"Family?" Sophia smirked. "What were those three just now, then?"

William scoffed. "Emily never associates with them. They share nothing but blood."

Emily nodded eagerly. "Sister is right... Family is about choice..."

"And you all still believe that?" Sophia scanned the room.

Victoria and Nathan stayed silent.

Only William declared firmly, "Emily will always be our family."

"Fine." Sophia clapped lightly, her laughter cold.
###Chapter 327

Sophia Laurent clapped her hands lightly. The sharp sound echoed through the living room.

"William Lowell, your stupidity is truly one of a kind."

William's face darkened. "What do you mean?"

"You emptied your savings for Emily Lowell, yet she used the Lowell family's money to buy property for her biological parents." Sophia's lips curved slightly. "Perhaps she thinks deceiving you brings you more joy?"

William's pupils constricted. "What property?"

The entire room fell silent. All eyes turned to Emily.

Tears welled up in Emily's eyes as her shoulders trembled slightly.

"They forced me..."

She didn't dare deny it. If Sophia dared to say it, she must have evidence.

Emily's fingers dug deep into her palms. She silently vowed to make Sophia pay.

Victoria Lowell's teacup shattered on the floor.

Nathan Lowell let out a cold laugh, his eyes filled with mockery.

William looked thunderstruck. He'd sold the house gifted for his coming-of-age ceremony and scrimped to give Emily an allowance, only for her to hand it over to those butcher parents?

Even the cheapest suburban property cost millions.

Richard Lowell frowned. "Emily said she was forced. What more do you want?"

William's expression softened slightly.

Sophia chuckled. "This is a society governed by law. How could they force you?" Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "Unless... you have some unspeakable secret they're holding over you?"

Emily paled and shook her head frantically. "They threatened... to take me back..."

"I just didn't want to leave this family..."

William patted her head affectionately. "Silly girl, why didn't you tell us if you were in trouble?"
###Chapter 328

Nathan Lowell stood stiffly, his brow furrowed.

"William, you need to wake up."

His gaze lingered on his elder brother, seeing a reflection of his past self.

He too had once blindly defended Emily.

Thankfully, he'd come to his senses in time.

He only wondered when William would see the truth.

"Emily isn't a Lowell. She's an adult—it's time she stood on her own."

William's head snapped up, fury burning in his eyes.

"What are you implying?"

Nathan's expression remained impassive. "Exactly what I said."

Ever since discovering Emily's years of bullying Sophia, he could no longer tolerate this impostor sister.

Let alone after learning Sophia had been deliberately taken by that butcher's family.

"Have you lost your mind?" William's voice rose sharply. "How is Emily supposed to survive outside this family?"

Nathan's icy stare cut through him. "Was Sophia not a girl too?"

The question plunged the room into dead silence.

When they'd brought Sophia home, they'd abandoned her at the old estate just because Emily threw a tantrum.

And how had Sophia repaid them?

Victoria Lowell's tears streamed freely. "Sophia, I was wrong. Please come home."

When Sophia remained unmoved, she added desperately, "Your father and brothers will treat you better—"

"Unnecessary." Sophia's lips curved slightly. "I only came today to watch the show."

She paused meaningfully. "You didn't disappoint."

She wondered if they'd remain so composed during the next act.

Her gaze lingered on Emily before she turned to leave.

"Stop right there!" Richard Lowell finally spoke.

His question came bluntly: "Sophia, how long do you think the Valdemars will keep you around?"

He ignored Henry Chamberlain's presence. "A pawn's glory never lasts."

"No concern of yours." Sophia's smile deepened. "My fortunes—good or ill—are no longer tied to this family."

Suddenly she countered, "Do you know why I refuse to help you?"

"Why?" Richard indeed couldn't comprehend it.

Sophia had sacrificed so much for the Lowells before.

By his calculations, her marriage into the Valdemars should have made her their perfect puppet.

With her capabilities, she could have elevated Lowell Entertainment to new heights.

Her abrupt betrayal had blindsided him.

"Tell me—what would I gain by obeying you?" Her mocking stare pinned him.

Richard faltered.

The question had never crossed his mind.

Had Sophia followed his script, she'd have remained nothing but a compliant marionette.

As Sophia's retreating figure disappeared, Victoria clutched her chest as if stabbed.

For the first time, genuine terror gripped her.

Somehow she knew—Sophia would never look back again.
###Chapter 329

Richard Lowell's face darkened like storm clouds.

But he would never discard Emily Lowell as his pawn.

Compared to the rebellious Sophia Laurent, the obedient Emily was far easier to control.

Once Emily married into the Cunningham family, Lowell Entertainment could leverage their resources to reach new heights.

"Emily, don't overthink it." Richard forced a smile. "The fault lies with those butcher parents, not you."

His tone dripped with saccharine falseness. "You'll always be the jewel of the Lowell family."

Emily's eyes reddened. "Thank you, Father."

Only then did William Lowell's tense expression soften.

"This will always be your home."

Nathan Lowell watched coldly before turning away.

Victoria Lowell stood silently, a nagging unease twisting in her gut.

Regret flooded her.

If only she'd treated Sophia better back then...

But there were no second chances in life.

Emily began appearing frequently beside Ryan Cunningham.

Under William's arrangement, she smoothly took over Sophia's former position at Lowell Entertainment.

Sophia had wielded real authority during her tenure—decisive and formidable.

Emily merely served as a decorative figurehead.

Employees initially buzzed with curiosity about the rumored heiress.

After the online scandals and kidnapping case, scrutiny intensified.

But the truth quickly became apparent—

This so-called business prodigy only knew how to simper and flirt.

"I just saw her sitting on William's lap when I delivered documents!"

"Thought she'd be some corporate genius. Turns out she's all looks, no substance."

"Can't hold a candle to Sophia..."

Emily ignored the whispers.

She had one singular goal—

Steal the core code for the surgical automaton.

That was her bargaining chip to secure the Cunningham marriage.

Ryan, young and accomplished, was a far better catch than that vegetative Alexander Valdemar.

Sophia prepared for the charity gala.

Her first public appearance as Mrs. Valdemar.

The Valdemar family's long-awaited return to the social spotlight.

That evening—

A moon-white cheongsam hugged her slender curves.

Jade accessories accentuated her regal elegance.

Every head turned when she entered the ballroom.

Rumors about this mysterious Mrs. Valdemar had swirled for months.

Now, everyone burned with curiosity—

What kind of woman could single-handedly salvage the Valdemar empire during its darkest hour?
###Chapter 330

The Valdemar family's upheaval sent shockwaves through high society. Sophia Laurent's appearance at Valdemar Group's press conference had already made her a familiar figure.

Now, her physical presence instantly made her the center of attention.

Her raven-black hair cascaded down, accentuating her porcelain skin. Those limpid eyes held an autumn-like depth, and every gesture exuded aristocratic grace.

Gasps of admiration rippled through the crowd.

"Mrs. Valdemar, I've heard so much about you. I'm Quentin Wu from Summit Group."

"Madame Valdemar, Leonard Lin from Lin Corporation."

"You were breathtaking in the video, but reality surpasses even that."

Sophia's lips curved slightly as she gracefully acknowledged each guest. Her poised elegance made onlookers pause to admire her.

In a dim corner, Gabrielle Winston clutched her champagne flute until her knuckles turned white.

"Just a pawn of the Valdemars. How dare she flaunt herself here?"

Isabella Evans sipped her drink, amused. "Still holding a grudge after all this time?"

"That bitch slapped me in the hospital!" Gabrielle's eyes burned with fury. "I'll make sure she's ruined."

Isabella shook her head. "Ethan would scold you again if he knew..."

At the mention of her brother, Gabrielle's expression darkened further.

"He's been bewitched by that vixen. Completely obsessed..."

What infuriated her most was that this woman carried Winston blood while marrying into the Valdemar family.

The mere thought made Gabrielle tremble with rage.

Yet she couldn't expose the secret.

The Winston family was a nest of vipers, with illegitimate heirs circling like sharks. Without an alliance with the Evans family, Ethan's position as heir would be precarious.

But her brother remained stubbornly devoted to that tramp.

"Just wait," Gabrielle sneered. "Her days are numbered..."

Isabella arched a brow. "Oh?"

"With Alexander's accident, the Valdemars need her as a shield." Gabrielle lowered her voice. "Once the storm passes, she'll be nothing."

Isabella swirled her glass, a hint of mockery in her eyes.

"Perhaps Patriarch Valdemar genuinely values her?"

"Her?" Gabrielle scoffed. "Not even good enough for the Winstons. Why would the Valdemars treasure her?"

She lifted her chin and strutted toward the crowd's center.

"Well, if it isn't the Valdemars' lucky charm bride! How shameless to parade yourself here."

Her shrill voice cut through the banquet hall's hum. All eyes turned toward them.

Recognizing the Winston heiress, guests maintained a tactful silence.

Some exchanged knowing glances.

The Valdemars' therapeutic marriage was an open secret, but no one dared mention it outright.

Sophia slowly raised her gaze. "Are you implying, Miss Winston, that marrying Alexander is disgraceful?"
###Chapter 331

The words cut too deep.

Though the Winstons and Valdemars were connected by marriage, such insolence was unacceptable.

"You misunderstand," Gabrielle Winston hastily defended. "I meant you're unworthy."

Sophia Laurent remained silent.

The crude remark left her momentarily speechless.

Sophia didn't flare with anger. A faint smile curled her lips as she regarded Gabrielle with pity.

Grace versus hysteria.

The difference in breeding was obvious.

Though the surrounding guests maintained polite smiles, their disdainful glances pricked at Gabrielle like needles.

The spoiled heiress had never endured such humiliation.

Blind with rage, she suddenly hurled her wine glass at Sophia.

"Who do you think you are? How dare you compete with me?"

Sophia sidestepped the attack with practiced ease. Wine splashed across the floor, staining several guests' attire.

The amused spectators' expressions darkened instantly.

A glacial glint flashed in Sophia's eyes. "Is this how the Winstons raise their children?"

She turned to the flustered event organizer. "If this is the caliber of guests at your functions, the Valdemars will no longer require invitations."

Her commanding presence silenced the room.

The organizer wiped his brow. "Mrs. Valdemar, please understand—we can't control individual behavior."

Caught between two powerful families, he was trapped.

"I'll have the mess cleaned immediately."

Sophia scoffed and turned to leave.

As matriarch of the Valdemar family, upholding their dignity was non-negotiable.

The organizer panicked at her decisive exit.

"Mrs. Valdemar, wait! We'll make this right."

He hurried after her, already deciding his course.

Sophia paused. "How?"

Mopping his forehead, he declared, "Miss Winston's conduct was unacceptable. She'll be escorted out."

Gabrielle exploded. "How dare you!"

The organizer nearly fainted.

This spoiled brat would be his undoing.

His expression hardened. "This is a charity gala. Decorum is expected."

The unspoken message: Gabrielle had disgraced herself.

Before she could protest, security moved in to "assist" her departure.

A polite expulsion.

By tomorrow, this scandal would ripple through high society.

Gabrielle's future invitations would dry up instantly.

Humiliated before the elite, her face burned crimson.

She glared venomously at Sophia, sputtering, "You'll never be welcome in the Winston family!"

Sophia regarded her with one last pitying glance.

"Security," she said coolly. "Remove this lunatic."
###Chapter 332

Sophia Laurent couldn't fathom why Ethan Winston and Gabrielle Winston were so convinced she had no choice but to marry into their family.

If not for that accident three years ago when Ethan saved her life, their paths would never have crossed.

She had given their three-year relationship her all.

Was it too much to ask for a dignified breakup?

Isabella Evans feigned concern beside her. "Sophia, Gabrielle is still young and impulsive. Don't take it to heart."

"Young?" Sophia's lips curled in derision.

"Sorry, but I'm not her guardian. I have no obligation to indulge her tantrums."

A few muffled chuckles rippled through the crowd.

Gabrielle flushed crimson, shooting Sophia a venomous glare. "You'll regret this!"

She stormed out, slamming the door behind her.

Sophia turned her attention to Isabella.

Gabrielle might be foolish, but this hostility undoubtedly stemmed from the woman before her.

Isabella met her gaze with a挑衅的smirk.

"Such harsh words, Sophia. Aren't you afraid of upsetting Ethan?"

Sophia冷笑. "Not everyone shares your taste for discarded trash."

She strode toward the VIP section.

The Valdemar Group's seats dominated the prime位置at tonight's charity auction.

Isabella watched her retreating figure, eyes darkening.

Her phone vibrated.

A message from Gabrielle: Make sure you win that ruby necklace for me!

Isabella typed a curt reply: I know.

Meanwhile, Gabrielle was already dialing Ethan.

"Brother, were you blind when you fell for that Sophia Laurent?"

Ethan's voice turned cold. "Watch your tone. She's going to be your sister-in-law."

"Over my dead body! Mother would never accept her!"

"I've already说服her." His tone brooked no argument.

Alexander Valdemar's near-fatal car crash had rendered that marriage void.

Besides, Sophia was no longer the same woman—founder of Pearl Group, acclaimed musician, the Lowells'千金.

These credentials had finally swayed Mrs. Winston.

Gabrielle gasped. "Mother agreed?"

"Yes." Ethan exhaled. "Stay out of her way from now on."

"Never!" Gabrielle shrieked. "What about Isabella? You loved her first!"

"That's ancient history." His voice hardened. "My heart belongs to Sophia now."

"I won't allow it!"

Isabella had always doted on her—indulging her whims, securing her that coveted internship at Versini Couture.

The crème de la crème of fashion houses.

To Gabrielle, Sophia wasn't fit to lick Isabella's boots.
###Chapter 333

"Third Brother, you're the best." Xiao Jiayuan gazed up with adoration shining in his eyes. "You're noble and so brilliant."

A flicker of amusement crossed Jun Lie's face. "And yet you still want my help?"

"Absolutely!" Xiao Jiayuan nodded vigorously. "I'll be forever grateful. If you ever need me, I'll move mountains for you."

He paused, then added, "As long as it's not something wicked or harmful to my family."

Jun Lie chuckled. "Do I strike you as that kind of person?"

"Not at all." Xiao Jiayuan scratched his head with a sheepish grin.

Jun Lie's expression turned serious. "You're your sister's only brother. Protect her well. A woman of her caliber deserves nothing less than an exceptional man."

Xiao Jiayuan clenched his fists, his small face taut with determination. "Don't worry, Third Brother. I'll fight anyone who dares hurt her!"

"Good lad." Jun Lie gave an approving pat to his shoulder.

"Young Master, Your Highness, dinner is ready." Jifu's soft voice carried from beyond the door.

Xiao Jiayuan's eyes lit up. "Third Brother, Sister's hot pot is amazing! You'll love it."

The aromatic steam of the simmering broth filled the air, surrounded by platters of fresh ingredients. Xiao Jiayuan pointed eagerly. "These meat rolls are super tender—you won't stop at just one!"

For the first time that evening, he resembled a carefree child.

"It does smell incredible." Jun Lie inhaled deeply.

Guo Yang leaned in discreetly. "Your Highness, it's time to depart."

Jun Lie hesitated, watching the flickering candlelight. "Jiayuan, I'll have to take a rain check."

"Third Brother!" Xiao Jiayuan protested. "Can't you stay just for dinner—"

"Urgent matters call." Jun Lie softened his tone. "Write to me if you need help with your studies."

Xiao Jiayuan's face fell. "Does Sister know?"

"Your Highness is leaving already?" Xiao Jiuyue entered with freshly sliced meat and homemade spicy beef jerky. "At least have a proper meal before you go."

"Affairs in the capital demand my attention." Jun Lie's gaze lingered on her mended cloak.

Xiao Jiuyue turned swiftly. "Lianxin, pack these in thermal containers with cotton insulation."

She efficiently bundled the provisions. "Take these for the road—meat slices, jerky, and hot pot broth. Just add water to heat."

"My thanks." Jun Lie accepted the parcel.

"Safe travels." Xiao Jiuyue smiled warmly before addressing her brother. "Jiayuan, see His Highness out."

Footprints trailed across the snow. Xiao Jiuyue stared at the half-empty dining table where the pot still bubbled merrily.

"Sister, why did Third Brother leave so suddenly?" Xiao Jiayuan frowned.

Xiao Jiuyue guided him back to his seat. "His position comes with responsibilities. Now, keep me company—let's enjoy this hot pot."

She dipped a slice of meat into the broth. "What did you and His Highness discuss today?"

"He helped me with my studies." Xiao Jiayuan launched into an animated account of his lessons, carefully omitting their private pact.

Xiao Jiuyue arched an eyebrow. "That's all?"

"Mm-hm!" He nodded vigorously. "I wanted to learn martial arts from Master Guo too, but there wasn't time."

Xiao Jiuyue tapped his forehead playfully. "Jinwen and the others might get jealous."

"They'd cheer me on!" Xiao Jiayuan grinned. "Sister, may I visit the county seat on my day off?"

"What for?"

"Tranquil Bookhouse has excellent selections." He blinked innocently, mentally adding: This isn't lying—I am going to learn how to protect her.
###Chapter 334

Sophia Laurent's gaze lingered on the gilded tea set displayed on the auction block.

The intricate gold tracery shimmered under the lights, every detail exuding opulence.

She casually raised her paddle. "Two point one million."

Isabella Evans immediately countered. "Two point two million."

"Two point three million."

"Two point four million."

After two bids, Sophia suddenly stopped.

The price quickly soared to four point five million as other bidders joined the fray.

"Four point six million," Sophia spoke again.

Isabella didn't hesitate. "Four point seven million."

"Five million."

"Five point one million."

"Five point five million."

"Five point six million."

Isabella stubbornly matched every bid with a minimal ten-thousand increase.

Sophia turned to study her, brows slightly furrowed.

A glint of triumph flashed in Isabella's eyes.

"Five point six million going once... sold!"

When the gavel fell, Sophia didn't raise her paddle again.

Isabella lifted her chin with a victor's smile.

The Valdemar heiress wasn't so impressive after all.

The next lot soon appeared.

"A 5A-grade tanzanite necklace. Starting bid at three hundred thousand."

Sophia immediately raised her paddle. "One million."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Isabella chuckled and countered. "One point one million."

"Two million."

"Two point one million."

"Three million." Sophia's bids came without hesitation.

The price had already far exceeded market value.

Isabella kept pace. "Three point one million."

Whispers spread among the guests.

Everyone recognized this escalating duel.

After a brief silence, Sophia suddenly declared: "Five million."

The room fell utterly still.

The staggering jump left the audience breathless.
###Chapter 335

The crystal chandelier in the auction hall cast dazzling reflections across Isabella Evans' pale face.

Her gaze locked onto the 5A-grade tanzanite necklace displayed on the podium. Her fingernails dug into her palms unconsciously.

"Five million one hundred thousand!"

Isabella suddenly raised her bidding paddle. Her voice cut through the silent venue like a blade.

She shot a challenging look toward Sophia Laurent.

Sophia's almond-shaped eyes narrowed slightly. Her red lips curved into a faint, enigmatic smile.

The auctioneer's gavel struck with excitement.

"Congratulations, Miss Evans!"

As the auction continued, Isabella seemed possessed.

Every time Sophia raised her paddle, she immediately countered with a higher bid.

"Seven million eight hundred thousand!"

"Nine million two hundred thousand!"

"Thirteen million!"

Each bid drew astonished glances from the crowd.

Isabella reveled in the attention.

Then the antique ruby necklace was unveiled.

The room erupted.

"Twenty million!"

"Twenty-five million!"

The price skyrocketed at a staggering pace.

Only then did Isabella realize she'd already squandered over thirty million.

Her eyes darted toward Sophia.

The other woman was calmly admiring the necklace, showing no intention of bidding.

A sheen of sweat broke out on Isabella's forehead.

Her father's warning echoed in her mind.

"Two million maximum."

Worse, she'd already spent most of the fifty million entrusted to her by Gabrielle Winston.

"Thirty-six million!"

Isabella gritted her teeth as she announced the figure.

Gasps filled the room.

Her eyes burned into Sophia's back.

Sophia remained motionless.

Isabella's heart plummeted.
###Chapter 336

Isabella Evans suddenly realized she had squandered thirty-four million dollars just to spite Sophia Laurent.

The twenty million from the Evans family was long gone. Even Gabrielle Winston's fourteen million had been drained.

In the auction hall, bidding for the ruby necklace continued to climb.

"Thirty-one million."

Amidst the flurry of raised paddles, Isabella gritted her teeth and called out, "Thirty-six million."

She upped the bid by five million in one go, hoping to intimidate other bidders.

The tactic worked.

Many buyers shook their heads and withdrew.

News of Isabella's reckless bidding spree had already spread through elite circles.

She had been paying twenty, even thirty times the market value for items, earning her the reputation of the auction house's "madwoman."

Even Sophia, who had been on a winning streak, had backed down against her.

Though the antique necklace was exquisite, no one wanted to challenge a madwoman.

Seeing the crowd retreat, Isabella exhaled in quiet relief.

She had gambled and won.

The auctioneer began the countdown. "Thirty-six million, going once... Thirty-six million, going twice—"

"Forty million."

A cool, feminine voice cut through the room.

All eyes turned toward the source.

Sophia sat poised in her seat, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Her bright eyes glittered under the chandeliers.

Isabella's face paled.

Forty million—she couldn't possibly match that.

Only then did the truth crash down on her.
###Chapter 337

Ethan Winston had just arrived at the venue entrance when Gabrielle's shrill voice pierced his ears.

His brow furrowed slightly as he quickened his pace.

"What's the matter now?"

Tears immediately welled up in Gabrielle's eyes at the sight of her brother.

"Sophia Laurent stole my necklace!"

Her knuckles turned white from gripping her dress too tightly.

"The ruby necklace you told me to bid for!"

Ethan remained impassive.

"It's just a necklace. You can buy another one."

"No!"

Gabrielle screamed hysterically.

"I already bragged about it to all my friends!"

She suddenly clutched Ethan's arm.

"If I don't get that necklace, I'd rather die!"

Ethan's expression darkened instantly.

"Don't be ridiculous!"

After a brief silence, he finally relented.

"I'll go take a look."

Gabrielle's tears vanished instantly.

"You're the best brother ever!"

Ethan shook his head helplessly and entered the auction hall with a waiter's guidance.

"Forty million going once..."

The auctioneer's voice dragged on.

Ethan's gaze swept across the room before he raised his paddle under Isabella's expectant stare.

"Forty-one million."

He took his seat gracefully, coincidentally next to Isabella.

"Ethan!"

Isabella leaned in eagerly.

She shot Sophia a challenging look, only to find the other woman completely unperturbed.

"Fifty million."

Sophia's cool voice rang out.

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

Ethan turned sharply.

Sophia's delicate profile remained impassive, her lashes not even fluttering.

"Mrs. Valdemar bids fifty million!" The auctioneer's voice trembled with excitement.

Isabella tugged at Ethan's sleeve anxiously.

"Gabrielle is still waiting outside!"

Ethan stared at Sophia's silhouette, his Adam's apple bobbing.

Finally, he slowly lowered his bidding paddle.

He decided to discuss this with Sophia after the auction.
###Chapter 338

Isabella's nails dug deep into her palms.

The ruby necklace meant nothing to her.

It was Sophia's triumphant smile that she couldn't stand.

"Ethan," Isabella whispered, eyes glinting with calculation. "Gabrielle will cry when she finds out the necklace was stolen from her."

Ethan's gaze lingered on Sophia, radiant across the room. "I'll talk to her."

A cold smirk twisted Isabella's lips.

Was he really going to beg for it back?

The auctioneer's voice boomed through the hall. "Congratulations, Mrs. Valdemar!"

"Only the best for Mrs. Valdemar!"

"Some people put on quite a show, only to lose spectacularly."

Sophia accepted the applause gracefully, never once glancing toward Ethan.

"Are you acquainted with Mr. Winston?" someone ventured.

Sophia smiled coolly. "Not really."

Curious eyes darted between the three of them, the air thick with unspoken gossip.

The rest of the auction proceeded smoothly.

Sophia claimed a yellow diamond bracelet, a pink diamond ring, and an imperial jade bangle—totaling three hundred million.

The crowd buzzed.

Isabella stared daggers at Sophia, surrounded by admirers.

Wasn't this woman just a glorified nurse for the Valdemar heir?

Since when did she have this kind of authority?

Reporters swarmed.

"Mrs. Valdemar, won't the family object to such extravagant spending?"

Sophia's lips curved. "The Valdemars don't lack for money."

The remark trended instantly.

Standing beside Ethan, Isabella burned with envy.

The entire evening, she'd been the punchline, subjected to veiled sneers.

Finally, it ended.

Sophia completed the paperwork and headed for the parking lot.

"Sophia!"

She froze at the familiar voice.

Turning, she faced Ethan and a furious Gabrielle.

"Sophia! How dare you take my necklace?" Gabrielle shrieked.

Sophia arched a brow. "Did the asylum grant you day leave?"

Gabrielle lunged, but Ethan held her back.

"Sophia," he said gently. "We just want to discuss transferring the necklace."

Sophia scoffed. "Why would I?"

Ethan frowned. "Give it to me. It'll still be yours eventually. Why let the Valdemars have it?"

Sophia looked at him like he'd lost his mind. "Are you delusional?"
###Chapter 339

Ethan Winston's gaze burned into Sophia Laurent. "You'll leave the Valdemar family eventually, won't you?"

Sophia's brow furrowed slightly. "None of your business."

Ethan sighed.

"Sophia, after all these years together, I don't believe you can just cut ties so easily. When you've calmed down, you can always come to me. I'll be waiting."

He paused. "Consider that necklace a gift. Better it stays with you than in the Valdemar household, don't you think?"

Sophia remained silent.

"Disgusting. Don't you own a mirror? Or at least have some self-awareness?"

She turned to enter her car.

Ethan quickly blocked her path.

"Sophia, let's talk privately?"

"No time." Her refusal was crisp.

Ethan's expression darkened. "Then I'll go speak with Patriarch Valdemar."

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

"Don't worry. I know you only married Alexander out of necessity. I can help you."

"Are you insane?" Sophia scoffed. "Ethan, did you get hit in the head or something?"

Ethan ignored her remark.

Gabrielle Winston couldn't resist interjecting.

"Sophia, don't be ungrateful! Having my brother's affection is a privilege you don't deserve. Think you're special just because you're carrying some bastard?"

Her eyes flicked pointedly toward Sophia's abdomen.

"Let's see how long you last in the Valdemar family once Patriarch finds out about your little accident."

Sophia's breath hitched.

Gabrielle knew about the pregnancy.

A sidelong glance confirmed Ethan's clueless expression, allowing her to relax slightly.

"Go ahead and tell them." Sophia curved her lips.

The secret wouldn't stay hidden forever.

Worst case scenario, she'd leave the Valdemars. It didn't matter to her.

Sophia turned her icy gaze back to Ethan.

"Listen carefully. With a mother and sister like yours, there's zero chance I'd ever reconnect with you. If you have any sense, stay out of my sight from now on."

Ethan paled.

The realization struck him—even if Sophia left the Valdemars, she would never return to him.

The thought carved through his heart.

Only when Sophia's car disappeared from view did he snap out of his daze.

Gabrielle continued her venomous tirade.

Slap!

A sharp crack silenced her.

Gabrielle clutched her cheek, eyes wide with disbelief. "You hit me? For that bitch?"

Ethan's face was glacial. "How dare you insult her like that?"

Malice flickered in Gabrielle's eyes.

She would ruin Sophia Laurent.

A woman carrying another man's child had no right to marry into the Valdemar family.

She'd expose this shameful secret to the world.
###Chapter 340

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the private sanatorium atop Valdemar Holdings, casting golden patterns across Alexander Valdemar's hospital bed.

Patriarch Valdemar sipped his tea, admiration flickering in his eyes. "Your wife is quite astute. She understood the auction's purpose without needing explicit instructions."

Alexander's slender fingers scrolled through Henry Chamberlain's detailed report on Sophia Laurent's every move at the gala.

The corner of his mouth lifted. "Remarkable, indeed."

After a pause, he added, "Bold. Visionary."

Daring to spend three hundred million under public scrutiny required nerves of steel—a quality few possessed.

Precisely what the Valdemars needed now: a signal to the world that their empire remained unshaken.

The old man studied his grandson with knowing eyes. "Rare praise from you."

He set down his teacup. "When did the doctors say you could walk again?"

"Two weeks." Alexander met his gaze. "Just in time for the Eden Project relaunch meeting."

The patriarch nodded approvingly. "Perfect timing."

Sophia's high-profile appearance had already rattled Vincent Valdemar's faction.

Two weeks would be enough for them to slip up.

The Eden Project meeting would be the ideal moment to spring the trap.

The auction made seismic waves across social media.

Netizens flooded comment sections:

"Three hundred million on jewelry? Just another Tuesday for a Valdemar wife!"

"That ruby necklace stole my breath!"

"The imperial jade bracelet could buy a skyscraper! Absolute showstopper!"

Jasmine Keane's nails dug into her palms as she scrolled through the frenzy.

Her friends buzzed around her:

"You're so lucky dating a Valdemar heir, Jas!"

"Remember when he gifted you that designer bag? Pocket change compared to this!"

"I'd sell my soul for one of those pieces!"

Jasmine forced a smile. "Don't compare me to Sophia—"

"Why not? You'll be a Valdemar too!"

"Exactly! If she can do it, so can you!"

That evening, curled against Julian Valdemar's chest, Jasmine murmured casually:

"Did you see the news about Sophia's auction today, darling?"
###Chapter 341

"Have you seen the trending news?" Jasmine Keane strode into the living room in stilettos, her phone screen glowing coldly in her grip.

Julian Valdemar was hunched over the coffee table revising his portfolio. The pencil scratched against paper as he worked. "Had three interviews today. Didn't check my phone."

Paint stains dotted the cuffs of his white shirt. His tie hung loosely around his neck. Since leaving the Valdemar estate, the former young master had to iron his own clothes.

"Guess who I saw today?" Jasmine thrust her phone at him. "Sophia Laurent just acquired a Van Gogh 'Sunflowers' replica at the charity gala. The whole internet's praising the Valdemar heiress's exquisite taste."

The pencil tip snapped. Julian stared at his sketch, voice flat. "She represents Valdemar Holdings now. Standard social obligation." He sharpened the pencil. "Stop calling her sister-in-law. I'm no longer part of that family."

Jasmine's manicured fingers clenched.

"You're joking." Her voice spiked before dropping to a hiss. "That's the Valdemar empire! Did your parents approve this?"

"They'd prefer me gone." Julian's lips twisted. "The Patriarch froze my trust fund." His gaze suddenly burned bright. "But I got a callback from miHoYo today. Concept artist position."

Jasmine recoiled as if hearing nonsense.

"Eight thousand during probation. Double after." Julian caught her trembling hand, smearing pencil dust on her fresh manicure. "Enough for a small flat near the Bund."

"Have you lost your mind?" She jerked free. "Eight thousand won't even buy one of your old watch straps!" Her Chanel earrings shimmered violently with each heaving breath.

Julian watched her calmly. Behind him towered stacks of rejected resumes, the top sheet bearing "Shanghai Institute of Visual Arts - Honors Graduate."

"Jasmine." His whisper barely carried. "When Sophia struck me from the family registry, these hands became all I have left."

Her lips trembled. Last month's maxed-out credit card at Plaza 66 flashed through her mind. The walk-up apartment with its broken elevator.

Beyond the window, the neon skyline of Lujiazui glittered like liquid gold. All those once-touchable splendors now mere reflections in glass.
###Chapter 342

Julian Valdemar's face darkened instantly. He remained silent for a long moment before speaking in a hoarse voice.

"They never cared about these things..."

His parents only had eyes for each other. If not for his mother's unexpected pregnancy and fear of harming her health, this celestial couple wouldn't have kept their burden of a child.

Had Patriarch Valdemar not visited by chance, he would have died at the hands of that wicked nanny.

The number of times he'd seen his parents in all these years could be counted on ten fingers.

Jasmine Keane keenly sensed his emotional turmoil and unconsciously softened her voice.

"Don't be sad, Julian. You still have me."

Julian tightened his arms around her, his Adam's apple bobbing. "Mm."

The conversation ended abruptly.

But behind his back, a shadow of gloom flickered across Jasmine's face.

Elsewhere, after being rejected by Sophia Laurent, Ethan Winston tossed and turned before finally knocking on the doors of Valdemar Sanatorium.

"Patriarch Valdemar, you look even healthier than last time."

The Winstons and Valdemars were related by marriage - Ethan's mother and Alexander Valdemar's mother were sisters.

The old patriarch fixed him with piercing eyes. "Get to the point."

Under that gaze, Ethan's palms grew damp with sweat.

"Truthfully, it's about Sophia."

He took a deep breath. "We were in love for three years and about to get engaged when she suddenly married someone else. She must have been coerced by her family."

The patriarch tapped his fingers lightly on the armrest. "Oh?"

"The Lowells always favored their adopted daughter Emily. She was originally the one engaged to Alexander." Ethan spoke hurriedly. "But the moment something happened to him, they pushed Sophia forward as replacement. This is clearly—"

The patriarch suddenly chuckled. "And?"

Ethan was caught off guard. "You...don't mind?"

"Mind what?" The old man narrowed his eyes. "We believe in free love these days. You're the one being old-fashioned."

"But this is deception!" Ethan clenched his fists. "Sophia is a victim too. She never wanted to marry into the Valdemar family!"

The room temperature seemed to plummet.

The patriarch slowly set down his teacup. "What exactly are you trying to say?"

Ethan's back was drenched in sweat, but he persisted. "For my mother's sake, I beg you to let Sophia go."

A soft laugh escaped the old man. "She married into the Valdemars. What business is it of yours?"
###Chapter 343

Ethan Winston froze at Patriarch Valdemar's question.

His Adam's apple bobbed several times before he managed to speak. "There are indeed... some misunderstandings between Sophia and me."

The old man's sharp gaze pinned him down. "I know Sophia well. She's not the type to two-time anyone."

The implication was clear - Ethan was the one causing trouble.

Ethan's face turned deathly pale.

"We shared three years together—"

Patriarch Valdemar cut him off with a raised hand. "Take your feelings to Sophia."

The patriarch took a sip of tea before adding, "Remember - no harassment. If she rejects you, stay away."

His admiration for Sophia was evident.

He'd already considered making her his adopted granddaughter if she couldn't become his daughter-in-law.

"Sophia will always be part of the Valdemar family."

The declaration rang with finality, leaving no doubt about his protection.

Ethan's eyes widened in shock.

He'd assumed Sophia was just a pawn to the Valdemars.

The old man scoffed. "What? Thought I'd discard her after use?"

Ethan hastily lowered his head. "I wouldn't dare presume."

He left with unsteady steps, his mind reeling.

Westmount Villa blazed with lights.

Sophia Laurent returned home under heavy security escort, followed by armored vehicles transporting jewelry.

She nearly collided with Adrian Valdemar in the foyer.

"Quite the entourage," Adrian remarked, eyeing the procession.

Since joining the "Empress" production, his acting had improved dramatically.

Director Lucas Sheridan had progressed from harsh critiques to occasional praise.

Despite the grueling schedule, Adrian seemed more energized than ever.

"Precautions for valuable cargo," Sophia explained calmly.

Adrian nodded in understanding.

Sophia realized with surprise that the once-antagonistic young man hadn't bickered with her in ages.

She couldn't resist teasing him. "No commentary? I just spent three hundred million of the Valdemar fortune today." Her tone deliberately lingered on the sum.
###Chapter 344

Adrian Valdemar shrugged lazily after hearing Sophia Laurent's words.

"Buy whatever you want. It's not my money anyway."

He muttered under his breath, "The Valdemars can certainly afford a few pieces of jewelry."

Sophia arched an eyebrow.

Did he really see her as part of the Valdemar family now?

Adrian was already scheming about how to make Sophia his official sister-in-law.

In the following days, Sophia devoted herself entirely to handling the backlog of projects at Valdemar Holdings.

News of her spending three hundred million on jewelry at the auction spread like wildfire.

Not only did it restore investors' confidence in Valdemar Holdings, but it also elevated Sophia's status in the business world.

Whether she was the Valdemar daughter-in-law or Patriarch Valdemar's pawn, she had become someone to be reckoned with.

At the negotiation table, Sophia effortlessly controlled the pace.

Often, the other party didn't even realize what had happened before the contract was signed.

When faced with unreasonable demands from potential partners, Sophia never backed down.

"Sorry, we don't work with those who lack sincerity."

Even if they tried to compromise at the last minute, she wouldn't reconsider.

"Does Patriarch Valdemar know you operate like this?"

"We've already made concessions!"

Sophia smiled, but her eyes were icy.

"Going back on your word isn't the Valdemar way."

In just two weeks, Sophia made a name for herself in the business world.

Some admired her. Others resented her.

Aside from clearing the project backlog, her most critical task was understanding the Eden Project.

Valdemar Holdings owned an extremely valuable plot of land on the outskirts of the city.

A decade ago, it had been wasteland. Now, it was prime real estate.

Over the years, countless plans had been proposed, but the final decision rested with the shareholders.

Given the massive investment required, majority shareholder support was essential.

This shareholders' meeting would be Sophia's toughest challenge yet.

Despite her recent successes, her lack of experience made it hard to command respect.

Vincent Valdemar was also a shareholder.

By scheduling the meeting while Alexander was hospitalized, he hoped to sway the shareholders to his side.

On the day of the meeting, Sophia arrived in a striking red dress paired with a blazer, radiating authority.

At exactly nine o'clock, the meeting commenced.

Sophia sat at the head of the table, her voice clear and composed.

"Now that everyone is here, let's begin."

"You're all aware of the Eden Project's potential. The surrounding area has developed rapidly over the past two years, and the opportunities are immense. Does anyone have suggestions?"

Before she could finish, someone eagerly jumped in to speak.
###Chapter 345

"The Eden Project's location is prime real estate. Developing luxury residences there would guarantee massive profits."

"Real estate remains the most stable investment."

"The market is too volatile right now. Investing carelessly carries huge risks."

"Ordinary housing may not sell, but high-end mansions will always have buyers."

The boardroom buzzed with debate.

Vincent Valdemar sat in the corner, impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, his gaze never leaving Sophia Laurent.

Sophia silently noted each shareholder's stance.

The argument raged for half an hour.

She remained silent throughout.

Tensions mounted among the board members.

Finally, someone turned on her.

"Madam President, as the leader, shouldn't you voice your position?"

The room fell silent.

All eyes locked onto her.

"During an economic downturn, the wealthy liquidate properties for cash." Sophia's voice was ice-cold. "Entering the market now would be unwise."

Several brows furrowed the moment she finished speaking.

Her words directly contradicted Vincent's proposal.

"Madam President, you're mistaken." Director Granger slammed the table. "Housing is a necessity. People will always buy."

Sophia's cold gaze swept over him. "Have you reviewed the latest market reports, Director Granger? Do you know the vacancy rates in the suburbs?"

Granger faltered.

"The Valdemar Group built its empire on real estate." He quickly recovered. "For our acting president to dismiss it outright—do you have ulterior motives?"

His words ignited the room.

Vincent's supporters emerged one after another.

"The Eden Project is perfect for residential development. Why oppose it?"

Others defended Sophia.

"The president already gave her reasoning. Are you deaf?"

The atmosphere grew increasingly hostile.

"The Valdemars should lead the Valdemar Group!" Someone tore off the facade.

"Letting an outsider play CEO is a joke!"
###Chapter 346

Vincent Valdemar listened to the mocking whispers around him, a knowing smile playing on his lips.

"Sophia is still young and inexperienced. I hope you'll all be understanding..."

Sophia Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the table, a cold glint flashing in her eyes.

These people were clearly Vincent's pawns.

On the surface, they were targeting her, but their real goal was the helm of Valdemar Holdings.

Alexander remained comatose. The Patriarch was frail with age. Adrian was too green.

By every calculation, Vincent stood to benefit the most.

Right on cue, someone spoke up the moment Vincent finished.

"If she's incompetent, she should step aside. The Valdemars aren't lacking in successors."

Sophia lifted her gaze to the speaker. "Who would you suggest, Director Zhu?"

Director Zhu smiled obsequiously. "Vincent Valdemar, of course. Who could be more legitimate?"

The boardroom erupted.

"What are you implying? Sophia was appointed by the Patriarch himself. Are you questioning his judgment?"

Everyone knew the Patriarch's health had declined to the point where Sophia now chaired critical meetings in his stead.

"The Patriarch is elderly. An occasional lapse in judgment is understandable, no?"

Gasps filled the room.

These same directors had groveled before Alexander. Now they dared openly defy the Patriarch to side with Vincent.

The truth dawned on them all.

Today's so-called project review was nothing but a power grab.

"Hand over the company seal, Sophia. HR will process your resignation with all due courtesy."

Sophia turned her calm, unreadable gaze toward Vincent as the directors pressed in.

"Is this your wish as well?"

Vincent beamed. "When the majority speaks, one must answer the call of duty."

Sophia let out a soft laugh. "Have you no shame left in your pursuit of this seat?"

Vincent's face darkened.

"Don't test my patience, Sophia. Surrender the seal and spare us all this unpleasantness."

She closed the file before her. "And if I refuse?"

"Then you'll remain here until you change your mind."

Vincent's eyes turned icy. "No one's coming to rescue you—least of all the Patriarch."

His words ignited fury among the Patriarch's loyalists.

"Vincent Valdemar! Have you no gratitude for the man who raised you?"
###Chapter 347

Vincent Valdemar slammed his hands on the table, eyes blazing with fury.

"Filial gratitude? The old man stripped me of my position at the peak of my career. Is that his idea of parenting?"

"He'd rather hand the company to some greenhorn than trust his own flesh and blood!"

Henry Chamberlain frowned, tapping his fingers lightly on the desk.

"The Valdemar family affairs are none of our concern. As shareholders, we only care about profits. Under Alexander's leadership, company profits grew a hundredfold. That's an indisputable fact."

Several veteran shareholders nodded in agreement.

Vincent sneered, his gaze darkening as it swept across the room.

"Alexander was one thing. But this wet-behind-the-ears woman—what right does she have to sit in the Valdemar CEO's chair?"

Whispers rippled through the boardroom.

Sophia Laurent remained composed in the head seat, her fingertips lightly drumming the armrest.

"You flatter me, Mr. Valdemar. This 'wet-behind-the-ears' woman happens to be the legitimate CEO."

She leaned forward slightly, a sharp glint flashing in her eyes.

"Whereas you, Mr. Valdemar—what do you have besides underhanded tricks?"

Vincent's face turned ashen.

"You should know the consequences of reckless words, Ms. Laurent."

Sophia unhurriedly opened the file before her.

"Do you know why the Patriarch chose Alexander?"

Vincent scoffed.

"Sentimental old fool playing favorites."

A soft laugh escaped Sophia as she pushed the documents forward.

"During your three-year tenure, you spearheaded thirteen projects. Eight incurred losses, three broke even, and only two showed marginal profits."

Her clear voice carried across the room as she surveyed the attendees.

"Those annual dividends came from eating into the company's reserves. Surely you all remember?"

The veteran shareholders exchanged uneasy glances.

Vincent shot to his feet.

"Outrageous lies!"

Henry promptly handed Sophia a stack of reports.

Her finger tapped the data.

"Black and white, Mr. Valdemar. Care to verify?"

A heavy silence fell over the meeting.

One shareholder finally spoke up. "Even so, at least Mr. Valdemar maintained the company's foundation—"

Sophia lifted her gaze, a cold smile playing on her lips.

"Maintenance? Valdemar needs pioneers, not graveyard keepers."
###Chapter 348

Sophia Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the conference table, sliding a stack of documents toward the center.

The board members passed around the detailed financial report, its pages clearly marked with data from Vincent Valdemar's tenure.

Someone gasped audibly.

Vincent shot to his feet, the papers trembling slightly in his grip.

He narrowed his eyes at Sophia.

This little upstart dared to pull such a move.

"I admit my initial inexperience," Vincent suddenly softened his tone. "But I'm not the same man I was years ago—"

His gaze flicked meaningfully toward Sophia.

Whispers rippled through the boardroom.

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

"Shall we review Alexander's first-quarter report instead?"

Her fingertip pressed a button, illuminating the projector screen.

The dancing data curves left everyone breathless.

One board member absently stroked his chin.

Vincent's fists clenched.

"Alexander is lying in a hospital bed!" His voice rose sharply. "Are we really going to let some inexperienced girl—"

He cut himself off, realizing his blunder too late.

Sophia chuckled softly.

"Today's discussion is about the Eden Project." She pushed forward another document. "This proposal bears Alexander's personal signature."

The rustle of turning pages filled the room.

Vincent ground his molars until they ached.

She'd outmaneuvered him again.

Mentioning Alexander had been a mistake.

The old foxes' eyes gleamed with new interest.

Sophia lifted her teacup, her clear eyes visible through the rising steam.

Vincent suddenly met her piercing gaze.
###Chapter 349

Those icy eyes held unmistakable mockery.

Vincent Valdemar's chest tightened. His fingers clenched involuntarily.

Every shareholder's gaze in the boardroom was fixed on him. He had no choice but to suppress his fury.

Alexander's proposal outlined transforming the Eden Project into Asia's largest integrated resort.

The vast suburban expanse was precisely why the land had remained undeveloped for so long.

Watching the shareholders' wavering expressions, Vincent gritted his teeth.

"Gentlemen," his voice rose sharply, "don't forget the dividends I've promised."

He feigned distress, pressing fingers to his temple. "As a father, seeing Alexander hospitalized pains me more than anyone. But Valdemar Group cannot descend into chaos."

"Your livelihoods depend on its stability."

His words had the intended effect. Shareholders lifted their heads attentively.

"As for the Eden Project, we'll revisit it another day."

"Now, I propose revoking Sophia Laurent's authority as acting CEO."

He'd already secured the votes.

The Patriarch had been maneuvered away. By the time he realized what happened, it would be too late.

Then the project's fate would rest solely in Vincent's hands.

Sophia tapped the table lightly with her fingertips.

So this was outright theft.

Her rapport with these old foxes couldn't compare to Vincent's long-standing relationships.

Those supporting her did so out of respect for the Patriarch and Alexander.

Judging by the atmosphere, Vincent must have promised substantial incentives.

Her gaze flickered.

If he was playing dirty, she needn't hold back either.

As long as she refused to surrender the corporate seal, Vincent couldn't touch her.

Once the Patriarch noticed something amiss, he'd intervene.

This realization relaxed Sophia. She leaned back leisurely, surveying the room with an amused half-smile.

That look ignited Vincent's temper.

"Sophia," he snapped, "hand over the seal. Let's keep this civil."

She didn't even bother looking at him.

This was a test of patience now.

Being ignored finally shattered Vincent's composure.

"What's this attitude? I'm your elder!"

The boardroom doors burst open.

A razor-sharp voice cut through the tension:

"So you do remember being an elder?"
###Chapter 350

The deep, icy voice cut through the air like a blade.

Every person in the boardroom stiffened.

Heads turned toward the entrance in unison.

Sophia Laurent sensed the shift in atmosphere instantly.

She turned.

Her breath caught.

A man stood at the doorway, his presence commanding the room.

His chiseled features were sharp, his posture tall and imposing. Dark eyes gleamed with quiet authority.

Alexander Valdemar.

Silence swallowed the boardroom.

Vincent Valdemar's face drained of color.

Memories of being overshadowed by Alexander flooded back.

His fingers trembled against the table.

Alexander had never lifted a finger against him—yet always outshone him effortlessly.

Even shareholders who once supported Vincent had defected to Alexander's side.

And Alexander? He regarded Vincent with nothing but cold indifference.

The worst part? Every decision Alexander opposed had proven correct in the end.

Now, Vincent couldn't even meet his son's piercing gaze.

That sharp stare made his instincts scream at him to flee.

But Alexander didn't spare him a glance.

Henry Chamberlain brought forward a chair. Alexander took his seat beside Sophia.

"Ms. Laurent."

His voice was like winter pine—cool, crisp, with a hint of cedar.

Sophia's pulse quickened, despite her usual composure.

Henry cleared his throat. "Mr. Valdemar is attending as a shareholder. Please proceed with the meeting, Ms. Laurent."

The message was clear: Sophia remained in control.

Yet Alexander's mere presence beside her made the room tense.

Sophia steadied herself. "Any thoughts on the proposal?"

The previously indecisive shareholders fell silent.

Vincent shot a pointed look at one of his allies.

The man swallowed hard. "Ms. Laurent, the Eden Project land would be ideal for luxury villas—"

Alexander's gaze flicked toward him.

The shareholder broke into a cold sweat.

The temperature in the room seemed to plummet.

Vincent's supporters lowered their heads.

An Alexander-aligned shareholder seized the moment. "Ms. Laurent, you believe the amusement park has more potential?"

Sophia nodded smoothly. "Modern families prioritize shared experiences. The theme park market shows consistent growth—"

She outlined Alexander's proposed entertainment complex in detail.

Another shareholder immediately voiced agreement.
###Chapter 351

The conference room was dead silent.

Director Zhang was the first to rise, slamming his documents onto the table. "I support Madam Laurent's decision!" His gaze swept across the room. "Who else shares my view?"

This veteran shareholder had always been Alexander's staunchest ally, previously clashing most fiercely with Vincent's faction.

With someone taking the lead, the situation became crystal clear.

The wavering shareholders had already made up their minds the moment Alexander walked in.

The most uncomfortable were those early investors tied to Vincent's interests. Beads of sweat formed on their foreheads, yet they dared not even breathe loudly.

Their negligible share percentages couldn't possibly sway the outcome.

The game was over.

No one dared mention returning the company seal to Sophia again.

Vincent shoved his chair back violently, sending papers scattering across the floor. He stormed out, slamming the door behind him with a thunderous expression.

Alexander's supporters exhaled in relief, stepping forward to exchange pleasantries.

"Glad to see you've recovered, Mr. Valdemar. We'll take our leave now."

The neutral faction hastily followed suit with their goodbyes.

Alexander remained expressionless, not even bothering to glance their way.

Henry smoothly gestured. "You're dismissed."

Only when the room emptied did Sophia notice her slightly damp palms.

It wasn't nervousness—just discomfort at being alone with Alexander.

She'd heard too many legends about this man's dominance in the business world. At various events where she'd glimpsed him from afar, he'd always been surrounded like the moon among stars.

Now, the crisp scent of pinewood lingered between them.

Sophia pressed her lips together, about to speak—

"Mr. Valdemar—"

"Miss Laurent—"

Their voices overlapped.

Alexander's long fingers flexed against his knees. "You first." His tone remained cool but carried three degrees more warmth than before.

This subtle shift eased Sophia's tension.

"Our engagement was purely accidental." She met his gaze directly. "Now that you're awake, Valdemar Holdings should rightfully return to you."

She paused, her voice steady. "Rest assured, I won't use this to cling to you."

A flicker of surprise crossed Alexander's eyes.

The young woman before him had clear, guileless eyes—startlingly transparent.

He suddenly recalled that press conference where she'd claimed to have admired him for years.

So this was...

The corner of his mouth lifted. What a clever girl.

"I understand." He gave a slight nod.
###Chapter 352

Seeing Sophia's resolute attitude, Alexander knew further persuasion would be futile.

"Ms. Laurent, you've worked hard these past months."

His long fingers tapped the mahogany desk with restrained rhythm.

"Valdemar Group rewards merit. Legal will draft the agreement—state your terms."

He paused, the words "terminating our engagement" poised on his lips when the conference door burst open.

"Mr. Valdemar!"

Henry Chamberlain rushed in, beads of sweat glistening on his forehead.

His gaze flickered to Sophia for a fleeting second before darting away.

Alexander's brow furrowed.

"Excuse us." He turned to Sophia. "Five minutes?"

She noted Henry's agitation.

Smoothing her skirt, she rose.

"I'll wait in your office."

The conference room felt stifling. She needed air.

Alexander watched her leave before addressing Henry.

"Report."

Henry inhaled sharply.

"We found Tiffany Morrison."

Alexander's fingers clenched.

"Arrange the meeting."

That hazy night flashed through his mind—the girl hadn't resisted.

Dawn had forced his departure, leaving only his card and Patek Philippe behind.

Yet she'd never contacted him.

The erased security footage had made the search excruciating.

Henry hesitated.

"Sir..."

He extended a dossier.

"Our investigation confirms Tiffany Morrison is Ms. Laurent."

Alexander's pupils contracted.

"Repeat that."
###Chapter 353

"We've verified the identities of all female guests at the hotel that night." Henry Chamberlain placed the investigation report on the desk. "Although the hotel surveillance was deleted, cross-referencing surrounding cameras and the banquet guest list confirmed Tiffany Morrison's true identity."

Tiffany Morrison...

Alexander Valdemar stared at the report, his fingers absently tapping the desk.

The office fell into silence.

Recognizing the CEO's unreadable expression, Henry quietly excused himself.

Pearl Group CEO's Office.

Sophia Laurent lounged in an armchair by the floor-to-ceiling window. Sunlight streamed through the glass, gilding her hair with gold.

Her workload had decreased significantly since Alexander woke up.

Oliver Granger handled Pearl Group's daily operations, leaving Sophia to focus on major decisions. The Versini Couture design competition was her only recent public appearance.

The thought of upcoming leisure time made her lips curve unconsciously.

The office door opened.

Alexander stood at the threshold, his gaze settling on the sunlit woman. She squinted slightly like a contented cat, bathed in a soft glow.

"Sorry to keep you waiting." He approached quietly.

Sophia turned with an unchanged smile. "No problem."

She waited for him to continue.

Several seconds of silence passed.

"Ms. Laurent." Alexander sat across from her, his voice low. "I need your help with something."

Sophia arched a brow. "Oh?"

"Valdemar Group is currently unstable." His expression remained neutral. "Our recent public appearance as a couple means divorcing now would affect stock prices."

Her brows furrowed slightly.

He'd agreed readily during their meeting.

"Mr. Valdemar means...?" She kept her tone even.

"Maintaining the marriage." Alexander met her gaze directly. "One hundred million per year. Pearl Group becomes Valdemar's preferred partner. I won't interfere in your life—strictly business."

He stated it clinically, as if negotiating a routine deal.

Only he knew his palms had grown damp.

Sophia swallowed her immediate refusal.

The offer was too tempting.

She studied the man opposite her—immaculate suit, impassive demeanor, not a single crack in his composure.
###Chapter 354

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly as she processed Alexander's offer.

The nine-figure annual salary burned in her palm.

Even hotter was the preferential partnership agreement—a golden ticket to elevate Pearl Entertainment into the elite circle.

Alexander tapped the mahogany desk with his manicured fingers. "Have you made your decision, Ms. Laurent?"

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, making her squint.

The memory of last night's positive pregnancy test flashed before her eyes.

"I apologize." She slid the contract back. "I have personal commitments."

His fountain pen left an ink blot on the document.

"Three months." His voice turned razor-sharp. "That's all I need."

Her head snapped up.

Dark currents swirled in his gaze. "Valdemar Holdings requires this marriage to stabilize our stocks."

Her fists clenched the silk folds of her skirt.

"The Patriarch just had a stent procedure." Alexander's tone darkened. "Another boardroom coup would kill him."

Sophia bit her lower lip.

Security footage from that hotel corridor resurfaced in her mind.

"Name your price." He flipped open a dossier. "The South District land parcel."

Her breath hitched.

The project her dying father had obsessed over.

"Why me?"

His cufflinks glinted coldly. "The Patriarch approves of you."

Helicopter blades thundered outside.

This morning's nausea rose in her throat again.

"I need time."

"Tomorrow at ten." Alexander stood, his cedarwood cologne enveloping her. "City Hall."

His assistant entered abruptly. "Mr. Valdemar, the sanatorium is calling."

Sophia watched his jawline tighten.

"The Patriarch demands to meet his granddaughter-in-law." Alexander adjusted her scarf. "Immediately."

Her hand drifted to her abdomen as she rose.

In the descending elevator, he dropped another bombshell. "Adrian returned."

The mirrored walls reflected her sudden pallor.

"Family dinner tonight." He secured her coat collar. "Play your role well."

White magnolia petals dusted their shoulders at the sanatorium entrance.

The sound of shattering porcelain echoed from the private suite.

"That actress belongs in a ditch, not our family tomb!" The Patriarch's roar vibrated the doorframe.

Alexander's palm pressed between her shoulder blades.

Heat seared through the fabric.

"Steady." His breath grazed her ear. "I'm here."

Sophia stared at his Adam's apple, so close she could trace its contour.

Just like that voice in the darkness had promised.
###Chapter 355

The shareholders who had been so arrogant moments ago fell silent the instant Alexander Valdemar entered the room. Sophia Laurent observed their reaction with narrowed eyes. This wasn't mere fear.

"My apologies, but... I have my reasons."

Sophia's slender fingers tapped lightly against the desk as she firmly rejected Alexander's proposal. She paused. "However, I can promise to keep the divorce confidential. Would that suffice?"

Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line.

The air grew heavy with tension.

"Very well. As you wish." His deep voice finally conceded defeat.

Sophia's refusal had been too decisive to argue with.

"Legal will draft the agreement promptly. Should you have additional requests, don't hesitate to voice them." Alexander retrieved his phone. "Shall we exchange contact information?"

This time, Sophia didn't decline.

She unlocked her screen, and they added each other on WeChat.

"Mr. Valdemar, regarding the arranged marriage..." Her words trailed off.

Alexander lowered his lashes. "I understand."

Further insistence would only make him seem desperate.

That night's incident wasn't worth mentioning either.

If she refused even a marriage in name only, she certainly didn't want his responsibility.

He'd simply increase the compensation in the agreement.

"Though our collaboration fell through, my earlier promise stands."

Alexander suddenly lifted his gaze, eyes burning with intensity. "Pearl Entertainment will always be Valdemar Holdings' preferred partner."

Sophia's eyes widened.

What... did that mean?

She'd rejected him, yet he was offering such an enormous concession?

The man before her was so strikingly handsome it seemed unreal. For a fleeting moment, she lost herself in his presence.

"Thank you, Mr. Valdemar." She finally found her voice.

No one would refuse such an olive branch.

Not even her.

"Should you ever need anything, don't hesitate to contact me."

Sophia added, her fingers unconsciously tracing the rim of her teacup.

"Aside from the arranged marriage, I'll assist however I can."

Seeing the earnest expression on the young woman's face, Alexander's gloom dissipated. The corners of his lips lifted. "Then I'll thank you in advance, Miss Laurent."

When he smiled, he seemed bathed in golden light.

Sophia stared, momentarily transfixed.

It took her several seconds to avert her gaze. "You're welcome."

Noticing her flustered reaction, Alexander arched an eyebrow.

Silence stretched between them.

"I should go." Sophia abruptly stood, the tips of her ears turning pink.

How embarrassing—to be so distracted by a mere smile!

Alexander rose as well. "Allow me to escort you."

"That won't be necessary." Sophia waved him off. "You've just returned to the office. You must be busy."

She didn't want to owe him any more favors.

"I'm not." Alexander insisted, already reaching for his suit jacket.
###Chapter 356

Sophia Laurent studied Alexander Valdemar's resolute expression before finally nodding in agreement.

After all, Pearl Entertainment was about to enter a deep collaboration with Valdemar Holdings.

An opportunity to connect with a business legend like Alexander was something most could only dream of.

Once inside the car, Sophia realized returning to Westmount Villa now would be inappropriate.

"Please take me to Pearl Entertainment," she said softly.

Alexander gave a slight nod. "See you tonight."

His warm, cultured voice sent an unexpected flutter through Sophia's chest. "Alright," she murmured in response.

Her steps were quicker than usual as she exited the vehicle.

She pressed a hand to her chest, feeling the strange rhythm beneath her fingers.

Rumors painted the Valdemar patriarch as ruthless and merciless—a man who struck fear into hearts.

Yet the refined gentleman before her bore no resemblance to those chilling tales.

As the limousine pulled away, the atmosphere inside turned icy.

Henry Chamberlain tightened his grip on the steering wheel. "Back to the office, Mr. Valdemar?"

Alexander closed his eyes. "Mm."

A faint smile played on Henry's lips, excitement flashing in his eyes.

The old foxes hiding in the shadows would finally show their tails today.

Sophia's office floor had been rented during Pearl Entertainment's early days.

She'd purchased the entire level as her company flourished.

The space included a private restroom where she often spent nights.

Her hand drifted to her abdomen. It was time to consider buying property.

After reviewing documents, she instructed Oliver Granger to scout suitable residences.

Golden sunlight streamed through the windows as Sophia awoke from her nap.

The fiery sunset painted the sky, lifting her spirits.

Her phone rang—Alexander's call.

"Ms. Laurent, are you finished for the day?"

Sophia suddenly remembered their dinner plans. "Just send me the address."

A pause. "Grandfather asked me to pick you up."

"What?" Surprise colored her voice. "Should I meet you at Valdemar Holdings?"

"I'm already downstairs." His tone remained warm and clear.

Sophia's lips curved upward unbidden. "I'll be right there."

The world's perception of Alexander Valdemar was utterly absurd.

She changed into a moon-white dress and flats before hurrying downstairs.

When she tapped on the car window, Alexander turned.

Sunset gilded the young woman in golden light as she stood there, eyes sparkling with quiet amusement.
###Chapter 357

The car door clicked softly, snapping Alexander out of his thoughts. He reached over and pulled it open.

Sophia bent to slide into the seat, her voice cool. "Mr. Valdemar."

Her tone was polite yet distant, as if addressing a stranger.

Alexander gave a curt nod. "Ms. Laurent."

A day of meetings had clarified their current relationship.

The accident was indeed his fault.

If she wanted no further entanglement, he would compensate her in other ways.

As for tonight's family dinner—that was entirely the Patriarch's idea.

The old man clearly adored her.

Sophia wasn't surprised by Alexander's aloofness.

They were from different worlds.

Silence settled in the car, broken only by the hum of the engine.

An hour later, the vehicle glided into the Valdemar Manor.

The Valdemars originated from the south, having sacrificed their fortune to support the war effort before rebuilding their empire through shrewd investments.

Now their influence spanned politics and business.

The manor sprawled across lush grounds, blending classical elegance with modern luxury.

Priceless flora adorned the rock gardens and water features, every detail whispering of old money.

Sophia followed Alexander into the grand hall.

The Patriarch was instructing the butler but brightened instantly at her arrival.

"Sophia, my dear! Come sit—"

A genuine smile touched her lips. "Grandfather."

They fell into easy conversation.

Alexander stood forgotten, shaking his head wryly.

A hand clapped his shoulder.

"Tsk tsk." Adrian sidled up, grinning. "How does it feel to be dethroned, brother?"

Alexander's expression frosted over. He shrugged off the contact. "Piss off."

Adrian chuckled. "I know exactly what you're going through—"

He heaved a dramatic sigh. "Ignored by Grandfather, abandoned by your wife—"

Alexander stared flatly.

"Six months' allowance. Gone."

Adrian's eyes bulged. "What? You're cutting a whole year's stipend?"

Alexander ignored him.

"Brother! Blood brother! I was joking!" Adrian hopped in agitation. "Half a year is too harsh!"

Alexander remained unmoved.

Adrian's eyes lit with sudden inspiration. "What if I spy for you?"

He dropped his voice. "I'll watch over Sophia. Any suitors get too close, I'll handle them."

Alexander scoffed. "Pathetic."

"Come on, a woman like her must have admirers." Adrian eyed Alexander critically. "You're decent-looking, but—"

"We're getting divorced," Alexander cut in coldly.
###Chapter 358

Adrian Valdemar was chattering nonstop when Alexander's sudden words froze him in place.

His eyes widened in disbelief.

"Brother, have you lost your mind?"

Adrian's voice rose sharply, drawing curious glances from the surrounding staff.

Alexander gave him an icy look. "We were never close."

The coldness in his gaze sent a chill down Adrian's spine.

Spotting Sophia Laurent chatting cheerfully with Patriarch Valdemar, Adrian quickly dragged Alexander into a corner.

"Brother, where else would you find a woman like Sophia?"

Adrian scratched his head anxiously. "She's done so much for the Valdemar family. How can you just divorce her like this?"

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly, irritation flashing in his eyes.

"She initiated it."

This marriage had indeed brought him considerable convenience.

At least Matriarch Valdemar had stopped pestering him about arranged marriages.

Though sudden divorce might invite gossip, he couldn't care less.

"What? Sophia wants out?"

Adrian's expression collapsed instantly.

Leaning closer, he whispered urgently, "Brother, tell me the truth. Is it because of your injury..."

Alexander's glare could freeze hell.

"Or... have you always been... incapable?"

"Looking to die?"

Alexander's eyes turned murderous.

Adrian shrank back, realizing his mistake.

He grabbed Alexander's arm as he turned to leave. "Brother, feelings can develop over time!"

Alexander paused momentarily.

Seizing the opportunity, Adrian pressed on. "Sophia has both talent and beauty. You two are perfect for each other!"

"Since you're already married, can't you at least try?"

Alexander shook him off and walked away without another word.

Adrian stomped his foot in frustration.

He'd already claimed Sophia as his sister-in-law.

He had to find a way to bring them together.

Meanwhile, Patriarch Valdemar was engaged in casual conversation with Sophia.

"We owe you so much this time."

The old man's face radiated warmth.

Sophia smiled gently. "It was my duty."

Having married into the Valdemar family, these responsibilities came naturally.

The Patriarch's approval grew with each passing moment.

Noticing the brothers' interaction in the distance, he abruptly changed topics.

"Sophia, what do you think of Alexander?"

Sophia blinked in surprise.

She offered a polite smile. "Mr. Valdemar is exceptionally capable and conducts himself with perfect decorum..."

As she continued listing compliments, the Patriarch's smile gradually stiffened.

Though every word was positive, something felt distinctly... off.
###Chapter 359

"If you think he's good, then I'm relieved." Patriarch Valdemar's gaze was earnest. "If he dares to mistreat you, I'll be the first to make him pay."

Sophia Laurent pressed her lips together under the old man's expectant stare.

She decided silently that Alexander should be the one to break the news of their impending divorce.

After all, it was a Valdemar family matter.

Alexander and Adrian Valdemar chose that moment to enter.

Adrian's eyes flickered at his grandfather's words.

"Old man, sis, Mrs. Liu says dinner's ready," he interjected with forced cheer.

Patriarch Valdemar shot him a glare before turning to Sophia with grandfatherly warmth. "Come, Sophia. The kitchen prepared all your favorites tonight."

She offered a faint smile. "Perfect timing. I'm starving."

As the four took their seats, a razor-sharp voice sliced through the dining room.

"Family dinners now exclude me without notice?"

Adrian's smile froze.

His spine straightened, expression turning guarded.

Alexander remained impassive.

Patriarch Valdemar didn't look up. "Just an informal meal."

Sophia glanced toward the doorway.

Vincent Valdemar stood beside a stern-faced matriarch.

The elderly woman wore an onyx qipao with a snow-white shawl, her silver hair coiled in flawless order.

Fury burned in her hawkish eyes.

"Have you all forgotten your place?"

"Sit down or leave," Patriarch Valdemar said coldly.

"You—!"

Matriarch Valdemar's chest heaved with indignation.

Her withering gaze swept the table before landing on Alexander.

"Alexander! That spectacle at headquarters today—were you trying to destroy your own father?"

"Filial piety comes first. Is this how you honor your family?"

Patriarch Valdemar slammed the table. "Mind your tongue, Li Hongying!"

The matriarch sneered. "Did I misspeak? What son treats his father this way?"

Adrian's knuckles whitened around his chopsticks.

Terrified of his grandmother, he stayed silent.

Sophia frowned but held her tongue.

Patriarch Valdemar roared, "And what father deserves this less?"

Matriarch Valdemar scoffed. "Men of our standing have always kept concubines."

"Diana was the one who chose hysterics over dignity, disrupting this household—"

The patriarch choked on his rage.

Alexander spoke at last.
###Chapter 360

Alexander's slender fingers tapped rhythmically against the mahogany desk. His voice carried the chill of winter. "The company has its rules."

His deep-set eyes remained impassive, as though discussing trivial corporate matters.

Matriarch Valdemar clenched her prayer beads, knuckles whitening. Her grandson had struck like lightning today—purging all of Vincent's loyalists and handing their embezzlement evidence to the authorities. The Valdemar Group now trembled under his iron grip.

Those once-aligned executives groveled at the manor gates. With the Patriarch refusing audiences, they begged the Matriarch instead.

Watching her ruthless grandson, conflicting emotions warred within her.

Pride swelled at his leadership. Fury simmered at his mercilessness.

"Alexander," she softened her tone, "he's still your father. Leave some room for reconciliation. Don't make our family a laughingstock."

Adrian shrank into the sofa corner, pretending fascination with the coffee table's intricate carvings.

The Matriarch's gaze still found him.

"Adrian, persuade your brother. Sever all ties, and you sever future roads. You both owe your lives to Vincent. This generational feud isn't yours to settle—certainly not with company assets."

Meeting her veiled threat, Adrian forced a stiff smile.

"Grandmother, I can't even read financial reports. How could I meddle?"

Childhood memories surfaced—Alexander surrounded by tutors mastering finance and languages while he scavenged for meals, invisible even to servants.

Back in the manor, his mother Diana had alternated between violent outbursts and tearful embraces after his birth. Young Adrian would cower like a frightened animal, earning the Matriarch's perpetual disdain.

Whenever displeased, the Matriarch tormented Diana. Adrian often knelt for hours in the ancestral hall or went hungry.

Now she threatened Diana again. A single "visit" to Tranquil Heights Sanatorium could destabilize his mother's fragile recovery.

He'd yielded before when clashing with Sebastian. But this involved corporate survival—those leeches had sabotaged Alexander while lining their pockets. Pleading for them would be idiocy.

The Matriarch's glare sharpened before shifting to Alexander.

"Those are veteran executives! Dismiss them if you must, but must you destroy them completely?"

Alexander remained unmoved, not even blinking.

The Patriarch suddenly interjected, "Stay out of company affairs! They dug their own graves."

Frustrated by Alexander's indifference, the Matriarch slammed the table. "They bled for Valdemar! Is this how you repay loyalty?"
###Chapter 361

The crystal chandelier in Valdemar Manor cast dazzling reflections across the room.

Sophia Laurent stirred her soup absently, watching her faint frown ripple across the surface. The tension at the dining table was thicker than she'd anticipated.

Matriarch Valdemar's well-manicured fingers clenched her napkin, knuckles turning white. "Alexander, those are your uncles and cousins."

Patriarch Valdemar slammed his chopsticks down with a sharp clatter. "Uncles? Did they remember their family ties when they conspired to undermine Alexander?"

Alexander Valdemar traced the rim of his wineglass with elegant fingers, his gaze icy.

The Matriarch stiffened, clearly unprepared for such public humiliation from her husband.

"The dividends they receive could sustain three generations," the Patriarch boomed. "Yet their greed knows no bounds—even tampering with bids."

Sophia's spoon accidentally tapped against her bowl with a delicate chime.

The Matriarch suddenly turned on her. "So this is the healing marriage girl?"

Alexander's eyes turned lethal. He handed Sophia a napkin with the same precision as signing a multimillion-dollar contract.

"My wife, Sophia Laurent." His measured tone made the Matriarch blanch.

The older woman forced a smile. "If we're family, Alexander should show mercy."

"Certainly." Alexander's lips curled sardonically. "Once they return every cent they stole."

The Matriarch shot up, her chair screeching across the floor. "You'd drive them to ruin!"

Adrian Valdemar stifled a laugh until the Patriarch silenced him with a glare.

Sophia sipped her soup quietly, finding this power struggle far more riveting than expected.

Alexander methodically cut his steak. "Repayment or prison. Their choice."

The chandelier's glow sharpened the angles of his profile, casting stark shadows.

The Matriarch's chest heaved, her carefully styled curls coming undone. Snatching her purse, she stormed out without a backward glance.

The Patriarch sighed. "Another ruined meal."

Sophia exhaled discreetly as the Matriarch disappeared. When she turned, Alexander's dark gaze met hers.

His long fingers tapped her bowl lightly. "Keep eating."

Only the quiet clink of silverware remained. Sophia suddenly understood—the waters of this elite family ran far deeper than she'd imagined.
###Chapter 362

Alexander's words formed an impenetrable wall, blocking all of Matriarch Valdemar's schemes.

Sophia Laurent felt warmth bloom in her chest at his silent protection.

The Matriarch's brows furrowed tightly.

She had originally selected a suitable bride from an equally prestigious family for Alexander.

A minor family like the Lowells was beneath her notice.

Who could have predicted Alexander's sudden accident, allowing the Patriarch to push through this marriage?

She had planned to dissolve the engagement under the guise of the healing marriage tradition.

Yet before she could even begin, Alexander had rendered her speechless.

The Matriarch's chest tightened, her blood pressure spiking.

"Old man, Alexander's marriage concerns the future of the Valdemar family. This isn't a game."

The Patriarch scoffed. "I'll naturally arrange a proper wedding for them."

The Matriarch stamped her foot in frustration.

That wasn't what she meant at all.

Seeing the identical stubborn expressions on her husband and grandson's faces, she grew dizzy with rage.

Vincent Valdemar hurried forward to steady her.

"Mother, calm down—"

He turned to glare at Alexander.

"Have you forgotten how to respect your elders?"

"Who doted on you most when you were a child?"

Alexander had been born during his parents' happiest period, and the Matriarch had indeed spoiled him rotten.

Noticing Alexander's slight hesitation, Vincent pressed his advantage.

"Your grandmother only has two wishes. Can't you grant her at least one?"

Whether releasing Sophia or marrying someone else, either outcome would serve their purpose.

The Matriarch nodded approvingly. "One should repay kindness with gratitude."

Adrian Valdemar clenched his fists, barely containing his anger.

Sophia lowered her head to hide her amusement.

Who still played the guilt-tripping card in this day and age?

The Patriarch's expression darkened. "Are you threatening Alexander now?"

The Matriarch glared. "We only want what's best for him!"

"Stop being unreasonable."

The Patriarch slammed the table. "Leave if you've lost your appetite."

"You—" The Matriarch clutched her chest, wounded. "After decades of marriage, this is how you treat me?"

The Patriarch exhaled heavily.

The air froze instantly.

Sophia stole a glance at Alexander.

His expression remained indifferent as he tapped the table lightly. "What would Grandmother have me do?"

Vincent and the Matriarch's eyes lit up with triumph.
###Chapter 363

The melancholy in her eyes vanished, replaced by a spark of eager anticipation.

"Natalie grew up with you. She's beautiful, elegant, and gentle. A top graduate from a prestigious university. A girl like her is hard to come by..."

Natalie Lockwood was a distant relative from Matriarch Valdemar's maternal family, though not related by blood. In the old woman's eyes, she was the perfect candidate for a granddaughter-in-law.

Alexander Valdemar met his grandmother's expectant gaze calmly.

"Are you suggesting I break my childhood engagement and marry someone else?"

"Become a heartless scoundrel and tarnish Grandfather's reputation?"

The smile froze on the Matriarch's face.

It took her a moment to recover. She stammered, "I... I didn't mean it that way..."

Avoiding his eyes, she turned her attention to Sophia Laurent, who was quietly enjoying her spare ribs. Her tone sharpened.

"Miss Laurent, since this marriage wasn't your choice, name your price to dissolve the engagement."

Sophia lifted her head slowly, meeting the Matriarch's condescending stare. A playful glint appeared in her eyes.

She blinked, adopting a pitiful expression. Her voice softened like cotton candy.

"Grandmother, Alexander and I are truly in love."

"I don't want money. I only want him..."

The Matriarch gasped, her finger trembling as she pointed at Sophia. "You!"

Having lived decades, she despised women who put on such theatrics.

Adrian Valdemar, who had been scowling, swallowed his words when Sophia suddenly transformed into a drama queen.

Watching his grandmother's flustered expression, he nearly burst out laughing.

Even Alexander raised an eyebrow, his lips twitching upward.

The Matriarch's face turned livid.

"Stop your acting! I've seen plenty of women like you!"

Sophia bit her lip, appearing frightened into silence.

Her eyes were still red from the spicy chicken earlier, making her look especially wronged.

Alexander intervened coldly, "Enough."

His voice was icy. "Grandmother, Sophia is my wife."

"It's my duty to protect her from disrespect."

"Who's disrespecting her?" The Matriarch slammed the table. "Can't I speak the truth?"

She turned to Patriarch Valdemar. "This woman is faking her innocence! You're all being fooled!"

The Patriarch said sternly, "Sophia is our acknowledged granddaughter-in-law. Don't harass the child."

The Matriarch stamped her foot in frustration.

Adrian struggled to contain his laughter before offering with mock sincerity,

"Don't be upset, Grandmother."

"Alexander is already married, but the Valdemar family still has other eligible..."
###Chapter 364

Adrian Valdemar cast a casual glance at Vincent Valdemar, his lips curling into a faint smirk.

"There's an old saying—better tear down ten temples than ruin one marriage."

"If Grandmother insists on the Lockwood alliance, there's always a solution."

"Natalie doesn't have to marry Alexander. Father has another son, doesn't he?"

The implication was clear—Natalie could marry Sebastian instead.

Matriarch Valdemar's face turned ashen.

She shot Adrian a venomous look. "Children should be seen, not heard."

With Alexander controlling Valdemar Holdings, the Lockwoods needed his influence to maintain their status.

What future would Natalie have with Sebastian?

Vincent glared at his younger son.

Adrian knew better than to disrespect the matriarch, but he had no such reservations with his father.

Meeting Vincent's furious gaze, he didn't bother hiding his derision.

Vincent's face purpled with rage.

Matriarch Valdemar's irritation grew as she took in Sophia Laurent's delicate demeanor. Both Alexander and Patriarch Valdemar were utterly charmed by this woman.

For now, she'd focus on protecting her family's interests.

"Alexander," she softened her tone, "since you're satisfied with this marriage, we'll say no more about Natalie..."

"But could you show some leniency toward the Lockwoods?"

Alexander's gaze darkened, his voice measured.

"You're asking the wrong person. The judicial authorities are handling their case—not me."

The matriarch hadn't expected such resistance.

Without his evidence, would they even be in this situation?

"Alexander, I'm your grandmother!"

He met her gaze calmly. "No one disputes that."

When persuasion failed, she turned to Patriarch Valdemar.

"Victor Valdemar, are you really going to humiliate me like this?"

The patriarch frowned. "Who's humiliating anyone?"

"I've stood by you since I was eighteen. After decades of devotion, is this how you treat my family?"

Her twisted logic provoked him.

"Be reasonable. They brought this on themselves by targeting Alexander first."

He approved of his grandson's uncompromising stance.

Half measures only invited retaliation.

"Nobody would've touched them if they'd behaved."

Cornered, the matriarch resorted to emotional blackmail.

"Then I'm asking you—as your wife—to spare them."

The patriarch's frown deepened.

"What are you implying?"

Her expression turned stony. "Call off Alexander's investigation, or our marriage is over."

The patriarch stared in disbelief.

"You'd divorce me over this?"

"Try me," she snapped.

A mirthless laugh escaped him.

"Have it your way."
###Chapter 365

The Patriarch Valdemar stared coldly at Matriarch Valdemar.

"If you treat marriage as a bargaining chip and value decades of love less than those so-called family members, then divorce is indeed the best choice."

Matriarch Valdemar trembled, her eyes widening in disbelief.

This man, who had once been madly in love with her, now wanted a divorce?

She shook with rage.

"Fine! Let's divorce! I'd like to see who ends up humiliated!"

Failing to achieve her goal, Matriarch Valdemar turned and stormed away.

Before leaving, she shot Sophia Laurent a venomous glare.

If it weren't for this woman—if Natalie Lockwood had married Alexander Valdemar—things wouldn't have come to this!

Sophia was baffled by the hostility.

Just as she frowned in confusion, a steaming bowl of chicken soup was placed before her.

"Ignore her."

The rich aroma of the soup, simmered since afternoon in the Valdemar kitchen, filled the air.

Sophia had noticed it earlier but hadn't dared to move during the tense atmosphere.

She hadn't expected Alexander to serve her.

"Thank you."

She took a sip, savoring the delicious flavor.

Seeing her distracted, Alexander exhaled quietly in relief.

If not for him, Sophia wouldn't have been subjected to such unwarranted hostility tonight.

Patriarch Valdemar sat in silence, his expression dark.

Alexander pressed his lips together, unsure how to comfort him.

The Patriarch and Matriarch had once defied their families for love.

Their bond had been strong—until Vincent Valdemar's infidelity and Diana Valdemar's breakdown.

The Patriarch believed Vincent was unworthy as a husband.

But the Matriarch favored her eldest son, insisting powerful men naturally had multiple women.

She blamed Diana for overreacting and driving Vincent away.

Over time, their rift deepened.

The Matriarch moved in with Vincent's family, growing increasingly biased—even in business matters favoring him.

As the Patriarch wallowed in sorrow, Adrian Valdemar suddenly spoke.

"Old man, don't you think Natalie Lockwood wanting to marry my brother is like a toad lusting after swan meat?"

The Patriarch frowned at him.

Adrian grinned.

"What I mean is, she's not even fit to compare to a single strand of my sister-in-law's hair..."

The Patriarch chuckled despite himself.

"You rascal..."

Adrian had been the one to provoke the Matriarch into leaving earlier.

But her schemes, years in the making, wouldn't end so easily.

Thankfully, he'd ensured Alexander and Sophia's marriage, cutting off the Matriarch's plans.

If their union had faltered, she would have intervened immediately.
###Chapter 366

Patriarch Valdemar massaged his temples.

Decades of marital bonds weren't easily severed.

But Matriarch Valdemar's increasingly outrageous behavior in recent years had pushed him past his limit.

He sighed deeply before turning to Sophia Laurent with a grandfatherly smile.

"Sophia, have some more dishes. I've had the guest room prepared—you're staying tonight."

Sophia choked on her soup, cheeks flushing.

"That... wouldn't be appropriate."

Adrian Valdemar cut in with a meaningful grin. "Why not? Consider this your home, sis."

He winked. "It's settled then!"

Sophia's gaze instinctively sought Alexander Valdemar.

The man avoided her eyes, addressing his grandfather instead. "I have documents to review at the office tonight."

Disappointment flickered across the Patriarch's face, but he didn't insist.

Adrian snorted under his breath.

Coward!

Alexander's sharp glance sent him ducking back into his meal, though his mind reeled.

When had his brother become so spineless?

Too afraid to even suggest she stay.

Then again—they were getting divorced.

——

In the study, Patriarch Valdemar beamed.

"The company crisis is resolved, you and Sophia get along well... This old man can finally rest easy—"

Alexander cut straight to the point. "We're divorcing."

"What?" The Patriarch's head snapped up. "You don't care for her?"

"No." Alexander remained composed. "She's remarkable. But we're incompatible."

Silence stretched between them.

"A divorce now would destabilize the company," the old man finally said.

"I know." Alexander's gaze never wavered. "But that's no reason to trap her."

A pause. "I'll handle the fallout."

The Patriarch waved a weary hand. "Do as you will."

He'd genuinely grown fond of his granddaughter-in-law.

"Don't shortchange her in the settlement."

Alexander nodded solemnly.

Their conversation turned to business matters.

——

Downstairs, Sophia nibbled on fruit in the parlor.

Adrian slumped beside her with a dramatic sigh.

"What did my brother do to upset you?"

Sophia's hand stilled around a grape.

"Why would I be angry with him?"
###Chapter 367

Adrian Valdemar's brows knitted together.

"If you have no objections, why get divorced?"

He ran a frustrated hand through his hair. "My brother has looks, talent—he used to be the most sought-after bachelor in the capital..."

Sophia Laurent burst into laughter.

"What's so funny?"

Adrian met her amused gaze, his ears turning pink.

"Maybe...give him a chance?"

He leaned in eagerly. "Feelings can grow over time."

Sophia arched a brow. "Who was it that swore he'd never accept me as his sister-in-law?"

Hadn't it only been a short while?

Adrian flushed crimson.

"I—I was immature back then."

His expression turned uncharacteristically serious. "I genuinely want you to stay in our family now."

After spending time with her, he'd realized Sophia's cold exterior hid warmth.

And though Alexander was reserved, his behavior toward her was different.

There might still be hope.

Sophia's smile faded as she shook her head.

"I'm sorry. Your brother and I...it's impossible."

Her hand rested lightly on her abdomen, resolve shining in her eyes.

Adrian froze, shoulders slumping.

"Alright."

He didn't press further.

Thirty minutes later, Alexander emerged from the study.

Patriarch Valdemar hesitated before speaking to Sophia.

"Come visit this old man more often."

Understanding his unspoken concern, she nodded warmly.

"Of course."

The Valdemar brothers escorted her home.

"Address?" Alexander asked.

"Pearl Entertainment."

Adrian immediately objected. "You can't go back alone at this hour!"

"I live at the company," Sophia explained.

His eyes widened. "You're not returning to the Lowells?"

She averted her gaze. "It's more convenient for work."

Alexander spoke abruptly. "Go to Westmount Villa."

His voice was calm. "I'll take you to work tomorrow morning."

Adrian nodded vigorously. "Exactly! All your things are still there—"

Sophia turned to Alexander.

The man's dark eyes were inscrutable.
###Chapter 368

Alexander's gaze was unfathomable, like still waters of a deep pool.

Sophia's lashes fluttered slightly as she nodded in agreement.

It was just one night at Westmount Villa.

She trusted his integrity.

His restrained behavior throughout the day proved he harbored no improper intentions.

The guest room bed was luxuriously soft. She slept soundly without dreams.

In the upscale apartment near Versini Couture, a light burned until dawn.

Daniel stared at his computer screen, his stylus tracing over the digital canvas repeatedly.

The neckline embroidery lacked refinement.

The cuff detailing needed adjustment.

Every element had to be flawless.

Tomorrow was the Starlight Design Awards—his best chance to shine.

Finally satisfied with the design, he picked up his phone and opened the long-dormant chat thread.

Their last exchange was a week ago.

Further up, vibrant conversations from two months prior.

Gavin had once mentored him generously.

But somewhere along the way, the senior designer's warmth had vanished.

Now even their office encounters carried an icy distance.

Daniel pressed his lips together and sent the finalized design.

[Mr. Winslow, please review my competition entry.]

No response came.

The light in his eyes dimmed.

The Cunningham residence blazed with light.

Gabrielle clung to Isabella's arm excitedly.

"Once I start at Versini Couture, my first paycheck is all yours for a gift!"

Despite her fashion degree, she'd failed the preliminary screening.

That night, she'd sobbed under her covers, confiding only in Isabella overseas.

To her surprise, Isabella promised immediate placement.

The Cunningham Group supplied fabrics to Versini Couture.

Pulling strings to insert an intern was child's play.

Isabella forced a smile at the younger girl's enthusiasm.

"Don't mention it," she murmured.

Her reflection in the floor-to-ceiling window revealed shadowed eyes.
###Chapter 369

"Even if I can't become your sister-in-law, our childhood friendship won't change..."

Before Isabella Evans could finish, Gabrielle Winston slammed the table and stood abruptly.

"What nonsense are you saying, Isabella?" Her voice dripped with venom. "You're the only woman worthy of my brother."

She curled her lip in disdain. "That trash Sophia Laurent isn't fit to polish your shoes. I'll never let her step foot in the Winston family."

Isabella lowered her lashes, masking the calculation in her eyes.

"But Ethan..."

Ever since Sophia revealed her talents, Ethan Winston had convinced his parents to accept her. Now, Gabrielle was the only one still on Isabella's side.

"My brother's been bewitched by that vixen!" Gabrielle touched her cheek, fury burning in her gaze. "She's nothing but a pretty face. How dare she hit me? I'll make her pay."

A faint smirk ghosted across Isabella's lips.

"I heard Alexander Valdemar woke up. Everyone in our circle is avoiding Sophia now..."

Gabrielle scoffed. "Just wait. I'll tell Cousin Alexander everything and have him throw that used goods out on the street!"

Her face twisted with malice. A man like Alexander would never want a pregnant secondhand woman.

After starting at Versini Couture tomorrow, she'd personally visit Valdemar Holdings to expose Sophia's true colors.

Morning sunlight streamed through the curtains.

Sophia stretched lazily as her phone chimed.

"Ms. Laurent, Margaret and her granddaughter have arrived. Should I take them to Versini first and pick you up later?"

As the hidden owner, Sophia rarely appeared at the company. Only Gavin Winslow, the design director, knew her true identity.

"No need. I'll go myself."

Hanging up, she chose a Klein Blue dress. The knee-length cut accentuated her porcelain skin with elegant simplicity.

She loosely braided her hair, achieving a look of effortless sophistication.

Downstairs, Alexander sat at the dining table.

His black shirt outlined his broad shoulders. Sunlight sculpted his profile as he lifted a coffee cup with slender fingers.

Sophia froze, momentarily spellbound.

"Morning, sis!"

Adrian Valdemar yawned as he approached. "Why'd you stop?"

Following her gaze, he snorted.

"Tch..."
###Chapter 370

Adrian Valdemar leaned against the doorframe, a playful smirk curling his lips.

"Sister-in-law, don't you think my brother's face could use some genetic improvement for the next generation?"

His teasing tone snapped Sophia Laurent out of her daze from Alexander's striking looks.

She rolled her eyes.

"Aren't you supposed to be on set for your morning shoot? Get moving."

Adrian clutched his chest dramatically.

"You even remember my schedule? I'm touched!"

Sophia sighed.

Downstairs, Alexander glanced up at the commotion.

His gaze lingered on Sophia, a flicker of admiration in his eyes.

Adrian gave a half-hearted wave. "Morning."

"Good morning, Mr. Valdemar," Sophia greeted politely.

Alexander nodded slightly. "Come have breakfast."

The aroma from the lavish spread was impossible to resist.

"Sorry for intruding last night," Sophia said, picking up a shrimp dumpling. "You can discard anything I used."

Her unspoken message was clear—she wouldn't be returning.

Alexander merely acknowledged with a quiet hum.

Adrian nearly stomped his foot in frustration.

These two were infuriatingly composed.

After breakfast, Sophia pulled out her ride-hailing app.

"Sister-in-law!" Adrian exclaimed. "Let Alexander drive you!"

He seemed determined to milk the "sister-in-law" address for all it was worth.

Sophia declined. "That's not necessary—"

But Alexander was already approaching.

"It's on my way," he said smoothly. "We'll go together."

Against her better judgment, Sophia nodded.

An hour later, the Rolls-Royce Cullinan stopped before Chateau Versailles.

"Thank you," Sophia said distantly.

Her Klein Blue dress and pearl-white flats made her glow under the lights.

Every head turned as she entered the venue.

Daniel Lowell, bleary-eyed from an all-nighter, blinked at Sophia as if seeing a mirage.

Meanwhile, Gabrielle Winston made her entrance in a haute couture red gown dripping with diamonds.

She basked in the instant spotlight.
###Chapter 371

Gabrielle Winston ran a luxury product review account on social media. Her lavish lifestyle posts had garnered a sizable following.

At that moment, she was animatedly explaining the Winston family's background and her own design expertise to Isabella Evans.

The crowd suddenly stirred.

Gabrielle turned to see Sophia Laurent surrounded by reporters, camera flashes erupting around her.

"Mrs. Valdemar, is it true Mr. Valdemar has recovered and been discharged?"

"Will Mr. Valdemar's return affect your authority within the company?"

"Are you here to participate in the Starlight Design Awards?"

Sophia's lips curved into a poised smile as she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

"Company matters will be addressed by Mr. Valdemar himself. I suggest you wait for the official press conference."

She took a graceful half-step back, creating distance.

"As for participating..." A glint of amusement flashed in her eyes. "You could say that."

Attending as a judge certainly counted as participation.

The reporters eagerly pressed for more details.

Just as the atmosphere grew lively, a shrill voice cut through the air.

"Pathetic! Sophia Laurent, how dare you show your face at Starlight?"

Gabrielle strode forward in stilettos, disdain dripping from her gaze.

Most contestants were rising designers or at least formally trained.

What qualifications did Sophia have?

Sophia lifted her gaze, her calm eyes sweeping over Gabrielle's twisted expression.

"The competition is open to all who love design. There are no restrictions."

Gabrielle scoffed. "Take a good look in the mirror. This isn't your scene!"

The blatant provocation caused an immediate uproar. Some discreetly raised their phones, live-streaming the confrontation.

Comments exploded across screens:

Who is this lunatic? How dare she speak to Mrs. Valdemar like that?
Sophia's emerald gown is stunning! That elegance is killer!
Wait, isn't that the Winston heiress?
Gabrielle's fans quickly rallied:

Our Gabrielle is Mr. Valdemar's cousin!
She never picks fights unprovoked. Sophia must've done something!
Expose this fake saint!
Sophia ignored the spectacle.

As a representative of the event, she only needed to maintain composure.

"My schedule requires no concern."

The contrast was striking—one woman poised, the other hysterical.

The crowd's judgmental stares made Gabrielle's skin prickle.

Spotting the live cameras, her eyes hardened with malice.

Today, she'd expose this fraud in front of the entire world.
###Chapter 372

Sophia Laurent's pregnancy before marrying into the Valdemar family was considered a century-old disgrace to their prestigious lineage.

As the instigator of this scandal, she was destined to face the consequences.

Gabrielle Winston felt the judgmental stares around her. Burning with rage, she stormed toward Sophia.

"Stop pretending, Sophia!"

Her shrill voice cut through the venue, drawing everyone's attention.

Reporters immediately perked up, their professional instincts sensing a major scoop.

Sophia frowned slightly at Gabrielle's twisted expression.

"This is the Starlight Design Awards. Are you sure you want to cause a scene here?"

Gabrielle sneered.

"Cause a scene? I'm delivering justice!"

She scanned the crowd and raised her voice.

"Would Versini Couture really shield a shameless woman like you?"

The reporters grew even more excited, their cameras swiveling toward Sophia.

No one noticed Gavin Winslow, the design director of Versini Couture, rushing from backstage.

"Sophia!"

Gabrielle suddenly shrieked.

"You married into the Valdemar family with a bastard child, just for their money, didn't you?"

The room erupted in gasps.

Sophia's face darkened instantly.

Reporters swarmed forward.

"Mrs. Valdemar, is it true you're pregnant?"

"Who's the father? Does he know you got married?"

Questions flooded in like a tidal wave.

Gavin quickly intervened with security, forming a barrier.

"Please respect the competition's decorum."

His tone was polite but firm.

Yet the reporters persisted.

"Mrs. Valdemar, can you confirm the pregnancy rumors?"

A bespectacled male reporter shouted.

Gavin's eyes turned icy as he signaled security to escort the man out.

The other reporters hesitated but still watched with keen interest.

Gabrielle hadn't expected Gavin to defend Sophia. Her face twisted in displeasure.

"Sophia, don't you even have the courage to admit it?"

She mocked.

"Or do you not even know who the father is?"
###Chapter 373

The entire venue fell silent instantly. All eyes were fixed on Sophia Laurent and Gabrielle Winston.

Sophia's expression had turned icy the moment the reporter posed the question.

"It's the 21st century, Ms. Winston. Have you no basic manners?"

Gabrielle let out a derisive laugh, her eyes filled with contempt.

"You dare lecture me about manners? You're nothing but a gold-digging tramp."

She deliberately raised her voice. "Taking advantage of Alexander's coma to trick Patriarch Valdemar into marrying you. Quite the scheme."

Sophia's gaze turned razor-sharp.

"My personal affairs are none of your concern."

She didn't care about others' opinions, but Gabrielle's malicious slander was truly repulsive.

Daniel Lowell stood among the crowd, brows furrowed in silence.

Gabrielle lifted her chin triumphantly.

"Alexander is my cousin. I won't stand by while some scheming woman deceives him."

She glared venomously at Sophia. "And don't even think about setting your sights on the Winston family. We'd never accept secondhand goods!"

Sophia smirked coldly.

"The Winstons? I wouldn't take them if they were given to me."

"Though your behavior makes me question the family's upbringing."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Several judges frowned at Gabrielle's vulgar language.

"Starlight Design Awards has no place for contestants like you."

Gavin Winslow immediately signaled security.

"Escort this disruptive individual out."

Gabrielle's eyes widened in disbelief.

"On what grounds? I'm here to compete!"

She turned desperately to Isabella Evans, pleading for help.

Isabella finally stepped forward with deliberate slowness.

"Director Winslow, be reasonable."

She offered a fake smile. "My sister's young and impulsive. She's pulled all-nighters preparing for this competition. Show some leniency."

Gavin remained stone-faced.

"Remove her."

Panic set in as Gabrielle clutched Isabella's sleeve.

Isabella's eyes flashed with annoyance before forcing another smile.

"Director, considering Winston Enterprises' partnership with Versini Couture—"

Gavin cut her off.

"No exceptions."

Did they really think he'd risk angering the boss's wife?

"Gabrielle Winston is disqualified immediately."

Gabrielle turned pale.

She never expected Versini Couture to side with Sophia.

"Have you lost your minds? Sophia offended the Valdemars! Don't you fear—"

A cold male voice interrupted from the entrance.

"Who said the Valdemars have any grievance with Sophia Laurent?"
###Chapter 374

Gavin Winslow's knuckles turned white as he glared at Gabrielle Winston's arrogant expression.

"Versini Couture has no place for someone of your low character."

His icy voice echoed through the live broadcast.

"Keeping you here would only pollute our work environment."

Security personnel immediately stepped forward.

"Please leave immediately."

Gabrielle's face burned under the piercing stares from all directions. She desperately turned to Isabella Evans for help.

Isabella hadn't expected Gavin to support Sophia Laurent so vehemently.

She forced a smile and stepped forward to mediate.

"Director Winslow, there must be some misunderstanding."

Isabella lowered her posture. "Gabrielle just had some personal issues with Ms. Laurent. She acted impulsively—"

Gavin cut her off coldly.

"Ms. Evans, are you here to compete today?"

Isabella froze. "I accompanied Gabrielle."

"Then you may both leave."

Isabella's pupils constricted.

"With Gabrielle's disqualification, her companion naturally has no reason to stay."

His words landed like a hammer. Isabella's face drained of color.

How dare Versini treat a business partner this way?

The venue erupted in murmurs. All eyes turned to Sophia.

The young woman stood quietly in her white dress, her delicate features radiating quiet intensity.

A stark contrast to Gabrielle's disheveled appearance.

Gabrielle dug her nails into her palms, venom swirling in her eyes.

"Sophia, the Winstons won't—"

Before she could finish, security began dragging her out.

Isabella shot Sophia a furious glare before silently following.

The press remained deathly quiet, only daring to glance sideways at the mysterious Ms. Laurent.

The live footage instantly went viral.

#SophiaLaurentPregnancy? trended at number one.

"The timeline doesn't add up. Mr. Valdemar's been comatose for two months..."

"The Versini director's obvious bias suggests something's going on!"

Gabrielle's fans raged online.

"How dare some fashion competition humiliate our Gabrielle?"

"Are the judges blind?"
###Chapter 375

Camera flashes blinded Sophia Laurent, making her eyes sting.

Her protective hand flew to her abdomen—a gesture that only fueled more speculation.

"Is it true you're pregnant, Ms. Laurent?"

"Is the father Mr. Valdemar or Mr. Winston?"

The reporters' questions cut like knives.

Gavin Winslow stepped forward, his expression dark.

"Ladies and gentlemen, this is Versini Couture's launch event. Stay on topic."

He turned to Sophia, lowering his voice. "Go to the lounge."

She gave a slight nod and hurried away with security.

Behind her, frustrated journalists shouted follow-up questions.

Daniel Lowell watched from the shadows, his gaze complex as his sister retreated.

His fists clenched, nails biting into his palms.

"Ethan Winston's child..."

The thought tightened his chest.

If only he'd known sooner—

He shook his head violently, crushing the guilt.

Too late for regrets now.

Valdemar Holdings' executive floor hummed with tension.

Department heads delivered reports under the CEO's icy scrutiny.

A sharp chime interrupted.

Alexander Valdemar pressed the intercom, irritation flashing across his chiseled features.

"Tell Henry to wait."

But his assistant barged in anyway.

"Sir, your wife is in trouble."

Alexander's eyes transformed instantly.

"Meeting adjourned."

Executives exchanged bewildered looks before scrambling out.

Henry Chamberlain handed over a tablet.

Sophia's pale face dominated the screen.

"I am indeed pregnant."

The words struck like thunder.

Alexander shot up, his suit jacket overturning a teacup.

Dark liquid bled across important documents.

He didn't even glance at the damage.

"Get the car."

Watching his boss storm out, Henry exhaled in quiet relief.

Even glaciers could melt.
###Chapter 376

Alexander's grip tightened on the steering wheel.

His furrowed brow reflected in the rearview mirror.

The image of Sophia standing under flashing cameras haunted him.

Her slender fingers clutched the microphone, knuckles turning white.

"I am indeed pregnant." The words sliced through him like a dull blade.

He'd seen Sophia commanding boardrooms with effortless grace.

Watched her shine like a supermodel during Milan Fashion Week.

But never had he seen her so pale and cornered.

Alexander slammed the accelerator.

The black Maybach cut through the night like a blade.

Gabrielle's stiletto crushed the Versini Couture advertisement beneath her heel.

Sophia's flawless face smiled up from the torn flyer.

"Bitch!" Gabrielle shredded the paper between manicured nails.

Isabella handed her an iced americano.

"Relax. The entire internet's tearing her apart."

Gabrielle tapped her acrylic nails against the glass.

"Not enough." Her eyes narrowed. "I want her destroyed."

Her phone screen illuminated as she typed commands for the internet trolls.

"The Valdemars value reputation above all. Let's see how long the Patriarch tolerates this."

Isabella sipped her coffee.

A faint smirk played on her lips.

Sophia dominated the top three trending topics.

#SophiaLaurentPregnancyConfirmed

#ValdemarScandal

#EthanWinstonRejectionTruth

The comment section buzzed like a stirred hornet's nest.

"Who knew the ice queen was such a slut?"

"Poor Alexander, getting played like this."

"Rumor says she's sleeping with multiple sugar daddies..."

The few defenders drowned in the onslaught.

"What if it's Alexander's child?"

The reply came instantly.

"Delusional. Since when would a Valdemar stoop so low?"

Ethan's fountain pen bled ink across the contract.

His assistant's video showed no visible baby bump yet.

But the laughter usually sparkling in Sophia's eyes had been replaced by exhaustion.

He stood abruptly.

His suit jacket knocked over the coffee cup.

Dark liquid spread across the mahogany floor.

Just like that drunken night.

Fragmented memories surfaced.

Sophia's flushed cheeks.

Tangled sheets.

And... her choked sobs muffled against the pillow.

Ethan grabbed his keys and stormed out.

The elevator mirrors reflected his ashen face.
###Chapter 377

Sophia Laurent followed Gavin Winslow into the lounge.

The lock clicked shut behind them, muffling the noise from outside.

She exhaled deeply, her tense shoulders relaxing slightly.

"Ms. Laurent, I'm truly sorry about today..."

Gavin's voice was thick with regret.

Sophia shook her head, cutting him off. "It's not your fault."

If Gabrielle Winston had been determined to expose this, it would have happened eventually.

It was just unfortunate timing—right during the Starlight Design Awards.

"You should go. I need some time alone."

As the head of Versini Couture, Gavin had his hands full today.

He hesitated before nodding. "Call me if you need anything."

Pregnancy was a private matter, and as a man, he knew better than to pry.

The room fell silent once he left.

Sophia rested a hand on her abdomen, her expression conflicted.

She had planned to keep this child completely separate from Ethan Winston.

But Gabrielle had interfered.

Rubbing her temples, Sophia sighed.

Neither the Valdemars nor the Winstons were families she could afford to cross.

Now she'd managed to offend both at once.

She pulled out her phone, checking the online backlash.

The moment she logged into her social media, her inbox flooded with messages.

Her phone froze for a full thirty seconds before recovering.

A quick scan of the comments made her blood run cold.

The scandal was spreading faster than she'd anticipated.

In just fifteen minutes, it had already reached the bottom of the trending list.

And the numbers were still climbing.

She immediately dialed Oliver Granger. "Take down the hashtag. Now."

Outside the lounge, the audience buzzed with gossip.

Meanwhile, in the hotel parking lot, two luxury cars pulled in simultaneously—a black Rolls-Royce and a white Bentley.

Two tall, imposing men stepped out.

Their eyes locked.

"Cousin."

"Alexander."

The air turned icy after the brief greeting.

Ethan broke the silence first. "What a coincidence. What brings you here?"

Alexander Valdemar's expression remained unreadable. "I'm here for my wife."

The term made Ethan stiffen.

Alexander said it so naturally, as if it were an indisputable fact.

Ethan's voice sharpened. "So you're just accepting this arranged marriage? Marrying someone who doesn't love you?"

Alexander's gaze turned glacial. "Watch your tongue."

"Sophia is my wife. This was decided by both families."
###Chapter 378

Ethan Winston froze at Alexander Valdemar's formal address.

They were cousins who had grown up together.

Though busy with their respective careers in recent years, their bond remained.

That summer at their grandfather's estate, they'd caught cicadas and stolen peaches from the orchard.

Now Alexander was calling him "Mr. Winston."

The cold formality felt like a bucket of ice water dumped over Ethan's head.

What shocked him more were Alexander's next words.

"No matter what happened, Sophia Laurent is now my wife."

Ethan's fingers clenched unconsciously.

"Cousin, are you serious?"

He'd assumed this marriage was merely transactional.

Alexander and Sophia barely knew each other. The arrangement could end anytime.

But Alexander's attitude completely defied his expectations.

Alexander paused mid-step.

"Dead serious."

Three weighted words.

Without looking back, he strode toward the elevator.

Ethan stood stunned for two seconds before hurrying after him.

Backstage at the competition venue, Gavin Winslow reviewed the finals schedule.

His assistant rushed in.

"Mr. Winslow, two VIP guests have arrived."

"Have them wait," Gavin said without looking up.

"It's Mr. Valdemar and Mr. Winston."

Gavin's documents clattered to the floor.

He jerked his head up.

"Who?"

The assistant swallowed hard. "The heads of Valdemar Holdings and Winston Group."

Gavin inhaled sharply.

Sophia's pregnancy news had broken less than an hour ago.

And now both men showed up simultaneously?

Fumbling with the papers, he hurried out.

Outside his office, he found the two men surrounded by reporters.

Under the camera flashes, Alexander and Ethan both wore thunderous expressions.

"My wife and I have known each other for years."

"There's simply been a misunderstanding between Sophia and me."

Gavin quickly signaled security to clear a path.

"This way, gentlemen."

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead.

These two were business titans.

And both had complicated ties to Sophia.

In the lounge, Sophia stared blankly at her phone screen.

She'd just promised Alexander yesterday to keep their divorce quiet.

Now this scandal exploded overnight.

Sighing, she dialed Alexander's number.
###Chapter 379

Alexander Valdemar was walking alongside Gavin Winslow when his phone suddenly vibrated.

He pulled it out, and the name flashing on the screen instantly softened the stern lines of his brow.

"Mr. Valdemar, I'm sorry..." Sophia Laurent's hesitant voice came through. "I might have to break my promise."

With her pregnancy now public, the divorce could no longer stay hidden.

She couldn't let Alexander bear the stigma of being a cuckold.

Alexander paused mid-step, his voice gentle. "Don't worry. I'm coming over."

Ethan Winston frowned beside him.

Since when had Sophia become so familiar with Alexander?

"That's unnecessary!" Sophia quickly refused. "I can handle this myself."

She bit her lower lip. "It's just... the divorce can't be kept secret anymore..."

Before she could finish, footsteps sounded at the door.

Sophia looked up to see Alexander's tall frame already standing before her.

The man wore an impeccably tailored black suit, his slender fingers still holding the phone to his ear.

Their eyes met, and Sophia's breath caught.

She hadn't expected his "coming over" to mean literally this second.

"Sophia." Ethan's voice broke the silence. "We need to talk."

Sophia averted her gaze, her tone cold. "There's nothing to discuss."

"What about the child?" Ethan took a deep breath. "Isn't that worth talking about?"

Sophia's eyes darkened. "No."

"This child belongs only to me. It has nothing to do with you."

She intended to draw a clear line.

But then Ethan's eyes lit up. "How could it not involve me?"

From her words, he became certain something had indeed happened after that Met Gala Afterparty.

He'd just been too drunk to remember.

The thought made the corners of his mouth lift uncontrollably. "Sophia, the child is mine, isn't it?"

"I promise to treat you both well. I'll never hurt you again."

Sophia's expression turned even colder at his joyful demeanor. "No need."

"If you insist on bothering me because of this child, I'd rather not have it."

Ethan's smile froze.

It suddenly occurred to him—the gala had been three months ago.

Even if she were pregnant, it would only be about two months along now.

"Don't be rash." He softened his tone. "Name any condition you want."

Sophia smirked. "Really?"

"Of course." Hope reignited in Ethan's eyes.

"Then disappear from my life forever."
###Chapter 380

Sophia's voice was sharp and decisive, like a honed blade.

Gavin wisely closed the door, leaving the three of them in privacy.

Ethan's expression darkened instantly, his fingers clenching unconsciously.

"Do you want the child to grow up without a father from birth?"

Sophia's jaw tightened. "That's my choice."

Alexander's cool voice cut through the tension. "Who says the child won't have a father?"

His indifferent gaze swept over Ethan. "Besides, Sophia never confirmed the child is yours."

Though the memory of that night was hazy, he remembered the girl's inexperienced reactions.

The scratches she left on his back still made his throat tighten when he recalled them.

Sophia relaxed slightly at Alexander's words.

"Exactly. The child isn't yours."

"Impossible!"

Ethan raised his voice sharply.

"I've been the only man in your life for three years. If not mine, then whose?"

Seeing Alexander shielding Sophia, he let out a cold laugh.

"But it could never be yours, Mr. Valdemar."

He spat out the last two words through gritted teeth.

Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine his most respected cousin would steal his love.

Alexander remained impassive, his voice steady. "I respect her decision."

Sophia's heart trembled slightly.

She gave Alexander a small nod. "Thank you."

Ethan's face turned ashen.

Suppressing his rage, he forced his tone to soften.

"Sophia, this concerns the Winston family bloodline. Please think carefully."

"I've already arranged with my family to marry you after your divorce."

"For the child's sake, don't act recklessly."

He left hurriedly before she could say anything more painful.

Silence fell over the room.

Sophia collapsed into a chair, exhaling deeply.

Alexander looked down at her. "Just follow your heart."

His voice soothed her anxiety like a mountain spring.

Ethan's words had indeed pressured her.

If the Winston family insisted on pursuing this, things could get complicated.

"Can I... really do as I please?"

"Yes."

Alexander's gaze was firm. "If you don't want any connection with Ethan, I can be the child's father."

Sophia's eyes widened. "?!"
###Chapter 381 

"This can't be right."

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly. She hadn't even dared to consider making Alexander the scapegoat. Yet here he was, offering himself?

Alexander's godlike features remained impassive. "Why not?"

A dark glint flashed in his eyes. Perhaps this child was his blood all along.

"Can you tell me the exact conception date?"

Sophia didn't understand his question but answered truthfully. "About two months and a few days."

Alexander's breath hitched.

Two months ago. The night they'd spent together on the cruise.

"Have you had thorough examinations?"

Sophia nodded. "Yes."

If not for that prenatal checkup where she'd run into Gabrielle, today's scandal wouldn't have happened.

"I'll take you to Valdemar Medical Center for reevaluation." Alexander paused. "Their facilities are superior."

After consideration, Sophia agreed it was prudent. "Once I finish here. Thank you."

Valdemar Medical wasn't just top-tier—its discretion was unparalleled.

Alexander's tense shoulders relaxed slightly. "I'll wait."

He knelt before her, his usually stern expression softening in a rare display.

Sophia's heartbeat stuttered.

She turned her face away with quiet thanks, her ears turning pink.

Since the news broke, she'd imagined countless scenarios.

Never had she expected Alexander to stand by her without hesitation.

An unfamiliar sense of security bloomed within her.

Meanwhile, the internet exploded.

#AlexanderValdemarEthanWinstonAtStarlightAwards trended instantly.

Comments flooded in:
"Holy shit! Which one's the dad?"
"My money's on Ethan! Alexander's whole devoted act is just PR."
"Getting knocked up to trap the Valdemars? Sophia's got balls..."

On the "River Banquet" set, Emily had just finished filming her coronation scene when a friend pulled her aside.

"Emily! Your family's in major trouble!"

Still basking in her romance with Ryan, she smiled. "What happened?"

"Your sister's pregnant! The whole net's debating whether it's Alexander or Ethan's!"

Emily's pupils constricted.

Then her lips curled into a cold smile.

What perfect timing.

All she needed was to leak that footage of Sophia being assaulted by those thugs...

No matter whose bastard it was, the scandal would ruin her completely.
###Chapter 382

Emily Lowell had nearly drained her savings to obtain that compromising video.

True to her cautious nature, she'd only paid half the ransom upfront to the kidnappers.

When the footage finally arrived, she found it disappointingly dark and blurry.

Only shadowy figures of gangsters surrounding a woman could be vaguely discerned.

The woman's face remained obscured, captured only in partial profile.

Fortunately, the silhouette bore some resemblance to Sophia Laurent's delicate features and slender frame.

Combined with the prearranged hotel surveillance footage, it would suffice to cement Sophia's scandalous reputation.

Backstage at the Starlight Design Awards, Sophia sat pensively in her dressing room.

After expressing her gratitude, she fell into deep contemplation.

The media's relentless inquiries about her child's paternity demanded a strategic response.

Perhaps silence would serve as her most powerful weapon.

She wasn't part of the entertainment circus, after all.

Alexander Valdemar stood nearby, his gaze softening imperceptibly.

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension.

A sharp knock shattered the quiet moment.

"Ms. Laurent, all competition entries have been submitted. Judging commences shortly." Gavin Winslow's voice carried through the door. "Our senior design team awaits your presence."

Straightening her collar, Sophia rose. "I'm coming."

This biennial event had humble beginnings.

Originally an internal company evaluation, she and Gavin had overseen its entirety.

As Versini Couture's prestige grew, so did participant numbers and judging panels.

To ensure absolute transparency, they'd transitioned to live-streamed evaluations.

The moment Sophia stepped out, a barrage of stares assaulted her.

Reporters' eyes gleamed with predatory interest at her appearance.

When Alexander emerged behind her, their excitement nearly boiled over.

Gavin's icy warning cut through the buzz. "Any off-topic questions will result in immediate expulsion."

His words doused the journalists' nosy enthusiasm like cold water.

While Sophia's personal life tempted them, ejection meant professional failure.

The live broadcast commenced.

Tension crackled through the venue.

Designers from across the nation coveted positions at elite fashion houses.

Yet one question burned brighter than Sophia's scandal—why did she occupy the head judge's seat?

Even Versini's president Gavin Winslow sat subordinate to her.

A reporter couldn't resist. "By what authority does Ms. Laurent judge this competition?"

The question barely skirted acceptable boundaries.

Gavin's sharp glance silenced further inquiries. "She isn't a contestant."

Daniel Lowell frowned from the audience.

His recent employment at Versini hadn't revealed any special connection between Gavin and Sophia.

His phone screen illuminated, showing only design draft exchanges with Gavin.

Staff began distributing competition blueprints to the judges.
###Chapter 383

The design sketches were neatly spread across the long table. Three senior designers, along with Gavin Winslow and Sophia Laurent, carefully examined each drawing.

Live comments exploded across streaming platforms.

"The pregnancy rumors about Sophia Laurent aren't even settled yet. How did she end up on the judges' panel?"

"Can just anyone sit there?"

"Is Director Winslow insane? Letting an amateur judge professional designs?"

"Versini Couture's Imperial Splendor collection is stunning, but this is downright disrespectful to contestants!"

Sophia's fans grew frantic.

"There must be a reason Sophia's sitting there!"

"Director Winslow wouldn't do something reckless..."

Media reporters grinned ear-to-ear at the skyrocketing viewership numbers.

A journalist seized the moment. "Director Winslow, is Sophia Laurent also judging today?"

Gavin adjusted his black-framed glasses with conviction. "Correct."

"But Ms. Laurent isn't a trained designer. She's never formally studied fashion design. Isn't this—"

"Who said Sophia isn't a professional designer?" Gavin interrupted sharply.

The live stream erupted.

"Lies! I'll eat my keyboard if she's actually a designer!"

"This woman's addicted to publicity stunts!"

The reporter pressed further. "Are you claiming Sophia Laurent is indeed a designer for Versini Couture?"

Every eye in the venue turned toward the judges' panel.

Daniel Lowell stood among the crowd, his pupils contracting sharply.

The young woman in the Klein Blue dress studied the sketches with focused intensity. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows, casting an elegant silhouette around her.

How could she possibly... be a Versini Couture designer?
###Chapter 384

The venue erupted in chaos.

Daniel Lowell stared fixedly at the official website screenshot displayed on the large screen.

The mysterious chief designer "Tang Su," whom he had long admired, was actually Sophia Laurent?

His fists clenched violently.

Nails dug deep into his palms.

"Impossible..."

He muttered under his breath.

Gavin Winslow surveyed the room, a faint smile playing on his lips.

"That's right. Tang Su is Sophia Laurent."

The words detonated like a bomb.

Silence swallowed the entire venue.

Live stream comments exploded instantly.

"Holy shit!"

"I'm shook!"

"Sophia is Versini Couture's chief designer?!"

"The genius behind the Imperial Splendor collection?"

Journalists exchanged bewildered glances.

One reporter pressed, "Director Winslow, this is unbelievable. How old is Sophia?"

Gavin chuckled lightly.

"Age has never been the measure of talent."

He clicked open a video.

Sophia's design sketches appeared on the screen.

Fluid lines.

Breathtaking color palettes.

Each sheet signed "Tang Su" in the corner.

Daniel looked as if struck by lightning.

Those design philosophies he revered.

Those masterpieces he had studied obsessively.

All created by Sophia?

Suddenly, Gavin's past words echoed in his mind.

"The chief designer has an impeccable eye."

"She spotted your flaws immediately."

That "she" had been Sophia all along.

Reporters continued probing.

"If Sophia is the chief designer, why has she remained anonymous?"

Gavin shrugged.

"She prefers quiet creativity."

"Her identity wouldn't have been revealed if not for the recent doubts."

In the live stream, fans were losing their minds.

"What kind of goddess did I stan?!"

"A musical prodigy! Business genius! Now a top-tier designer!"

"Is there anything Sophia can't do?"

In a corner of the venue, Daniel's face turned ashen.

Now he understood why Gavin had suddenly distanced himself.

Because of Sophia.

Because of his past condescension and mockery toward her.

Looking back—

Those arrogant critiques.

Those patronizing lectures.

They were utterly laughable.

He rose slowly.

Under the crowd's stunned gazes, he walked out without a backward glance.
###Chapter 385

I had noticed that familiar design aesthetic, but never dared to confirm it.

That was the designer of the Imperial Splendor collection! Who would have imagined she'd be so young?

...

The internet exploded with discussions.

Two topics about Sophia Laurent simultaneously topped the trending charts.

#SophiaLaurentPregnant
#SophiaLaurentIsVersiniSugar

Either one could set the entire internet ablaze.

If the first was merely celebrity gossip about personal life.

Then the second completely upended the entire fashion industry's understanding.

The reporter's hand trembled as he clutched the microphone. "Director Winslow, are you saying... Sophia Laurent is Versini's Sugar designer?"

His voice shook with disbelief.

Gavin Winslow surveyed the room with satisfaction. "That's correct. Sophia Laurent is Sugar."

Silence fell so complete you could hear a pin drop.

After a long pause, someone finally managed to ask, "Is... is this real?"

"Absolutely confirmed."

The venue erupted like boiling water.

Every gaze turned scorching with admiration.

Everyone present had fashion design backgrounds.

Many were already devoted fans of Sugar.

Now they stared at the poised young woman on stage with undisguised reverence.

"Master Sugar! I'm your biggest fan!"
"Can we take photos after the competition?"
"Oh my God, I'm actually seeing my idol! This contest was worth it!"

Meanwhile, Daniel Lowell in the audience turned deathly pale.

He stared at Sophia as if struck by lightning.

She was Sugar?

If only he'd known earlier...

Would his career have taken a completely different path?

A storm of emotions paralyzed him where he sat.

Gavin Winslow smiled at the reactions.

Their timing for revealing her identity had been carefully calculated.

Sophia's new "Crane Dynasty" collection would debut at Milan Fashion Week—perfect for publicity.

They just hadn't anticipated Gabrielle Winston's interference.

"Master Sugar's new 'Crane Dynasty' collection will premiere at Milan Fashion Week. Stay tuned."

Alexander Valdemar sat behind Sophia, absorbing the electric atmosphere.

An unfamiliar swell of pride rose in his chest.

For the first time, he felt proud—for her.
###Chapter 386

Daniel Lowell stood frozen in the crowd, his fingertips turning icy.

His gaze remained locked on the radiant figure at the judges' panel, ears ringing.

Sophia Laurent was Composer T.

The realization struck him like a sledgehammer to the chest.

Memories flooded back.

Six months ago at that high-society tea party, Victoria Lowell had boasted about borrowing Versini Couture's latest gown.

He'd just joined Versini then, nearly dropping his phone when the call came.

That celestial dress was Composer T's personal design - not for sale.

He'd reluctantly approached Gavin Winslow.

The design director's eager agreement replayed vividly in his mind.

Every privilege had stemmed from Sophia.

On stage, Sophia announced her new collection's imminent release.

The venue erupted.

"Oh my god! Composer T is releasing new work!"

"The Lowells were blind to discard a real phoenix."

"Didn't their second son also work at Versini?"

"Daniel Lowell...won some design awards..."

The murmurs pierced his eardrums like needles.

Daniel clenched his fists until nails bit into palms.

The online storm gained momentum.

A celebrity gossip account dropped explosive footage.

#SHOCKING: Sophia Laurent's Scandalous Night Caught on Camera#

The video showed an intoxicated Sophia leaning against a hotel corridor wall.

Her smoke-gray gown accentuated every curve.

Elevator doors opened.

Six tattooed thugs surrounded her.

"Miss Laurent, let us show you a good time tonight."

"You said you enjoyed it last time..."

The lead thug with bleached hair reached for her waist.
###Chapter 387

The surveillance footage showed several gangsters with bleached hair making lewd remarks at Sophia Laurent.

One of them suddenly grabbed her slender wrist.

The burly leader towered over her, casting her completely in his shadow.

The camera angle was awkward, making it impossible to see if she resisted.

The seven men shoved her toward the end of the hallway.

The footage cut to six gangsters entering a room one by one.

Based on the timeline, Sophia should have been the first inside.

The door slammed shut.

The screen changed again.

Even the heavy pixelation couldn’t hide the depraved scene.

Six shirtless men crowded around a bed.

Only half of the woman’s face was visible.

But that signature cascade of wavy hair and delicate profile unmistakably belonged to Sophia.

The video sent shockwaves across the internet.

Save it now! This won’t stay up for three minutes!

It’s definitely a deepfake. The tech these days is terrifying.

Have media outlets completely lost their integrity for clicks?

At first, netizens refused to believe it.

Until someone dug up candid photos of Sophia at a Met Gala Afterparty that night.

She was wearing the exact same smoky-gray gown as in the video.

Forensic experts weighed in.

My professor just analyzed this with professional software. No signs of Photoshop.

Frame-by-frame inspection shows basic editing but no face-swapping.

So… this is real?

My god! This is explosive!

Public opinion flipped instantly.

Was this consensual or forced?

Clearly forced! My fists are clenched just watching!

So the baby she’s carrying is…?

The comment section erupted.

Sophia’s diehard fans clung to denial.

Even if it’s real, the baby might not be theirs!

Sophia’s ex and current partner are both gorgeous. Why would she stoop to these thugs?

Who’d trade filet mignon for garbage?

Mass unfollowing began.

No matter what, she’s tainted in my eyes now.

Disgraced celebrities like her deserve to be blacklisted!
###Chapter 388

The report button was slammed with force.

The comment section overflowed with vile obscenities.

"Tsk tsk, what a body. Too bad it's wasted on those people..."

"Stop pretending to be innocent. She clearly wanted it!"

Sophia Laurent's follower count plummeted.

Her anti-fans swarmed like sharks scenting blood, tearing into her across every platform.

"This kind of disgraceful celebrity should be banned!"

"Take all her songs off streaming platforms!"

Her loyal fans fought back fiercely. The online battlefield burned with chaos.

By the restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows, Gabrielle Winston swirled her wine glass.

The phone screen reflected her twisted smile.

"See, Isabella? Just as I said... that bastard in Sophia's belly—"

Isabella Evans sliced her steak with elegant precision, a smirk playing on her lips.

"How pitiful..."

She lowered her gaze to hide the glee in her eyes.

Gabrielle suddenly raised her voice. "She brought this on herself!"

Before she could finish, a shadow loomed over the table.

Ethan Winston stood there, his expression stormy.

"Brother! Look at this video—"

Gabrielle eagerly thrust her phone forward.

Ethan didn't take it.

"Why wasn't I told about her pregnancy?"

His voice was glacial.

Gabrielle dramatically covered her mouth.

"Oh please, that filthy woman isn't fit to carry a Winston heir!"

SLAP!

A sharp crack echoed through the restaurant.

Gabrielle clutched her cheek, eyes wide with disbelief.

"You hit me? For that slut?"

Ethan's fists clenched.

"Say one more word about her and I'll—"

Gabrielle burst into hysterical laughter.

She tapped open the video.

"See how dirty your precious Sophia really is!"

The footage showed Sophia stumbling unsteadily.

Ethan's pupils constricted.

Fragments of memory flashed—the gala... supporting her... blurred figures...

By the fifth replay, Ethan shattered his wine glass against the table.

"Animals!"

His hands trembled as he opened the comment section.
###Chapter 389

The hashtag #SophiaLaurentScandal was trending at the top of the charts.

Ethan Winston's fingers froze on his phone screen. His expression darkened instantly.

He immediately dialed the PR department. "Take that trending topic down now!"

The PR director's voice trembled. "Mr. Winston, it's too viral. We can't suppress it..."

Ethan ended the call and turned to leave.

"Stop!"

Gabrielle Winston blocked his path, her eyes burning with resentment.

"Brother, don't waste your energy. Is a woman like that worthy of our family?"

Ethan frowned. "Why do you hate her so much?"

"Hate?" Gabrielle sneered. "She stole everything from me!"

Ever since Sophia appeared, her brother's affection was no longer hers alone.

For that woman, Ethan had even raised his voice at her for the first time.

Her fists clenched tightly. "Isabella Evans is the only one who should be my sister-in-law!"

Ethan's gaze turned icy. "You've disappointed me."

His retreating figure made Gabrielle's heart tremble.

Isabella stood in the shadows, her nails digging into her palms.

"Sophia... why don't you just die..."

At the competition venue, Sophia was intently reviewing the entries.

She occasionally handed exceptional designs to Gavin Winslow.

"This one shows remarkable creativity."

Gavin nodded. "The line work is masterful."

The five judges conferred in low voices.

Countless eyes in the audience were fixed on Sophia.

When Ethan returned, this was the scene that greeted him.

Sophia on the judging panel, radiant as ever.

The memory of that video stabbed at his heart.

That night...

He had left with Sophia.

Why was she alone in the end?

Who took her away?

Ethan approached Sophia, his voice hoarse. "Sophia, can we talk?"
###Chapter 390

Sophia Laurent's brows twitched imperceptibly at the sound of Ethan Winston's voice.

The venue buzzed with chatter. Suppressing her irritation, she maintained a professional smile.

"Mr. Winston, we have nothing to discuss. Please leave."

Ethan stood unmoving, his gaze as resolute as a soldier heading into battle.

"Sophia, don't worry. No matter what happens, I'll stand by you."

A flicker of confusion crossed Sophia's eyes. She couldn't fathom why he'd suddenly say such a thing.

The audience below could barely contain their gossip-fueled excitement.

Many had already seen the video Emily Lowell released, along with the mysteriously vanished trending topic.

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

Oh my god! Mr. Winston is so devoted! Showing up to support Sophia at a time like this!

Sophia's been cold to him, yet he persists. That's true love!

I'm shipping this couple now!

Don't be ridiculous! Mr. Valdemar is sitting right there. He's her actual husband!

The live stream chat exploded.

Does Mr. Valdemar even know what's happening online?

Once he finds out the truth, he'll walk away for sure!

Even as a Sophia-Alexander shipper, no man could accept something like this.

Ethan's appearance sent online discourse into a frenzy.

Some began fervently shipping the pair, while others stood firm with the original couple.

Henry Chamberlain smirked coldly at his phone screen.

He held the complete, unedited footage.

Back when investigating Tiffany Morrison, he'd paid top dollar for hackers to restore the hotel surveillance.

The version circulating online was maliciously edited.

"Find out who's behind this," he ordered into the phone.

Two hours later, the competition results were announced.

Sophia and Gavin Winslow, along with three judges, selected thirty outstanding designs.

"Congratulations to these thirty designers for joining Versini Couture," Sophia announced brightly.

The competition had been anonymous, with entries identified only by number.

Gavin took the microphone. "Selected designers, please stay for onboarding procedures."

Cheers and sighs filled the venue.

Unsuccessful candidates departed while winners remained, elated.

Not a single reporter left. Cameras remained trained on Sophia.

As Gavin prepared to speak, a journalist interrupted.

"Director Winslow, now that the competition's over, may we interview Ms. Laurent?"

A secretary hurried to Gavin's side, whispering urgently in his ear.
###Chapter 391

Gavin Winslow turned his phone screen toward Sophia Laurent, his fingertips trembling slightly.

The dim hallway lights in the video illuminated Sophia's disheveled clothes and unsteady steps.

Her pupils constricted, nails digging deep into her palms.

"This can't be..."

Reporters clamored outside, held back by security, cameras still raised stubbornly.

Alexander Valdemar stood a short distance away when his phone screen lit up.

Beneath Henry Chamberlain's missed call notification, two unread messages waited.

He tapped the first video link.

Six men surrounded Sophia in the footage, the grotesque scene making his fingers tighten around the device.

The second was the original hotel surveillance footage.

It documented the entire process of Sophia being drugged.

Ethan Winston noticed Alexander's darkening expression and lowered his voice. "This is my fault."

The footage showed him personally escorting Sophia back to her room after the gala.

Alexander's gaze sharpened like a blade. "You should take responsibility."

Gavin pulled Sophia aside by the window, his voice strained. "Sophia, the whole internet is spreading—"

Sophia stared at the hallway footage, her blood turning to ice.

In the clip, she stumbled into a man's arms, clearly disoriented.

When the man turned—it was Alexander's face.

"This is doctored!" She jerked her head up.

Alexander strode over and shoved his phone in front of her.

Two videos played side by side.

One was the viral "scandal footage."

The other was the authentic hotel surveillance.

Sophia's face drained of color. "Someone is trying to ruin me."

Ethan slammed his fist against the wall. "I'll find out who leaked the footage!"

The reporters' shouts filtered through the door.

"Ms. Laurent, care to comment on the video's authenticity?"

"What is your relationship with Mr. Valdemar?"

Gavin shielded Sophia, his voice shaking. "What do we do now?"

Alexander suddenly grasped Sophia's hand.

His fingers were cold, but his tone was firm. "Come with me."

Ethan blocked their path. "Where are you taking her?"

Alexander's gaze was razor-sharp. "To fix this."

Sophia watched the two men face off and let out a soft, humorless laugh.

She pulled her hand free and straightened her collar.

"I'll handle it myself."

Under their stunned gazes, she turned and yanked open the lounge door.

Blinding camera flashes instantly swallowed her.
###Chapter 392

Ethan Winston's eyes darkened at Alexander Valdemar's icy tone.

"I understand."

He had originally believed Sophia Laurent left the hotel on her own that night.

Now with the video exposed, he vaguely recalled handing Sophia over to someone else himself.

"I'll take full responsibility."

Ethan's voice was resolute. "No matter what she's been through, my feelings won't change."

Alexander seemed perplexed by his stance.

His gaze swept over Ethan coldly. "Unnecessary."

He pocketed his phone, his voice low.

"Sophia is mine. Responsibility isn't yours to claim."

Ethan frowned deeply.

"What do you mean?"

His tone was disbelieving. "You'd still stay with Sophia after this?"

Alexander's voice remained calm. "If she wishes it."

"I can't comprehend this."

Ethan shook his head. "You two share no special bond. Why go to such lengths?"

A shadow flickered through Alexander's eyes. "You wouldn't understand."

But he offered no explanation, striding past Ethan toward Sophia.

Sophia's face was frosty after viewing the footage.

"Director Gavin, that woman isn't me."

Though the resemblance was uncanny, it absolutely wasn't her.

Gavin Winslow exhaled in relief.

"Thank goodness."

His back had been drenched in cold sweat watching the video.

If even he was this shocked, Sophia's reaction was understandable.

Thankfully, it wasn't her.

Realization dawned on Gavin, his expression turning furious. "This is clearly an attempt to ruin you."

His voice was urgent. "The public already believes it's real. What do we do now?"

Sophia's eyes were glacial. "We need irrefutable proof to clear my name."

Otherwise, the public wouldn't believe her.

Gavin looked troubled. "But whoever released this must have destroyed the original..."

Sophia had anticipated this.

When she'd gone to check the hotel surveillance, she was told all footage from that night was missing.

The thought made her heart heavier.

Remembering the reporters' aggressive behavior earlier, she could already foresee the harassment to come.

She'd likely be hounded by journalists wherever she went.

Just as frustration threatened to overwhelm her, a cool voice cut through.

"Ms. Laurent, a word."

She turned to meet Alexander's penetrating gaze.

Before Sophia could respond, another figure intervened.

"Sophia..."

Ethan's face was etched with guilt. "No matter what happens, I'll stand by you. I won't judge you. After the divorce, I'll propose to you publicly—"

Sophia had intended to ignore him.

But his words piqued her interest. "Really?"

Encouraged by her response, Ethan nodded emphatically. "Absolutely."
###Chapter 393

Sophia's lips curved slightly, but her eyes remained cold.

High society in the capital valued pedigree and reputation above all.

With the scandal raging online, how could the Winstons ever accept a daughter-in-law like her?

If Alexander insisted on marrying her, he might even lose his position as heir.

"Sophia, my parents are open-minded," Ethan said, avoiding her gaze. His voice lacked conviction.

"Really?" Sophia let out a light laugh. "Would the Winstons accept a woman entangled with six men?"

Ethan's expression darkened.

He thought the online bullying had driven her to delusion.

"Don't talk about yourself like that," he said, suppressing his guilt. "To me, you'll always be pure."

"And what about this child?" Sophia placed a hand on her abdomen, meeting his eyes directly.

Ethan's voice turned grim. "Get rid of it."

The Winstons might tolerate her for the sake of the Lowell Group.

But they would never accept another man's child.

Sophia's smile vanished.

"No need," she said coldly. "Since you're convinced it's not yours, don't come looking for me again."

Ethan jerked his head up.

"You're keeping that bastard?" His eyes widened in disbelief.

Sophia's gaze turned sharp as a blade.

"Ethan Winston!" She enunciated each word. "Call my child that again, and I won't hold back."

Ethan froze under her glare.

He'd never seen this side of Sophia before—cold, resolute, a stranger that unsettled him.

Sophia turned and walked toward Alexander.

"Let's talk inside," she said wearily, rubbing her temples.

Alexander followed silently.

In the lounge, Sophia collapsed onto the sofa, drained.

The day's events had unfolded too suddenly.

Seeing her pale face, Alexander's chest ached.

From their conversation, he'd guessed the truth.

That child... was likely his.

"Sophia, about the baby—" he began carefully.

The priority now was dealing with the online storm.

But the memory of that night at the hotel—he didn't know how to bring it up.
###Chapter 394

Sophia Laurent's fingers unconsciously tightened around her skirt when Alexander Valdemar posed his question.

She had believed the child was Ethan Winston's, but his attitude had shattered her heart.

Not only had Ethan denied paternity, but he'd looked at her with disgust—as if she were something filthy.

The composure she'd maintained in front of everyone crumbled.

"I don't know."

Her voice was feather-light, her lashes trembling slightly. "I truly don't know."

Growing up in an orphanage, she'd yearned for family but remained achingly alone. Keeping this child had been her one solace.

Now, even that was slipping away.

Suddenly, the warm scent of pine enveloped her.

Alexander had moved beside her without her noticing, drawing her into a gentle embrace.

It was perfect—supportive without being suffocating.

"Mr. Valdemar?"

Sophia looked up in confusion, meeting his deep gaze.

Alexander released her abruptly, his ears tinged pink. "Apologies."

Seeing her reddened eyes and how the blue dress accentuated her fragility, his chest tightened inexplicably.

"I'm sorry."

Sophia blinked. "For what?"

"That night..." His Adam's apple bobbed. "I was at the gala too."

"I know." She forced a weak smile. "How could anyone not recognize the illustrious CEO of Valdemar Group?"

A flicker of surprise crossed his eyes. "You know me?"

"Alexander Valdemar. Business legend." Her voice softened. "Hard to miss."

He chuckled, the stern lines of his face relaxing.

Sophia stared, momentarily entranced.

"A shame..." Alexander sighed.

"A shame?"

"That Mrs. Valdemar doesn't think much of me."

Her eyes widened. "What Mrs. Valdemar?"

He held her gaze, enunciating clearly.

"You."
###Chapter 395

Sophia's fingers trembled slightly as she instinctively took half a step back.

"It's not that I'm disgusted." Her voice was barely audible.

The moment the words left her lips, she regretted them.

What relationship did she and Alexander even have to speak of disgust?

They were strangers bound by a contractual marriage.

Alexander's intense gaze burned into her. "Then why insist on divorce?"

Sophia turned her face away, avoiding his eyes.

"You know my situation..."

She was carrying another man's child. This marriage shouldn't continue.

"And we..."

The thought of two strangers suddenly living under the same roof was suffocating.

Alexander's eyes dropped to her rounded belly, his Adam's apple bobbing.

"Sophia, there's something you should know."

She kept her head lowered. "What is it?"

"If we find the father, would you be with him?"

A thin layer of sweat formed on Alexander's palms as he asked.

Sophia's head snapped up. "What do you mean?"

After a weighted silence, Alexander pulled out his phone.

"Watch this first."

He played the video Henry had sent and handed it to Sophia.

The footage showed a glittering banquet hall.

A drunken Sophia was seen being helped out by Ethan.

Then the scene shifted to Emily appearing beside Ethan.

Sophia's pupils constricted.

After exchanging a few words, Ethan handed her over to Emily.

Emily guided her into an elevator.

The elevator stopped at the 83rd floor.

With one forceful shove, Emily pushed her out before quickly closing the doors.

An icy chill ran down Sophia's spine.

This was the beginning of the viral video.

In the surveillance footage, her drunken figure staggered down the hallway.

Six gangsters closed in around her.

Sophia's breathing turned ragged.

On screen, she was completely surrounded, crouching on the floor.

Then suddenly—she burst through the crowd—
###Chapter 396

Sophia Laurent stumbled free from the gangster's grasp.

Alcohol blurred her vision, but survival instinct drove her forward.

Shouts and chaotic footsteps echoed behind her.

She careened around a corridor corner and collided with a solid chest.

The faint scent of cedar drifted from the black suit.

"Sorry..." she slurred, making no move to pull away.

The man didn't push her off.

Crude curses erupted from the approaching gangsters.

"You bitch think you can run? I'll teach you a lesson tonight!"

Sophia trembled, fingers tightening around the man's sleeve.

"Help me..."

The man seemed drunk too. Her tug made him press fingers to his temple.

The gangsters closed in.

"Who's this pretty boy? Get lost!"

Someone shoved the man roughly.

He lifted his head slowly.

Dark eyes burned with terrifying ferocity.

Sophia's breath caught.

The man on screen was unmistakably Alexander Valdemar beside her.

"That night...it was you?" She turned in disbelief. "Why were you there?"

Alexander's expression darkened.

"More than just coincidence," he murmured.

On screen, the gangster's vulgar threat cut off as Alexander seized his wrist.

A swift judo throw slammed the man onto the floor.

Five others charged forward.

"Take out this meddling bastard first!"

Amid the chaos, Alexander moved with lethal precision.

But Sophia noticed his unsteady footing, the sweat beading at his temples.

Soon all five gangsters lay moaning on the ground.

Alexander braced against the wall, breathing ragged.
###Chapter 397

The gangsters lay sprawled on the ground, groaning in pain.

Alexander Valdemar didn't even glance at them as he strode forward.

Sophia Laurent peeked out from the corner. Seeing him leave, she hurried after him.

"Ah!"

A grimy hand suddenly seized her ankle.

Alexander whirled around and kicked the hand away.

Trembling, Sophia clutched his sleeve.

Like a frightened rabbit, she followed him into the hotel suite.

The surveillance footage froze on the moment the door closed.

Sophia stared at her phone screen, fingers shaking slightly.

So that night...

She had willingly followed Alexander into the room?

Her mind went blank.

"I'm sorry."

Alexander's voice was rough. "I was drugged that night."

His Adam's apple bobbed. "I hurt you."

Sophia lowered her lashes. "It wasn't entirely your fault."

She only remembered scorching breaths and the soreness that wracked her body the next morning.

At the time, she'd thought it was just a hangover.

"Why did you leave early?"

"Company emergency." Alexander's eyes darkened. "When I returned, you were already gone."

He paused. "The surveillance footage had been deleted."

"These videos..."

"I had the hotel's system restored." Alexander met her gaze directly. "To find you."

Sophia's ears burned.

In her panic, she hadn't left any contact information behind.

"Take the footage." Alexander's voice softened slightly. "It can clear your name."

Sophia murmured her thanks.

Only the hum of the air conditioner filled the room.

"Can we not divorce?"

Alexander's sudden question made Sophia's cheeks flush. She inched away.

"If it's just a contractual marriage..."

She heard herself say, "Then...we can reconsider."
###Chapter 398

Sophia Laurent knew all too well that her relationship with Alexander Valdemar was far from intimate.

His refusal to divorce stemmed partly from business interests tied to Valdemar Holdings.

The other reason likely involved the unexpected child growing inside her.

She never imagined this baby would be Alexander's.

Under these circumstances, maintaining their contractual marriage seemed reasonable.

Alexander's tense expression softened at her response.

"Let me handle the online controversy?" His deep voice resonated near her ear.

Sophia met his penetrating gaze and nodded. "Alright. Thank you."

The shadows lifted from his brow. "My responsibility."

Straightening his suit sleeves, he stood. "Shall we proceed to the hospital?"

This was their scheduled prenatal appointment—the real reason he'd been waiting.

Sophia reached for her handbag. "Let's go."

In the suite's living room, Ethan Winston sat with stormy eyes.

Gavin Winslow fidgeted beside him, worry etching his features.

The opening door drew their attention.

Alexander and Sophia emerged side by side—one aristocratic and imposing, the other radiantly beautiful. A painfully perfect match.

Ethan's breath hitched.

The atmosphere between them had shifted dramatically since they'd entered the room. Gone was the previous distance, replaced by unspoken harmony.

"Sophia, have you decided?" Ethan's gaze burned into her, disregarding propriety.

"I'll accompany you to the hospital."

Before Sophia could respond, Alexander stepped between them.

"Mind your place, Ethan." His voice could freeze molten steel.

Ethan clenched his fists, childhood deference toward his cousin dissolving into resentment.

"Three years together isn't something you just erase." His eyes reddened. "I won't abandon her."

Alexander studied his cousin's obsessive demeanor with narrowed eyes.

"She's my wife." Each word carried finality. "My family affairs require no interference."

Ethan laughed abruptly, the sound bordering on hysteria.

"If you cared, you'd convince her to abort that bastard!"

Alexander grasped Sophia's wrist, turning away with a parting remark: "We're keeping the baby."

Ethan froze, staring at their retreating figures in disbelief.

Madness.

Alexander had clearly lost his mind!

In the hotel's underground parking lot, Daniel Lowell slumped against his car seat.
###Chapter 399

Sophia Laurent's poised figure at the judges' panel lingered in Daniel Lowell's mind.

He sat conspicuously in the front row, yet failed to earn even a glance from her.

When the final results were announced, his design was unsurprisingly eliminated.

Without Gavin Winslow's covert assistance this time, his work paled in comparison to the thirty winning pieces.

The realization struck Daniel with brutal clarity—his position at Versini Couture had always depended on Sophia's protection.

Sitting in the driver's seat, he felt like a blunt knife was sawing through his heart. His fingers trembled uncontrollably.

She was his blood sister, yet he'd been the one to push her away.

Online discussions about Emily Lowell's leaked video continued spreading like wildfire.

Though the trending tag disappeared, the scandal remained common knowledge across social platforms.

Victoria Lowell nearly fainted watching footage of Sophia surrounded by gangsters. "How could this happen... My Sophia..."

Emily gently patted her back. "Don't blame yourself, Mother. This wasn't sister's fault—"

"Promise me you'll never drink in public!" Victoria clutched Emily's hand desperately.

"I never touch alcohol," Emily replied sweetly.

Richard Lowell's face darkened. "Of course it's her fault! Only a drunken fool would attract such disgrace!"

The Lowell family's already tattered reputation had been obliterated.

"She brought this upon herself."

Emily's lips curled briefly before she adopted a concerned expression. "Father, sister just made a momentary mistake—"

Richard's fury escalated. "I never should have acknowledged that disgrace as my daughter!"

Daniel entered to this exact scene—his father raging, his mother weeping, Emily offering hollow consolation.

"Daniel's home!" Emily rushed to greet him with false delight.

He acknowledged her with a tired nod.

"Did you know sister is Versini's chief designer? Now you'll have someone looking out for you at work," Emily simpered.

Daniel's expression hardened.

His icy glare silenced Emily mid-sentence as he moved toward the staircase.

"Stop right there!" Richard barked. "What's with this attitude?"

Daniel paused, his smile dripping with sarcasm. "My sister? Isn't Sophia my real sister?"

Had their lives not been swapped all those years ago, they wouldn't have been separated for decades.

They wouldn't have ended up like this.
###Chapter 400

Richard Lowell glared at Daniel's mocking expression. He grabbed the purple clay teapot from the coffee table and hurled it at him.

"How dare you! Who taught you to speak to your elders like that?"

The teapot grazed Daniel's temple, leaving a bloody gash.

He remained motionless, his piercing gaze locked onto his father.

"Was I wrong?"

The only sister he acknowledged was Sophia Laurent.

Not that cuckoo bird who stole her nest.

Victoria Lowell stamped her feet anxiously, tears welling in her eyes.

"Must you fight at a time like this?"

With Sophia's fate still unknown, these two were already at each other's throats.

"Daniel, let Uncle Wang take you to the hospital."

She tugged at her husband's sleeve. "He's grieving. Don't provoke him further."

"Hmph!"

Richard shook off his wife's hand. "If they were all as sensible as Emily, would I need to lose my temper?"

"River Banquet" was about to premiere, elevating Emily Lowell's status.

Even better, Ryan Cunningham was utterly devoted to her, with Cunningham Group extending frequent olive branches.

At recent business galas, who didn't envy Richard for having such an accomplished daughter?

Compare that to his sons:

William Lowell drowning in corporate affairs;

Nathan Lowell drowning his sorrows in alcohol;

Christopher Lowell still running around for Sophia's sake;

And now Daniel's disgraceful behavior.

Thank goodness for Emily, their adopted daughter, maintaining the family's dignity.

As long as she brought benefits to the Lowells, what did it matter if she was adopted?

Victoria's expression wavered at his words.

She sighed heavily, worry etching her features.

"That girl this time... she's probably ruined for good."

Regardless of the truth, the internet had already sentenced Sophia to social death.

They called her shameless, said she deserved her suffering.

More vicious were the curses—

Claiming a gangster's bastard should miscarry to spare society the trouble.

Emily lowered her head to hide her smirk, her voice trembling with fake tears.

"Mom, netizens have short attention spans... If sister just lays low for a while..."

Victoria patted her hand. "What else can we do..."

＊

Meanwhile, Henry Chamberlain's investigative report lay on his desk.

"Mr. Chamberlain, 'Star Express' released the initial video. They specialize in celebrity scandals for clicks."

"Though infamous in the industry, they've broken enough true stories to amass a substantial following."

"When our legal team showed up, they panicked and immediately revealed their backer."

"All evidence points to Emily Lowell's personal assistant."

In other words, Emily was the architect of this cyberbullying campaign.

Henry closed the file. "Do we have all the evidence?"

Mr. Valdemar had just called—it was time to spring the trap.

His assistant handed over a USB drive. "Complete chat logs. Ironclad proof."
###Chapter 401

Alexander Valdemar's slender fingers tapped twice on the desk, his gaze icy.

"Notify the PR department. Immediate action."

Three hours later, the fabricated videos of Sophia Laurent's alleged pregnancy with six gangsters had reached a boiling point online.

Anti-fans and internet trolls flooded Sophia's social media platforms. Her supporters' defenses were drowned out instantly by the tsunami of hate.

Just as public opinion seemed irreversibly against her, Valdemar Group's official account released a statement.

#Official Statement: Forensic analysis confirms the video is maliciously doctored. The child Ms. Laurent carries is Alexander Valdemar's biological heir. Legal action will be pursued against defamers.#

Attached was the complete surveillance footage, clearly revealing the truth of that day.

Trolls swarmed to attack again—only to fall silent after watching the evidence.

Sophia's fans mobilized instantly, spreading the statement across all platforms.

#Truth revealed!#

I knew that video looked off! Sophia has a teardrop mole by her right eye—the woman in the clip didn't!

Alexander defending his wife like a boss! Relationship goals!

How's that crow taste, haters?

The public finally understood.

Sophia was framed?

That's Alexander Valdemar's baby? No wonder she radiates elegance!

We owe you an apology, Sophia!

The tide began to turn. Many silently deleted their previous insults, replacing them with remorse.

The deepfake was terrifyingly realistic. Even professional tools couldn't detect it.

Whoever did this wanted to destroy Sophia.

She's pregnant—what if the stress harms her?

Panicked fans rushed to Sophia's account.

We're so sorry! We'll always stand with you!

Stay strong, Sophia! We've got your back!

Expose the mastermind!

Fury quickly turned toward Summit News, the outlet that first published the video.

Disgusting media! Selling lies for clicks!

Summit News must answer for this!

The deputy editor-in-chief stared at his screen, forehead glistening with sweat.

"Should we really reveal who paid us?"
###Chapter 402

The general manager stomped his foot in frustration. "Tell me, what other options do we have?"

As media professionals, they knew exactly which stories could ignite public outrage.

Though Emily Lowell wasn't biologically related to the Lowells, she enjoyed their unwavering affection.

Not only had she landed the lead role in Richard Lowell's big-budget drama "Imperial Feast," but recent rumors also suggested an arranged marriage with the Cunningham family. By all appearances, she was living a charmed life.

Emily's current status was something ordinary people could never hope to achieve.

Yet despite the Cunninghams' wealth, they still paled in comparison to the Valdemars.

When Henry Chamberlain arrived with the legal task force, the general manager immediately reached a decision.

"Issue an apology statement immediately. Expose the mastermind behind this."

The deputy general manager sighed. "It's our only choice."

What a shame to lose such a lucrative client like Emily.

She had always been generous—whether funding smear campaigns against rivals or promoting herself.

Just as netizens were speculating about the culprit, Summit News released an official statement.

#Summit News: We sincerely apologize to Ms. Sophia Laurent for publishing falsified footage.#

The announcement stunned the internet.

Good heavens! Summit News actually apologized!

This outlet had a notorious reputation but had never issued retractions before.

Alexander Valdemar must have intervened! That's the Valdemar power!

Amid the chatter, Summit News dropped another bombshell.

#Summit News: We were misled and hope for your understanding!#

Attached were screenshots of conversations with Emily's assistant, Chloe Preston.

Though no names were mentioned, netizens quickly connected the dots.

Isn't this Emily Lowell's assistant?

I recognize that profile picture! She once posted photos with Emily!

So Emily orchestrated the smear campaign against Sophia?

The speculation exploded across social media.

Don't jump to conclusions! Plenty of people share names and profile pictures! Even if the assistant was involved, it doesn't prove Emily's involvement...

Stop defending her! This absolutely reeks of Emily's involvement!

Netizens who had previously attacked Sophia now flooded Emily's social media accounts demanding answers.

At the Lowell estate...

Emily had just finished comforting Victoria Lowell and retreated to her room.

She had intended to relish Sophia's online humiliation.

But the moment she unlocked her phone, her inbox exploded.

Emily, did you doctor that footage? How could you be so vicious?

All that innocence and kindness was just an act!

Clear your name quickly! This has nothing to do with you!

...

Emily stared at the messages, momentarily stunned.

When she discovered Summit News's betrayal, her entire body went rigid.

Then she saw the unedited footage released by Valdemar Holdings.

"How... how is this possible?"

Stumbling to her computer, Emily pulled up the surveillance footage copied from the hotel.

This time, she watched every second without skipping.
###Chapter 403

The truth in the surveillance footage sent her into a complete meltdown.

She hurled the crystal pen holder on the desk to the ground with violent force. The glass shattered upon impact.

Sophia Laurent was actually carrying Alexander Valdemar's child?

That day, she had accidentally run into Alexander?

How?

How did Sophia always get so lucky?

Emily Lowell's chest heaved violently. Her nails dug deep into her palms. Twisted hatred churned in her eyes.

She thought she had finally grasped the leverage to ruin Sophia's life.

But it had all been for nothing.

Damn it!

Those gangsters had scammed her with a fake video.

Two million dollars for this joke.

Her hands trembled as she dialed the number. Her voice came out shrill and distorted. "You dare pass off a deepfake to me?"

A lazy chuckle came from the other end. "Worked well enough, didn't it?"

"I wanted the real thing!"

She wanted Sophia utterly destroyed, forced to live in shame forever.

Emily screamed hysterically, "Give me my money back!"

"Dreaming, Miss Lowell?"

The gangster smacked his lips obscenely. "No one spits out meat that's already in their mouth."

"This is fraud!"

"Then go call the cops."

The man laughed, utterly unbothered. "Let them investigate who hired us to assault her own sister."

The words struck like a poisoned dagger. Emily's vision darkened.

Long after the call ended, she remained rooted in place, shaking.

Her nails scraped against the solid wood desk, producing a grating sound.

This secret had to stay buried.

Otherwise, the Lowell family would be the first to make her pay.

Thinking of the escalating online backlash, Emily frantically tried to contact her assistant to take the fall.

Three calls went unanswered.

Gritting her teeth, she drafted the statement herself:

#Apology Statement Regarding Assistant's Unauthorized Release of False Video#

The moment she hit send, her phone buzzed.

A new notification popped up:

[Attorney Henry Chamberlain has arrived at Assistant Chen's residence. Defamation case materials prepared.]
###Chapter 404

Henry Chamberlain's lips curved into a perfectly polite smile, but his eyes held an unyielding pressure.

Chloe Preston bit her lower lip so hard it nearly bled. Her nails dug deep into her palms.

She had worked for Emily Lowell for five years—from a fresh graduate to a capable assistant.

Emily had treated her like a sister. Betraying that bond was unthinkable.

With "River Banquet" about to premiere, a scandal now would be catastrophic.

Just as Chloe resolved to protect Emily even at the cost of prison, Henry slid his phone toward her.

The screen displayed Emily's newly released statement.

Chloe's pupils constricted. Her fingers trembled uncontrollably.

The person she was willing to sacrifice everything for had just thrown her to the wolves.

Henry adjusted his cuffs with deliberate calm.

"Miss Preston, do you still think it's worth it?"

The statement had destroyed Chloe's career.

After being fired by Lowell Entertainment, no one in the industry would touch her.

Her face turned deathly pale. A chill seeped into her bones.

Since college, she had dreamed of becoming an elite agent, starting humbly as an assistant.

Now, the person she trusted most had ruined her future.

A glint of calculation flashed in Henry's eyes.

"Since Miss Preston insists on going to prison..."

He turned as if to leave.

Chloe's hands slammed against the table.

"I'll do it!"

Her voice was hoarse, barely recognizable.

Henry paused.

The internet had exploded.

Emily's statement drew waves of skepticism, but her fans clung to it like a lifeline.

This is so fake. Do they think we're stupid?

Emily already clarified. What more do you want?

Maybe the assistant had a crush on Alexander and framed Emily!

Exactly! Emily would never do something like this!

Henry had anticipated this.

The video he'd leaked earlier had carefully omitted Ethan Winston and Emily's involvement.

Now, he had Chloe's testimony.

#Valdemar Group Official: Emily Lowell, we await your response#
###Chapter 405

Valdemar Holdings suddenly issued an official statement.

The video link attached at the end immediately caught everyone's attention.

Netizens who were busy arguing with Emily Lowell's fans clicked on it without hesitation.

The footage clearly showed what happened after that fateful banquet.

Ethan Winston supported a staggering Sophia Laurent out of the elevator.

Emily Lowell took Sophia from Ethan's arms.

The video ended abruptly at this point.

The comment section exploded.

"My God! Sophia was deliberately abandoned on the 83rd floor by Emily!"

"Those thugs called her 'Miss Lowell' the moment they saw her. They knew exactly who she was!"

"Rich family feuds are this vicious? Emily wanted to ruin Sophia!"

"Thank goodness Alexander Valdemar showed up in time..."

Speculations grew wilder.

Some directly accused Emily of hiring those gangsters.

This theory made everyone gasp in horror.

But Emily's loyal fans kept defending her.

"How dare you slander Emily for helping? This was clearly the hotel's fault!"

"The Lowells always favored Emily. Why would she do this?"

"Some people just can't stand seeing Emily succeed!"

As the debate raged on, a bombshell dropped.

Chloe Preston, Emily's assistant, made a public statement.

"Emily ordered me to leak that video to the media."

Her simple declaration came with complete chat logs and call recordings.

Irrefutable evidence.

Public opinion shifted instantly.

"Still defending her? How's that crow taste?"

"How evil! She wanted to destroy Sophia's life!"

"What a disgrace to the Lowell name!"

"How can 'River Banquet' keep employing such a toxic actress?"

The hashtag #EmilyLowellIsEvil skyrocketed to the top of trending topics.

Outraged netizens flooded the social media accounts of every Lowell family member.

The official Weibo account of "River Banquet" got swarmed with angry comments.
###Chapter 406

Richard Lowell had been riding high lately. His passion project "River Banquet" was about to hit theaters.

This film carried the hopes of Lowell Entertainment's comeback.

He was reviewing promotional materials in his office when his assistant burst in.

"Director Lowell, we have an emergency!"

Richard frowned. "What's so urgent?"

"Miss Emily's scandal just broke!"

Richard's stomach dropped. "What happened?"

"It's all over the internet... You should see for yourself..."

The assistant handed over a tablet displaying Emily Lowell's damaging headlines alongside a joint statement from Valdemar Group and Chloe Preston.

"Director, what do we do?"

With the film's promotion imminent, a lead actress scandal spelled disaster.

Richard felt his temples throbbing.

It took him five full minutes to process the information.

Sophia was pregnant?

With Alexander Valdemar's child?

That girl had actually climbed her way into the Valdemar family?

No.

He shook his head sharply.

Emily's crisis took priority now.

Snatching his assistant's phone, he dialed Sophia's number.

"Hello?"

Hearing his daughter's calm voice, Richard barked, "Sophia! Must you destroy your sister? Get Valdemar Group to retract that statement immediately. Come home for dinner tonight—don't air our dirty laundry in public—"

Sophia had just finished her prenatal checkup. She laughed coldly. "Richard, stop pretending. My relationship with Emily is a hundred times worse than whatever's online."

Richard exploded. "Sophia! I'm your father! You'll do as I say!"

"Sorry, I'm an orphan. No parents. Don't call again."

As Sophia moved to hang up, Alexander suddenly stopped her.

Richard's enraged screams continued through the receiver: "You wretched bastard! I should've let you die at the butcher's! A slut like you deserves—"

The tirade cut off abruptly.

An arctic voice came through the line: "So this is how Director Lowell speaks of my wife."

The tone carried such lethal chill it seemed to freeze the airwaves.

Richard's face drained of color.

He never imagined Alexander would be with Sophia.

The Valdemar Group CEO had just awoken—why was he accompanying her?

"M-Mr. Valdemar..."

Alexander's voice could have flash-frozen hell: "Since Director Lowell holds my wife in such contempt, consider this your last communication."
###Chapter 407

Sophia Laurent had long severed ties with the Lowell family. Yet Lowell Entertainment continued profiting in business circles by flaunting their connection to the Valdemars through marriage.

The Valdemars turned a blind eye out of respect for Sophia.

Even Patriarch Valdemar, who openly expressed his disdain for Richard Lowell, never actually took action against them.

Richard broke into a cold sweat at Alexander's voice. "Son-in-law, this is all a misunderstanding—" His tone instantly turned ingratiating.

"When you were comatose, I insisted on marrying my daughter to you despite opposition. Now that you've just woken up, you must be busy..."

"Why don't you bring Sophia home for dinner sometime?"

"Unnecessary." Alexander's voice was glacial. "Stop calling me your son-in-law. Sophia has cut ties with you. Don't harass her again."

The final words carried an unmistakable warning.

He had been studying Sophia's expression.

Though outwardly composed, she was usually gentle in her interactions. Now her furrowed brows and tense jawline betrayed deep irritation.

Alexander snatched the phone.

Verbal warnings weren't enough—the Lowells needed tangible consequences. Bullies only learned through punishment.

Sophia looked up at Alexander.

His slender fingers gripped her pink phone, veins faintly visible beneath pale skin. His protective stance stirred something unexpected in her chest.

He ended the call and returned her phone.

Sophia's dark eyes glittered as she met his gaze.

Alexander softened.

"Your phone." His voice gentled. "Sorry for interfering."

He hadn't realized how mistreated Sophia had been. Richard's casual verbal abuse suggested a long-standing pattern.

A flicker of心疼 crossed Alexander's eyes.

Sophia suddenly laughed.

"Thank you," she said sincerely. Though the Lowells' malice no longer affected her, being defended felt...nice.

Alexander's lips curved. "You're my wife. Protecting you is my duty."

Her heartbeat stuttered.

She quickly looked away.

A charged silence settled between them.

Then her phone rang again.

"Sophia, 'Empress' is wrapping up. Will you attend the promotional events?" Director Lucas Sheridan's cheerful voice came through.
###Chapter 408

Sophia Laurent's online popularity was skyrocketing, rivaling A-list celebrities. Her meteoric rise even tempted Lucas Sheridan.

"Just local events. I promise it won't be exhausting..."

Sophia fell silent for a moment.

Lucas's coaxing tone, laced with amusement, made it hard to refuse.

Thinking of the movie profit shares, she nodded. "Fine. Send me the details."

"Right away!" Lucas's voice trembled with excitement.

Richard Lowell stared at the disconnected call, his mind blank.

When he regained his composure, his expression darkened dangerously.

He immediately summoned his assistants and PR team to contain Emily Lowell's scandal.

With "River Banquet" about to premiere, he couldn't afford any mishaps.

The first step was denying Chloe Preston's accusations. They had to insist it was revenge for her termination.

As for the video Valdemar Group leaked, Emily would claim ignorance—Sophia had instructed her to deliver it to the 83rd floor.

After issuing the statement, they'd hire internet trolls to muddy the waters.

If they denied everything stubbornly, netizens would move on soon enough.

The trending topics didn't worry him. Infamy was still fame.

True to form, the statement ignited a firestorm.

"Is this guy for real?"

"Do they think we're idiots?"

"The Lowells are a family of hypocrites!"

Faced with overwhelming ridicule, Richard could only feign deafness while secretly deleting comments.

In just days, he seemed to have aged a decade.

Now he loathed Sophia with a vengeance.

So Emily's scheme against her didn't bother him.

At the "River Banquet" premiere, he personally vouched for Emily.

"Emily has always been kind-hearted. She'd never harm anyone."

Dressed in white with teary eyes, Emily's fragile demeanor won sympathy.

Richard's endorsement became her fans' strongest weapon. The show's followers joined the fray.

Overnight, Emily's popularity surged, and "River Banquet" gained traction.

"If Director Lowell says so, there must be more to the story!"

"Sophia's just a nobody chasing clout!"

"Poor Emily!"
###Chapter 409

Stop wasting time here. Go help promote Director Richard and Emily's new drama.

"River Banquet," the highly anticipated collaboration between internationally acclaimed director Richard Lowell and rising star Emily Lowell, promises to be this year's most breathtaking visual spectacle!

...

On the set of "Empress," Adrian Valdemar stared at the live promotional stream of "River Banquet" on his phone, veins throbbing at his temples.

"That old man has no shame!"

His teeth clenched, knuckles cracking under the force of his grip.

"Emily's mediocre skills don't deserve Sophia's support. Who's riding whose coattails here?"

Scarlett Ashcroft gently tapped his shoulder, offering a glass of water.

"Calm down. We're up soon."

The entire "Empress" crew had poured their hearts into this project.

She and Adrian had bonded over their shared dedication on set—a group of artists who treated acting as life itself.

At the stage cue, Adrian's eyes lit up.

If Richard could publicly prop up Emily while undermining Sophia, why couldn't he retaliate?

No rules against speaking the truth.

Adjusting his collar, Adrian strode confidently toward the spotlight.

He completely missed Sophia Laurent slipping into the back row, oversized sunglasses obscuring her face.

Since the pregnancy scandal broke, he'd avoided facing her.

But the press instantly spotted the unexpected guest.

Gasps rippled through the venue.

Today was "Empress'" promotional event—Sophia's sudden appearance as an outsider sent shockwaves through the crowd.

After a stunned beat, camera flashes erupted like fireworks.

This marked Sophia's first public appearance since the pregnancy rumors surfaced.

The atmosphere electrified.

Director Lucas Sheridan fought back a grin.

Sophia's star power was undeniable.

With her presence, she could dominate the entertainment industry effortlessly.

Pity she was genuine aristocracy—born with golden opportunities most could only dream of.

"Thank you all for coming. Unlike traditional female-led dramas, 'Empress' meticulously crafts every detail to..."

Lucas launched into the film's unique features.

Though journalists itched to question Sophia, they dutifully took notes.

The box office battle between "Empress" and "River Banquet" had become the season's hottest topic.

Ever since Lucas and Richard's public feud, the rivalry had escalated dramatically.

Richard's fans viciously attacked Lucas, dismissing him as an unqualified reality TV director dabbling in cinema.

Lucas' supporters had swallowed their fury long enough.
###Chapter 410

The press conference was ablaze with flashing cameras as journalists wrapped up their interview with director Lucas Sheridan.

The creative team of "Empress" took turns facing the media.

When Adrian Valdemar's turn came, a reporter fired a pointed question: "Many doubt your ability to portray the complex role of the Young Marquis. What's your response?"

Adrian's slender fingers tapped lightly on the table.

"The Lowell family isn't just blind and ignorant—they're downright despicable. They don't deserve to be called human."

The room plunged into stunned silence.

The female reporter's hand trembled, nearly dropping her microphone.

Director Sheridan choked on a sudden cough.

In the corner, Sophia Laurent's eyes widened.

This direct attack caught everyone off guard.

Though industry insiders knew of Sheridan's feud with Richard Lowell, such a public naming-and-shaming was unprecedented.

Live stream comments exploded in real time.

The reporter hesitantly reminded him, "Mr. Valdemar, this is being broadcast live nationwide..."

Her hint couldn't be clearer.

Adrian merely smirked. "Just speaking the truth."

He returned to the original question: "I'll answer doubts with my performance. The audience will judge when the film releases."

His words only fueled more interest.

"You seem very confident in your acting?" someone pressed.

Adrian's gaze softened unexpectedly.

"I owe that to one person."

His voice lowered. "When I was at my lowest, she pulled me back from the abyss."

Under the spotlight, the young man's sincerity shone through.

"A lover?" The reporter sniffed out gossip.

Adrian shook his head instantly. "My current boss."

He omitted Sophia's other identity.

"Pearl Group's CEO Sophia Laurent?"

Adrian nodded with a smile, his eyes unconsciously searching the crowd.

Reporters followed his gaze.

At the periphery stood Sophia in a cream-white dress, massaging her temples in resignation.
###Chapter 411

The press conference hall buzzed with flashing cameras. Adrian Valdemar's gaze froze the moment it landed on Sophia Laurent.

His fingers unconsciously clenched the hem of his suit jacket. His Adam's apple bobbed.

A reporter suddenly thrust a microphone toward him. "Mr. Valdemar, do you have anything to say to Ms. Laurent?"

The tips of Adrian's ears burned red.

Ever since learning the truth—that he had drugged Alexander at that banquet, indirectly causing Sophia's pregnancy—every encounter with her left him on edge.

"I..." His voice caught in his throat.

Sophia arched a brow, her dark eyes gleaming under the spotlights.

"Seems like Mr. Valdemar has a lot to say?" She chuckled.

Adrian hastily averted his gaze, a sheen of sweat forming on the back of his neck.

"Everyone... should pursue their dreams." The words tumbled out stiffly. He wished he could bite his tongue off.

The room erupted in good-natured laughter.

#AdrianValdemarPublicConfession
#EmpressCastVisualPerfection
The trending list was instantly flooded.

Netizens' comments poured in like a tidal wave:
"That look from Adrian! Textbook unrequited love!"
"Queen Sophia radiating dominance! Obsessed!"
"Just for these visuals, I'm locking in 'Empress'!"

Richard Lowell's fans immediately retaliated:
"Pure publicity stunt!"
"What does 'Empress' have besides pretty faces?"
"Waiting for 'River Banquet' to crush it!"

The moment the conference ended, Adrian bolted backstage like a startled rabbit.

"Stop."

Sophia's voice rooted him to the spot.

She approached slowly, her heels clicking sharply against the floor.

"Are you avoiding me?" She tilted her head slightly.

Adrian's lashes fluttered wildly. "N-no..."

"Then why won't you look at me?"

Silence thickened the air.

Adrian's throat moved again.

Sophia suddenly placed a hand on his shoulder. "I told you, you can trust me."

His head snapped up, a flicker of hope in his eyes. "What if... what if I did something terrible?"

"How terrible?"

"Like..." His voice dwindled to a whisper. "Making someone pregnant..."

Sophia narrowed her eyes.

Adrian hastily clarified, "Not me! Someone else! I just helped!"

The backstage lights cast uneven shadows across his face.

Sophia suddenly laughed. "You don't mean the Alexander incident, do you?"

Adrian's expression petrified.
###Chapter 412

Adrian Valdemar shook his head frantically at Sophia Laurent's question.

"That's...not true at all."

He wouldn't dare admit to drugging his elder brother—such an unthinkable act.

He immediately tried to make his escape.

Sophia arched a brow, watching his flustered retreat.

"Oh, and the Patriarch's birthday banquet is next Sunday. Don't forget to return to the manor on time."

Adrian waved without turning back.

"Got it!"

Meanwhile, Richard Lowell was clinking glasses with investors for "Imperial Feast."

Despite two casting controversies, the film's popularity had only soared.

"Director Lowell, your talent never fades!"

"Come, let's toast to Director Lowell!"

The investors, faces flushed, raised their glasses.

By riding on Sophia's fame, Richard had saved a fortune on promotions.

"You flatter me."

Though his words were modest, his eyes gleamed with calculation.

Did Sophia really think bringing in Lucas Sheridan could turn the tables?

In his eyes, she was nothing but a ridiculous clown.

"Richard, about your daughter..."

One investor couldn't resist sighing.

"To throw away such a good match with the Valdemars..."

At the mention of the Valdemars, the room buzzed with interest.

"If Emily had married into that family..."

Richard swirled his wine glass.

"Every cloud has a silver lining."

He cast a meaningful glance at Emily Lowell beside him.

Ryan Cunningham had been making frequent overtures lately—a union between their families was imminent.

Though the Cunninghams couldn't compare to the Valdemars, their reputation was impeccable.

"Miss Lowell, could it be...?"

The investors instantly caught the hint.

Emily blushed furiously.

"Dad!"

Richard laughed heartily.

"Soon, very soon."

The group exchanged knowing looks.

"Could it be the young master of the Cunningham family?"
###Chapter 413

"Director Lowell, what a fortunate man you are!" The investor raised his glass with an ingratiating smile.

Under the crystal chandelier, Richard Lowell stood impeccably dressed in his tailored suit, his face glowing with satisfaction.

"Your film is about to dominate the box office, and both your daughters have found excellent matches. You're truly living the dream!"

Amidst the clinking of glasses, the guests took turns toasting Richard.

Suddenly, his assistant rushed over in a fluster, whispering urgently into his ear.

Richard's smile froze.

"Is everything alright?" The investor beside him immediately noticed the shift in mood.

"Nothing important." Richard forced a tight-lipped smile.

"Look at this!" someone suddenly exclaimed. "Someone from the 'Empress' crew is publicly insulting Director Lowell in a livestream!"

The private room fell silent.

"Is it Sophia again?" someone muttered under their breath.

"No," the person clarified, shaking their head. "It's that young actor playing the Marquis's son."

The investors immediately pulled out their phones to search for the video.

Richard's expression darkened with each passing second.

"Don't take it to heart, Director Lowell," someone quickly interjected. "A nobody like that can easily be blacklisted."

"Exactly! Teach him what happens when he crosses you!"

Richard gave a bitter laugh. "It's fine. He's one of Sophia's artists."

He knew Adrian Valdemar's true identity—the second son of the Valdemar Group.

"You're too soft-hearted, Director Lowell," someone grumbled indignantly. "If it were me, I'd have cut ties with that ungrateful daughter long ago!"

"And Lucas Sheridan—throwing away a perfectly good variety show just to oppose you."

"He's probably trying to curry favor with the Valdemars. Just wait until 'Empress' flops. Let's see how he handles that!"

Richard's expression finally relaxed.

He could already envision "River Banquet" sweeping the box office and shining at film festivals.

Both films had garnered attention from the moment they were announced.

"River Banquet" boasted a golden production team and an all-star cast.

"Empress," on the other hand, was helmed by a rookie director and starred controversial figures.

On the eve of their releases, industry insiders overwhelmingly doubted "Empress."
###Chapter 414

The two films premiered as scheduled, unaffected by online controversies.

Emily Lowell's fan army demonstrated astonishing dedication on opening day.

"River Banquet" grossed thirty million on its first day, exceeding studio expectations.

Champagne was already chilling for the celebration.

Yet theatergoers emerged with conflicted expressions.

This historical time-travel drama promised a strong female lead—a modern woman reborn as a general's daughter.

The protagonist preached equality while constantly relying on male protection.

Onscreen, Emily appeared in lavish costumes, every frame polished to perfection.

Her battlefield scenes featured immaculate makeup, each strand of hair gleaming like pearls.

Audiences groaned when the male lead took an arrow for her.

The finale showed the heroine ascending the throne with the third prince.

"Is this what they call feminist storytelling?" one viewer tweeted.

Comments exploded:
"A strong female lead who climbs the ladder through men?"
"Any pretty face could've played this role."
"High heels in battle? Do writers even research warfare?"

Modern audiences have grown weary of Mary Sues disguised as empowered women.

Both "River Banquet" and "Empress" had marketed themselves as female empowerment stories.

Now the former's facade crumbled, disappointing viewers.

"Skip 'Empress' tomorrow."
"Local writers don't understand strong heroines."

Such comments flooded social media.

The film's 3.2 rating on opening day humiliated the producers.

Even this dismal score relied on fan-driven inflation.
###Chapter 415
Box Office Battle

"Empress" and "River Banquet" premiered on the same day, but met vastly different fates.

Lucas Sheridan stood in the theater's back office, staring at the real-time box office figures. The screen flashed a disappointing nine million, paling in comparison to "River Banquet's" thirty million.

He absently rubbed the torn movie ticket stub between his fingers.

Ten years ago, he'd been a rookie director full of dreams. With no investors or resources, he'd scraped by making cheap B-movies. Eventually forced out of the industry, he'd switched to producing variety shows.

But the dream never died.

Over the years, he'd networked at every major film festival, befriending countless industry elites. When Gavin Croix handed him the "Empress" script, he knew his moment had arrived.

"Director Sheridan, should we ramp up promotions?" his assistant asked tentatively.

Lucas shook his head. "Let the work speak for itself."

He'd just finished watching "River Banquet." Lavish CGI and an all-star cast couldn't disguise its hollow plot.

By evening, the first wave of audience reviews began flooding online forums.

"Girls, drop everything and watch 'Empress'! I went through three tissues during Scarlett's war campaign scene!"

"Finally, a true female-led epic! No damsel-in-distress tropes—just grit and leadership!"

The comment section erupted.

"Paid shills? What could a nobody director possibly deliver?"

"A female emperor? Probably another 'sleep her way to the top' cliché."

Amid the skepticism, more viewers rallied to defend the film.

"Scarlett rescuing flood victims gave me chills! She literally jumped into raging waters!"

"That armor-clad battle scene? She outshone every male action star!"

A faint smile touched Lucas's lips as he scrolled.

His time had come at last.
###Chapter 416

"Empress" had a modest box office opening but received overwhelming critical acclaim.

Major film review sites unanimously awarded it a stellar 4.8 rating, stunning the industry.

"Scarlett Ashcroft's commanding presence as the ruthless empress is breathtaking!"

"From obscurity to the throne—this is how a true female lead should be written!"

"The battle scenes are so realistic they gave me chills!"

Social media exploded with organic praise from viewers.

Sophia Laurent and Lucas Sheridan's team didn't even need to spend on marketing—the film dominated trending topics effortlessly.

Beyond Scarlett Ashcroft's brilliant performance, the veteran actors' portrayals also sparked heated discussions.

The biggest surprise was Adrian Valdemar's redemption arc.

Previously, Adrian was Hollywood's notorious "pariah."

Divas antics, cringe-worthy acting, plastic surgery rumors...

Damian Valdemar's controlled media outlets had spent years smearing him.

Without a PR team, Adrian could only defend himself online, drowning in troll attacks.

Netizens mentioned his name with scorn and mockery.

"Get out of Hollywood!" flooded his social media comments.

When "Empress" announced Adrian's casting as the young marquis, Lucas Sheridan's fans revolted.

But Lucas stood firm.

Now, Adrian's performance left audiences stunned.

"This is the same Adrian who couldn't act his way out of a rom-com?"

"He completely brought the spoiled-then-brilliant young marquis to life!"

"Who said he had a plastic face? Those close-ups are flawless!"

"That final battlefield glance? Chilling perfection!"

Lying in bed scrolling through reviews, Adrian couldn't suppress his grin.

The taste of an underdog victory? Sweet.

Meanwhile, Damian Valdemar glared at his phone screen, face darkening.

Valdemar Entertainment should've been his inheritance, yet Sebastian Valdemar controlled it.

His years of sabotaging Adrian were meant to destroy the bastard.

Ideally driving him to suicide.

But now...

Damian clenched his fists, eyes flashing with venom.

He wouldn't let Adrian rise.
###Chapter 417

Valdemar Entertainment's marketing accounts launched another coordinated attack.

A flood of malicious posts inundated the internet.

#AdrianValdemar'sWoodenActing
#AdrianValdemarTyrantOnSet
#AdrianValdemarBotchedPlasticSurgery

These targeted posts instantly dominated trending lists across all platforms.

But this time, the public reaction was completely different.

The hit drama "Empress" had showcased Adrian's transformative acting skills. His portrayal of the general was mesmerizing, with every glance radiating intensity. Even the harshest critics couldn't find flaws.

The plastic surgery accusations were downright ridiculous.

On screen, Adrian looked every inch the dashing nobleman with his chiseled features and snow-white robes. The so-called "botched surgery" photos were clearly malicious edits.

Netizens uncovered the truth:

His outburst was provoked by a crew member deliberately ruining 30+ takes
The assault allegation stemmed from him defending against sexual harassment
All smear campaigns coincided with his career breakthroughs
Public opinion flipped overnight.

"This was clearly an organized character assassination!"
"If Adrian's face is considered ugly, who in this industry qualifies as handsome?"
"We've all been manipulated!"

Outraged netizens began investigating the marketing accounts.

Their discovery shocked everyone - all these accounts belonged to Valdemar Entertainment.

"Why would an agency sabotage its own talent?"
"Wait...Adrian's last name is Valdemar!"
"The plot thickens - rich family drama?"

The internet exploded with speculation.

More explosive details emerged: Adrian was the Valdemar family's legitimate heir who'd cut ties to pursue acting. Vincent Valdemar, the agency's actual controller, was his half-brother.

"So this is sibling rivalry?"
"No wonder all the accusations were taken out of context!"
"Vincent's trying to destroy his own brother!"

As truth surfaced, ashamed netizens flooded Adrian's fan pages with apologies. Related hashtags gained a billion views overnight, crashing Weibo's servers.

At Valdemar Entertainment headquarters, Vincent smashed his eighth teacup.

"Keep buying those trending spots!"
"But sir...the public is..."
"I don't care! Bury him!"

Meanwhile, "Empress" ratings shattered annual records.

Adrian stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, his phone buzzing nonstop with notifications. A faint smile touched his lips as he blocked Vincent's latest call.
###Chapter 418

Adrian Valdemar scrolled through his phone, his fingers gliding over the trending topics list.

The familiar smear campaigns had flooded the platform again. His grip tightened around the device, knuckles turning white.

But this time, the public reaction took an unexpected turn.

Netizens dissected the situation with razor-sharp precision, exposing its inconsistencies.

Adrian's eyes reddened slightly as an unconscious smile tugged at his lips.

Meanwhile, online spectators began digging into Adrian's connection with the Valdemar family.

Someone unearthed footage from the "Empress" premiere where Adrian had publicly supported Sophia Laurent.

The comment section erupted instantly.

"Adrian, what's your real beef with the Valdemars?"

"Are you actually their long-lost illegitimate child or something?"

Adrian stared at his screen, barely restraining himself from punching through the bed frame.

Without hesitation, he fired back.

"The real bastard is here @Damian_Valdemar_CrownPrince"

The entertainment industry had always treated Valdemar affairs with hushed reverence.

Beyond Vincent Valdemar's carefully curated leaks, little genuine information about the family ever surfaced.

Though Damian Valdemar hadn't officially debuted, he'd leveraged his "Crown Prince" status to considerable advantage.

Those business photos with Vincent had cemented his position beyond doubt.

Adrian's direct attack detonated across social media.

"Seriously? The Crown Prince is illegitimate?"

"Has Adrian lost it? That's Old Valdemar's confirmed son!"

"Sophia is practically Damian's sister-in-law. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you."

Damian's fans swarmed the comments instantly.

But cooler heads prevailed among other netizens.

"Adrian wouldn't say this without proof."

"He knows better than to spread rumors about the Valdemars."

When Damian saw the notification, he hurled his phone against the wall.

Previously, he'd manipulated public opinion from the shadows, never drawing direct fire.

Now Adrian had openly challenged him.

For the first time in their rivalry, Damian found himself at a disadvantage.

Meanwhile, Adrian lounged on his bed, thoroughly satisfied.

"Empress" had become a critical darling, elevating his supporting role alongside it.

Pure satisfaction.

The next day's box office reports confirmed it—"Empress" shattered the 50 million mark.

Theaters scrambled to add screenings, every showing sold out.

Meanwhile, "River Banquet" floundered with dismal ticket sales, its rating plummeting to 3.1.

A tidal wave of negative reviews made its meager six million gross seem almost pitiful.
###Chapter 419

"Empress" continued to shine with glowing reviews.

Every major film review site was flooded with five-star ratings.

Industry insiders unanimously predicted this movie would shatter box office records.

The final numbers proved them right.

"Empress" grossed 3.6 billion, setting a new benchmark for historical dramas.

Meanwhile, "River Banquet" plummeted after its premiere.

It barely scraped together 180 million at the box office.

Richard Lowell had prided himself on lavish productions.

From costumes to actor salaries, no expense was spared.

A-list stars alone devoured most of the budget.

These dismal returns spelled financial ruin.

Investors bombarded his phone.

"Mr. Lowell, this is a catastrophic loss!"

"Wasn't 'Empress' originally offered to you?"

Richard's hand trembled around his phone.

He'd bragged about it at that ill-fated celebration.

Sophia had urged him to abandon "River Banquet," promising a superior script.

He'd congratulated himself for ignoring her.

How laughable that seemed now.

Lowell Entertainment, mired in scandal, had pinned its hopes on this film.

With its failure, the company sank into irrelevance.

And the architect of its downfall?

The daughter he'd disowned.

Strangely, he couldn't summon hatred.

The gulf between them had grown too vast.

Only awe remained.

Richard imagined an alternate reality.

What if he'd treated Sophia with kindness?

"Empress" bore Gavin Croix's name.

Had he not severed ties, that glory would be his.

3.6 billion.

The industry's pinnacle.

The mere thought made him dizzy.

Regret surged like a tidal wave, gnawing at his heart.

A metallic taste flooded his mouth.

Blood sprayed across his desk.

Darkness swallowed his vision as he collapsed.

"Richard!" Victoria's scream pierced the air.

Nathan and Daniel rushed in, frantically calling an ambulance.

Doctors ran tests at the hospital.

"Stress-induced syncope," the physician concluded. "No permanent damage."

Victoria dabbed her eyes with a tissue.

"Three days' observation recommended."

"Avoid emotional triggers after discharge."

She nodded vigorously. "We'll make sure of it."
###Chapter 420

Daniel and Nathan Lowell had been keeping to themselves, yet they couldn't escape the news about the box office gap between "River Banquet" and "Empress."

They stood in the hospital room in silence.

Images of Sophia Laurent filled their minds.

If only they had treated her better—even half as well as they treated Emily...

Nathan's music career wouldn't have plummeted.

Daniel wouldn't have lost his position at Versini Couture.

But what had they done?

They had hurt Sophia over and over, always siding with Emily.

Now karma had come for them.

Day and night, regret gnawed at their hearts.

Every time they closed their eyes, Sophia's face haunted them.

They reached out, only for her to vanish like mist.

The torment was driving them mad.

Even their patience with Emily had worn thin.

Victoria Lowell returned from seeing the doctor and sighed at her sons' despondent expressions.

She pulled out her phone to make a call.

"Mom, who are you calling?" Nathan frowned.

"Your father is hospitalized. Sophia and Emily should know."

Her tone was weary.

She hoped Sophia might soften at the news of her father's condition.

As for Emily...

"Your father adores her. Seeing her might lift his spirits."

Nathan and Daniel exchanged glances, a flicker of hope in their silence.

Would Sophia relent?

The first call went to Emily.

It rang endlessly before she picked up.

"Mom? What is it?"

"Your father is in the hospital. I'll send you the address."

Victoria hinted for her to come immediately.

"Mom, I'm with Ryan Cunningham right now. I might not be able to make it until tomorrow..."

Emily sounded hesitant.

The disastrous performance of "River Banquet" had shaken her most of all.

She knew Richard Lowell's favor was conditional.

Without value, she'd become the next Sophia.

Ryan was her last lifeline.

At the private club, Emily had dressed meticulously.

A pink slip dress clung to her curves, sheer white chiffon adding a tantalizing hint of skin.

Her dark hair cascaded down, a mix of innocence and seduction.

She walked straight to Ryan without glancing elsewhere.

"Ryan..."

Her voice dripped honey.

He looked up at the woman feigning purity before him and felt nothing but boredom.

He'd seen too many of these white lilies.

Emily was the most artificial of them all.
###Chapter 421

If not for that investment deal, he wouldn't even bother pretending to tolerate her.

This kind of woman—climbing the social ladder while putting on airs of purity—was utterly tedious.

But now that she'd dropped the act, she became even less interesting.

Ryan Cunningham suppressed his irritation and forced an excited expression. "Emily, you're here. Sit with me."

He scooted over, making space for her in the center of the sofa.

The private room erupted in teasing cheers.

"Mrs. Cunningham is here!"

"Look at Ryan—already whipped before marriage!"

"Since when does Ryan follow orders like this?"

Emily Lowell's lips curled slightly as she gracefully settled onto the couch in her stilettos.

Ryan handed her a fruit platter, and a flicker of triumph flashed in her eyes.

So what if Alexander Valdemar had woken up?

That cold-hearted man would never treat Sophia Laurent with kindness.

He was probably only staying married because of Patriarch Valdemar's pressure.

Not like Ryan, who knew how to make her shine.

Emily accepted a wine glass and, under everyone's envious gazes, speared an apple slice to feed him.

"Try it?"

Ryan leaned in dramatically. "Thanks, wifey."

"Who's your wife?" She playfully swatted his arm, her ears turning pink.

The room exploded with laughter.

"Ryan's done for!"

"Emily's got him wrapped around her finger!"

"When's the wedding?"

Emily pretended to be flustered and bolted for the door.

Ryan watched her exaggerated exit with disdain.

Still, he chased after her.

"Emily, they were just joking—"

The hallway lights were dim. Emily suddenly spun around.

Ryan collided with her before he could react.

Her chest pressed against him. His lips twisted into a sneer.

"You hurt me!" Emily whined, pounding his chest with fake tears.
###Chapter 422

Ryan Cunningham watched Emily Lowell's feigned shyness with a hint of mockery in his eyes.

He pulled her into his arms, his fingers tracing idle circles at her waist.

"Don't be angry, darling."

As the door clicked shut, Emily melted against him.

"River Banquet" had flopped at the box office, leaving Lowell Entertainment on the brink of collapse.

She had to cling to Ryan—her last lifeline.

Raised in high society, she knew exactly how to play a man's heartstrings.

Ryan, a seasoned playboy, never turned down willing prey.

He needed the core technology of Lowell Group's medical robotics.

With Valdemar Holdings now in his younger brother's hands, he had no choice but to secure this alliance.

Marriage was just another bargaining chip.

Why waste effort when he could get what he wanted with minimal cost?

In the dim room, their shadows intertwined.

Dawn crept through the curtains.

Emily opened her eyes to meet Ryan's tender gaze.

"Good morning, my fiancée."

Her cheeks flushed. "Morning..."

"I'll arrange a meeting with our families today to finalize the engagement."

Emily's pulse quickened.

Every socialite envied her for snagging the Cunningham heir.

Once the news broke...

She lowered her lashes demurely. "Whatever you think is best."

"The wedding will be on Christmas. Plenty of time to prepare your gown and venue."

Just imagining the grandeur made Emily's lips curl.

Ryan studied her dreamy expression, amusement flickering in his eyes.

His phone rang abruptly.

He answered in front of her.

"Speak."

Emily pretended to adjust her hair, ears straining.

Ryan's expression darkened with each passing second.

The furrow between his brows only accentuated his rugged charm.

Fifteen minutes later, he hung up, tension radiating off him.

Emily leaned in. "Trouble?"

Ryan massaged his temples. "Just some company issues."
###Chapter 423

He fell silent after speaking.

The outside world knew little about the internal affairs of the Cunningham Group.

People only knew that Ryan Cunningham served as CEO while his younger brother Ryan Cunningham Jr. was vice president, with the two brothers jointly managing the enterprise.

Could the Cunninghams be facing a crisis?

Emily Lowell's heart clenched.

She quickly adjusted her expression and asked casually, "Is the company encountering difficulties?"

Ryan nodded gravely. "This is a particularly thorny problem..."

Emily pressed her lips together.

Ryan seemed oblivious to her reaction as he continued, "With the medical industry booming, we launched a surgical automaton project years ago. Unfortunately, we've been unable to recruit the renowned expert Dr. Preston Quincy..."

The name made Emily's breath catch.

Wasn't that the very Dr. Quincy Sophia Laurent had hired at great expense?

His research specialty aligned perfectly with surgical automatons.

This was supposed to be Pearl Group's classified information.

But William Lowell trusted her completely, granting unrestricted access to his office.

Sometimes even letting her sit on his lap while handling official business.

That's how she'd learned the secret.

"Is finding Dr. Quincy crucial for you?" Emily probed.

Ryan's frown deepened. "Absolutely vital."

He paused, his voice lowering. "With the project stalled, I'm afraid our engagement may need postponing."

Emily panicked.

Postpone the engagement?

Pushing him now would backfire.

Imagining the glory of becoming Mrs. Cunningham, she clenched her fists. "I might be able to contact Dr. Quincy."

Ryan's eyes flashed with calculation before lighting up with feigned delight. "Really? You know Dr. Quincy, Emily?"

His gaze brimmed with admiration. "You never cease to amaze me. Meeting you was the greatest fortune of my life."

The flattery dispelled Emily's gloom.

"Just a passing acquaintance," she demurred.

"Nonsense!" Ryan exclaimed. "You're the most perfect woman I've ever met. Marrying you would be my greatest blessing."

Emily basked in the praise.

"Let me consult Dr. Quincy first," she promised.

Though disappointment flickered in Ryan's eyes, he gently pulled her into an embrace. "If you can make this happen, you'll be the Cunningham family's savior."
###Chapter 424

Emily Lowell's lips curled upward at Ryan Cunningham's flattery.

As the功臣 of the Cunningham Group, she naturally looked down on Sophia Laurent, that healing marriage wife of the Valdemar family.

At ten in the morning, Emily strode into the Lowell Group building in her stilettos.

Since Sophia's departure, the company had been in steady decline.

One合作项目 after another was canceled. Even ongoing projects faced constant issues.

William Lowell was drowning in the mess.

Regret gnawed at him.

He never should have forced Sophia into that arranged marriage.

Though it had brought initial benefits.

Patriarch Valdemar had shown some mercy.

But after Alexander Valdemar woke from his vegetative state, the Lowell Group hit rock bottom.

Valdemar Holdings publicly severed all ties with them.

The business world was full of opportunists.

They knew which way the wind was blowing.

Within months, the Lowell Group was on the brink of collapse.

Mass layoffs became inevitable.

The once-bustling offices now stood eerily quiet.

When Emily entered the CEO's office, not even a cup of tea was offered.

She forced a smile. "William!"

Slumped in his chair, William stared blankly ahead.

At the sound of her voice, he jerked upright. "Sophia? You're back?"

Emily's face froze.

"William, it's Emily."

The light in his eyes dimmed.

He managed a weak smile. "What brings you here?"

Her lips trembled. "You don't want to see me?"

"Of course I do." He sighed. "I just didn't expect..."

"Expect what?"

William hesitated.

Last night, "River Banquet" had flopped spectacularly.

The highly anticipated film was a total disaster.

As the leading lady, Emily should have been hiding in shame.
###Chapter 425 The Secret Floor

"William, I came to see you."

Emily Lowell's voice suddenly dropped, tinged with a sob. "I'm sorry..."

William Lowell immediately ruffled her hair. "Silly girl, why apologize? This has nothing to do with you..."

A mysterious smile played on his lips. Outsiders only saw Lowell Entertainment in turmoil, unaware they still held a trump card.

Dr. Preston Quincy's medical robotics project was about to launch—their chance to turn the tide.

Seeing his genuine expression, Emily's smile returned.

She curled up on the office sofa like a child, reminiscing with William about the past.

Back when Sophia Laurent helmed Lowell Entertainment, the family thrived, each member excelling in their field.

Memories softened William's features, filling the office with warmth.

"William," Emily suddenly blinked. "Show me around the company?"

"Sure," he teased. "If you ever quit acting, you can take over the family business."

"No way!"

She shook her head, clinging to his arm. "I want my brothers to spoil me forever!"

"Dream on." He tapped her nose.

"Why not?"

Their laughter echoed as they toured every department—except the top floor.

The Lowell Tower had thirty-three floors. The executive suite occupied the thirty-second.

"Just the usual departments, nothing special..."

Emily grew impatient. She'd scoured HR, design, and product development but found no trace of the medical robot.

Then she noticed the electronic door blocking access to the thirty-third floor.

"William, let's go up there." Her eyes sparkled.

His smile faltered.

"It's a mess up there," he coaxed. "You must be tired. Let's rest in my office..."

The executive suite had a private lounge where Emily often napped.

Pouting, she pressed, "If I'm family, why can Sophia go up but not me?"

Tears welled in her eyes. She knew—if Dr. Quincy's project was there, Sophia had been.

William hesitated.

Even this small request denied, yet he claimed she was like a sister?

"Emily, you misunderstand," he explained. "Dr. Quincy works up there. No disturbances allowed—even I rarely go..."

At "Dr. Quincy," Emily's eyes lit up.

"Please, William? Just a peek. I'll be quiet." She shook his arm.

Faced with her childlike pleading, William finally nodded.

"Alright. Let's go up."
###Chapter 426

William Lowell guided Emily Lowell through three security checkpoints before reaching the core area of Dr. Quincy's laboratory.

The space resembled a futuristic factory.

Neat rows of transparent glass compartments housed medical robots emitting a cold glow.

Half the robots underwent programming adjustments, their screens flashing rapid data streams.

The other half were remotely operated by white-coated technicians simulating delicate surgeries.

"Traditional surgeries often lead to infections and complications," William explained, gesturing toward the active units. "These little marvels minimize trauma."

Top corporations worldwide struggled to develop medical robotics with little success.

Only Dr. Quincy's team had achieved groundbreaking progress.

The Lowell Group kept this breakthrough strictly confidential. Emily had only discovered the files by chance in her father's study.

After three laps around the lab, Dr. Quincy remained conspicuously absent.

"Guess we're not meeting him today," Emily pouted, disappointment flickering across her face.

William watched her curiosity with amusement, his exhaustion momentarily forgotten.

"You like it here?"

"I just want to understand your work better," Emily blinked innocently. "You've been working so hard lately."

The words warmed William's heart.

Meanwhile, Dr. Quincy sat in a secluded café on the city outskirts.

Sophia Laurent lounged in a private booth, her fingers gliding across a tablet screen.

Entertainment headlines celebrated Empress crossing the 2-billion mark at the box office.

Director Lucas Sheridan's latest social media post radiated vindication:
"Who said reality show directors can't make films?"

The comments section buzzed with celebration.

Netizens remembered the mockery from Richard Lowell's fans.

Now the tables had turned completely.

The biggest winner was leading lady Scarlett Winslow.

Her striking features and formidable acting skills had captivated audiences.

From obscurity to stardom—Scarlett needed only one film.

Her follower count skyrocketed at an astonishing rate.

Her latest update contained a single line:
"Gratitude to @SophiaLaurent. I owe you everything."

The tweet sent shippers into a frenzy.

Sophia took a sip of coffee, her lips curving into a faint smile.
###Chapter 427

Leonard Arnault and Gregory Thornfield were universally acclaimed as veteran actors in the industry.

One portrayed the chancellor, the other the general in "Empress," delivering textbook-perfect performances.

They never sought publicity, maintaining such low profiles that even award wins rarely made headlines.

But with "Empress" becoming a smash hit, netizens finally realized these masters had played all those iconic roles.

Supporting actors also gained unexpected fame. Yet the biggest winner remained Adrian Valdemar.

All those rumors about "diva behavior" and "poor acting skills" collapsed overnight. Fans were heartbroken.

"Our boy suffered so much being slandered for so long!"

"I must've been blind to ever criticize him!"

Adrian seemed overwhelmed by the sudden outpouring of affection. He signed autographs and posed for photos whenever asked.

Bystanders watched in astonishment.

"This is no playboy - he's an absolute sweetheart!"

"That fraud Damian did so much damage!"

As Adrian's fanbase exploded, Damian's social media was flooded with backlash. No amount of trending topic removals or paid trolls could stem the tide.

CRASH!

The glass door of Valdemar Entertainment's PR department shattered.

"That bastard Adrian!" Damian snarled.

"Damian."

A cold voice interrupted his rage. Sebastian Valdemar stood at the doorway, frowning.

After listening to his brother's exaggerated complaints, Sebastian said dismissively, "Just entertainers. Not worth your attention."

"Clean yourself up. Grandfather's birthday banquet is tonight."

Damian's eyes lit up. Only through their grandmother's influence had they gained any standing with the patriarch.

"I'll make sure to impress."

What did that bastard from a madwoman matter, so long as he pleased the old man?

Autumn sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting dappled patterns on Sophia Laurent's coffee cup.

Scrolling through her phone, her lips curved slightly.

Falling leaves spiraled through the courtyard air.

CREAK—

The private room door opened. The visitor wore a faded traditional suit, his temples streaked with gray.

"Ms. Laurent, my apologies for keeping you waiting."
###Chapter 428

Sophia Laurent had just set down her phone when the café's glass door swung open.

She looked up, her lips curving into an unconscious smile.

"Dr. Quincy, long time no see."

The man in the doorway wore a simple white shirt. Behind black-framed glasses, his eyes gleamed with exhaustion and excitement.

This was Dr. Preston Quincy, the renowned medical robotics expert.

"The usual?" Sophia slid the menu toward him.

He nodded. "Iced Americano."

Once the server left, he leaned forward urgently. "Ms. Laurent, we've made a breakthrough."

That rainy night six years ago felt like yesterday.

Freshly rejected by investors, his team disbanded, he'd been hunched over data in a rented apartment.

Then a ponytailed girl knocked on his door, offering to fund his medical robotics project.

He'd thought it a joke.

Until seven digits appeared in his account.

"It can perform both cardiac and complex orthopedic surgeries," Preston said, voice trembling. "Success rate: 99.8%."

Sophia's eyes lit up. "Truly?"

"Without question."

In six years, their surgical robots had revolutionized medicine.

Yet Preston kept chasing perfection.

A phone ringtone sliced through their conversation.

"Excuse me." He stepped aside to answer.

His assistant's frantic voice crackled through: "Dr. Quincy, Mr. Lowell is here with Ms. Emily Lowell. They demand a lab tour."

"Which Mr. Lowell?"

"William. Emily's adoptive brother."

Preston's brow furrowed.

He'd specifically chosen today to update Sophia. This timing couldn't be coincidence.

"Make them wait," he clipped.

Returning, he found Sophia gazing out the window, pensive.

"Emergency?" she asked, turning.

He shook his head. "Your eldest brother took Emily to the lab."

Sophia's fingers tapped the tabletop. A shadow flickered in her eyes.

"Seems someone's getting restless."
###Chapter 429

A vicious glint flashed in Gu Kaiyuan's eyes as his right fist surged with violent energy.

Boom!

The moment the two forces collided, the entire Western Plains trembled.

A tempest erupted as dark clouds pressed low.

Buildings within several miles disintegrated into dust under the shockwave.

Only the Demon-Suppressing Pagoda remained unshaken.

Both combatants staggered back, leaving deep fissures in the ground.

"Is that all you've got?"

Gu Kaiyuan threw his head back with a savage laugh, arms spread wide.

"Ancestors, grant me your power!"

A blinding light erupted from his chest as if tearing his body apart.

Chen Ping's pupils contracted.

He could clearly sense Gu Kaiyuan's aura skyrocketing beyond Martial Sovereign's peak.

A radiant orb materialized before Gu Kaiyuan's chest.

It shot toward Chen Ping like lightning.

No time to dodge.

Thud!

Chen Ping was sent flying, blood spraying from his mouth.

His golden protective barrier shattered piece by piece, scales peeling away.

"Today, you die!"

Gu Kaiyuan made a grasping motion, summoning an energy hand that dragged Chen Ping forward.

Without hesitation, he aimed a devastating punch at Chen Ping's heart.

"Perish!"

This strike contained his lifetime's cultivation.

Chen Ping gritted his teeth, channeling every ounce of spiritual power to withstand the blow.

Crack!

His golden defense shattered completely, revealing tanned skin.

Gu Kaiyuan grinned triumphantly and struck again.

At the critical moment, flames ignited around Chen Ping's right hand.

The Dragon-Slaying Sword descended with annihilating force toward Gu Kaiyuan's arm.

Gu Kaiyuan retreated hastily, wariness flashing in his eyes.

"Drawing your sword now? Too late!"

He raised his hand, and the heavens darkened.

A colossal palm materialized above Chen Ping, blotting out the sky.

Chen Ping slashed multiple sword beams upward, but the giant hand continued its descent.

The overwhelming pressure drove his feet deep into the earth.

At death's door, visions of the Sacred Fist Technique from the pagoda flooded his mind.

The fragments merged into one.

An ancient voice echoed through his consciousness:

"Formless, limitless—all dharma arises from mind. I create all beings, I destroy all existence. All phenomena are but consciousness..."
###Chapter 430

Sophia Laurent bid farewell to Dr. Preston Quincy and drove alone back to Westmount Villa.

Since the media exposed her pregnancy, she and Alexander Valdemar had agreed to maintain a facade of marriage.

Though they hadn't known each other long, their daily interactions had unexpectedly grown harmonious.

This arrangement was primarily for the sake of their unborn child.

After personally settling her in, Alexander flew to Europe to handle a cross-border acquisition.

By her calculations, today marked his return.

Tonight was Patriarch Valdemar's seventieth birthday celebration.

The old man had specifically requested their joint attendance at the family banquet.

After lunch prepared by her nutritionist, Sophia retired to her room for a nap.

She awoke to a sky painted in sunset hues.

Descending the stairs, she found Alexander in the living room, engrossed in documents.

His tall frame was bathed in golden light, his chiseled profile perfection itself.

Focused on the screen, his slender fingers danced across the keyboard.

The scene was tranquil, beautiful.

Sophia instinctively softened her footsteps.

Alexander sensed her presence, lifting his gaze to meet hers.

Those typically icy eyes held a rare warmth.

"Rest well?"

His crisp voice snapped her back to reality.

"Yes."

She nodded sheepishly. "Did I oversleep?"

"Perfect timing."

He closed his laptop, standing to reveal impeccably tailored trousers accentuating his long legs.

"Let's go."

Sophia changed into a beige knit dress, its loose cut discreetly concealing her slight baby bump.

They moved toward separate cars before realizing their mistake.

Pausing awkwardly, Sophia tentatively suggested, "Should we... go separately?"

Alexander stilled.

Slowly closing his car door, he approached her.

The setting sun gilded his silhouette.

"Sophia."

His deep voice brooked no argument. "We're legally married."

Her heart skipped a beat.

Even knowing this was merely transactional, his words sent a thrill through her.

"Would my wife do me the honor," he murmured, bowing slightly with outstretched hand, "of allowing me to fulfill my husbandly duties?"

As if enchanted, she placed her hand in his.

"The honor is mine."
###Chapter 431

The opposing lawyer handed a document to the judge.

"This is the paternity test report between Mr. Qiao Xusheng and Ms. Qiao Ruoxing. The results confirm no biological father-daughter relationship exists."

"Ms. Qiao was born from Ms. He Yurou's extramarital affair. Our client bears no legal obligation for her upbringing. She also forfeits inheritance rights."

Qiao Ruoxing shot up from her seat. The chair screeched against the floor.

"That's bullshit! Qiao Xusheng, how dare you lie like this to win the case? You know exactly how Mom treated you!"

Her entire body trembled with rage.

The judge banged the gavel. "Plaintiff, maintain decorum in my courtroom."

Mo Mingxuan grasped Qiao Ruoxing's wrist. "Wait. Let them verify the results first."

The jury examined the document.

Qiao Ruoxing clenched her fists. "This has to be fake! My mother would never cheat!"

Mo Mingxuan's expression darkened.

Court-approved paternity tests rarely got falsified. Qiao Xusheng wouldn't present it unless genuine.

The jury soon confirmed the report's authenticity.

Qiao Ruoxing froze as if struck by lightning.

How could she not be Qiao Xusheng's daughter?

The gallery erupted in whispers.

Camera shutters clicked wildly. This wealthy family drama just got juicier.

Tang Xiaoxiao stomped her foot, shooting anxious glances at Mo Mingxuan.

Even Mo Mingxuan hadn't anticipated this twist.

"Your Honor," Qiao Xusheng suddenly spoke. "I'd like to address my daughter."

After receiving permission, he turned to Qiao Ruoxing with pained eyes.

"Ruoxing, I never wanted things to come to this. I planned to take this secret to my grave."

His voice cracked with emotion.

"For years, I treated you as my own. Even after your mother passed, I hoped to preserve our bond."

"If you needed money after divorcing Gu Jingyan, you could've asked me directly. Why drag us to court?"

His twisted words churned Qiao Ruoxing's stomach.
###Chapter 432

Sophia Laurent stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, her fingers absently tracing the rim of her wine glass.

The crimson liquid swirled as her thoughts drifted.

Alexander Valdemar was, after all, a man like any other.

What man wouldn't want a real family?

Their contractual marriage had only ever been a temporary solution.

Her knuckles whitened at the memory of Patriarch Valdemar's decision to publicly acknowledge her status.

She'd acted too hastily to save Pearl Entertainment.

Now, she wondered if there had been another way.

"It doesn't trouble me."

Alexander's voice came from behind her, sudden and calm.

Sophia turned to meet his dark, fathomless gaze.

"Nor do I wish to marry anyone else."

His tone was even, each word deliberate.

Sophia blinked, momentarily stunned.

The wine reflected the subtle flutter of her lashes.

She didn't press further.

Promises could be broken.

But for now, his words were like a breeze, clearing the fog in her heart.

Night fell over Valdemar Manor, its grand halls ablaze with light.

It was the first time in three years the Patriarch had hosted such an elaborate birthday celebration.

Beneath the crystal chandeliers, guests mingled in glittering attire.

All eyes turned to Alexander the moment he entered.

"Congratulations, Mr. Valdemar!"

"Your wife is as talented as she is beautiful!"

The compliments came thick and fast.

Sophia stood at Alexander's side, her smile perfectly poised.

Pearl Entertainment was hardly a titan of industry.

At events like these, she'd always been relegated to the periphery.

Tonight, she was the center of attention.

"Stop crowding my granddaughter-in-law."

Patriarch Valdemar approached with his cane, his tone teasing but firm.

Several business magnates chuckled.

"Old Valdemar, you're too protective!"

"We've barely had a chance to speak with her!"

The Patriarch lifted his chin, smug.

"Then bring your own grandchildren's spouses next time."

The room fell silent.

With a satisfied smile, he guided Sophia to a seating area.

"Sophia, you should rest."

She shook her head, amused.

"Grandfather, I'm perfectly fine."
###Chapter 433

The Patriarch Valdemar had just raised his wine glass when the crystal chandeliers in the banquet hall dimmed abruptly.

A spotlight illuminated the center of the stage.

"Thank you all for honoring this old man with your presence at my birthday celebration."

His voice boomed across the room as his gaze swept over the assembled guests.

A brief pause. Then, a benevolent smile graced his weathered face.

"Today, I wish to formally introduce my granddaughter-in-law—Sophia Laurent."

The grand doors of the banquet hall burst open before the echoes of his words could fade.

"You senile old fool!"

A shrill female voice sliced through the air like a blade.

Every head turned toward the entrance.

Matriarch Valdemar strode in, her sandalwood cane striking the marble floor with each deliberate step. Behind her trailed Vincent Valdemar and his family of three.

All eyes locked onto the young woman beside Sebastian Valdemar.

Natalie Lockwood shimmered in a moon-white qipao, a string of pearls glowing against her slender neck. She dipped her chin slightly, revealing the elegant curve of her swan-like neck.

A deathly silence blanketed the hall.

The Patriarch's expression darkened instantly.

Once inseparable through hardship, the elderly couple had grown estranged over their conflicting philosophies on raising children. When Vincent's infidelity came to light years ago, the Patriarch had banished him from the family estate.

The Matriarch, however, believed her son had merely committed "a mistake any man might make."

"Who permitted your entry?"

The Patriarch's voice could have frozen hell itself.

The Matriarch's head snapped up. Her cane struck the ground with a thunderous crack.

"How dare you?"

"The divorce papers are already signed."

His declaration detonated like a bomb.

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

Damian Valdemar leaped forward. "Grandfather! Grandmother came to celebrate your birthday!"

The Patriarch didn't even glance his way.

"Security. Escort them out."

His eyes softened as they found Sophia.

"Come here, my dear."
###Chapter 434

Patriarch Valdemar's decision sent shockwaves through the banquet hall.

Matriarch Valdemar turned deathly pale, stumbling back two steps.

"Alexander Valdemar, have you lost your mind?"

Her shrill voice shattered the silence of the grand ballroom.

Vincent Valdemar rushed forward to steady her. "Mother, please calm down."

He turned to the patriarch with pleading eyes. "Father, Mother spent three months preparing your birthday gift by hand."

Guests exchanged uneasy glances, whispers rippling through the crowd.

The patriarch frowned at his wife's unsteady stance.

Vincent's gaze shifted to Alexander, accusation heavy in his tone. "Would you really discard family ties for an outsider?"

All eyes snapped to Sophia Laurent.

Sebastian Valdemar lingered at the back of the crowd, his expression torn between admiration and resentment.

This woman had single-handedly dismantled his carefully laid plans.

Sophia's lips curved into a faint smile as she prepared to speak.

Alexander stepped protectively in front of her, his voice icy. "What family ties? I've never met this grandmother you speak of."

The revelation made guests turn questioning looks toward Vincent.

Vincent's face darkened.

For years, the matriarch had schemed to match Alexander with Natalie Lockwood, only to be repeatedly rejected.

Yet now he readily accepted an arranged marriage proposed by the patriarch.

How could the proud matriarch swallow such humiliation?

"Marriage should be decided by elders," Vincent declared righteously. "How could you exclude your own grandmother?"

Murmurs of agreement spread through the room.

Alexander's eyes turned glacial. "So you're suggesting I abandon my pregnant wife?"

The statement landed like a boulder in still waters.

The guests finally understood.

Sophia wasn't just accomplished—she carried the Valdemar heir.

Even the patriarch had approved this union.

What exactly was the matriarch objecting to?
###Chapter 435

The crowd suddenly understood, casting subtle glances at Matriarch Valdemar.

"Sophia Laurent is such an exceptional young woman. Talented and elegant—she's the perfect match for Alexander."

"If I had a granddaughter-in-law like her, I'd cherish her every day. How could anyone bear to mistreat her?"

"Has the Matriarch lost her senses?"

The hushed whispers reached Matriarch Valdemar's ears.

Her face paled, then flushed with anger. Yet she remained stubbornly rooted in place.

"We'll discuss this another time," she said stiffly, straightening her posture. Her resentful gaze turned to Patriarch Valdemar. "I came specifically to celebrate your birthday. Is this how you welcome me?"

Patriarch Valdemar sighed wearily.

"You're always welcome as a guest."

He motioned for the security to step back, his voice firm. "But let me make one thing clear—Sophia will always be part of our family."

At his signal, attendants approached with gilded trays.

Each tray held stacks of documents alongside dazzling jewelry.

An imperial jade bracelet glowed softly under the lights. A tiara embedded with pigeon-blood rubies shimmered brilliantly. And there, resting on velvet, was the legendary blue diamond necklace that had shattered auction records.

"Sophia," Patriarch Valdemar said warmly, "these are my gifts to you."

The documents revealed deeds to luxury estates worldwide, certificates for limited-edition sports cars, and authentication papers for the priceless jewels.

The total value exceeded three billion.

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Sebastian Valdemar remained expressionless, his gaze cool.

But Vincent Valdemar and Damian Valdemar stared at the documents with bloodshot eyes.

Three billion!

Damian clenched his fists until his nails drew blood.

He was the true Valdemar heir. How could these treasures go to an outsider?

This was all Alexander's fault!

His venomous glare flickered toward Alexander before he quickly lowered his head.

In a shadowed corner, Natalie Lockwood trembled violently.

Those jewels should have been hers!

Matriarch Valdemar had groomed her since childhood—sent her abroad for elite education, promised her the Valdemar legacy.

Now everything lay in ruins.

She bit her lip until the metallic taste of blood filled her mouth.

Even Matriarch Valdemar looked stunned.

She had no prior knowledge of this display. "This is your birthday banquet!" she snapped. "Such matters can wait!"
###Chapter 436

Matriarch Valdemar stared at the priceless jewelry and property deeds, her heart aching as if slashed by a knife.

These assets should have belonged to the Valdemar family. Now they were being handed over to an outsider.

Her fingers tightened around her handkerchief, knuckles turning white.

"Patriarch, shouldn't we reconsider this?" She suppressed her fury, her voice trembling.

Patriarch Valdemar didn't even lift his eyelids.

"Reconsider what? My decision is final."

The Matriarch's chest heaved violently. She could no longer contain herself.

"I refuse!" She slammed the table and stood abruptly. "Sophia Laurent will never set foot in this house as long as I live!"

The banquet hall fell deathly silent.

Guests held their breaths, eyes darting between the Valdemar family members.

Patriarch Valdemar's expression darkened.

"Security."

Two black-suited bodyguards stepped forward immediately.

"Escort the Matriarch to her quarters."

Her eyes widened in disbelief.

Natalie Lockwood hurried to assist but was blocked by the guards.

Vincent Valdemar opened his mouth to speak but was promptly ushered out.

Sebastian Valdemar wisely pulled his younger brother away.

Once the commotion settled, Patriarch Valdemar massaged his temples wearily.

"My apologies for the spectacle."

Guests quickly smoothed things over.

"The Matriarch is elderly. It's understandable she'd be upset."

"Time will ease her concerns."

The Patriarch gave no response. Turning to Sophia, his face softened into a grandfatherly smile.

"Sign the papers, my dear."

Sophia hesitated, glancing at Alexander.

The man looked exceptionally tall in his cream-colored suit. He took the documents and flipped them open for her.

"Accept Grandfather's gift."

Sophia clutched the pen uncertainly.

Alexander leaned in, his whisper brushing her ear. "Sign and become Mrs. Valdemar. Or don't..."

The pen finally touched paper.

Patriarch Valdemar nodded in satisfaction, as if the earlier scene had never occurred.
###Chapter 437

Patriarch Valdemar's usually stern face was now radiant with smiles, the wrinkles at his eyes smoothing out. "Good, very good. Sophia, if this brat ever dares to mistreat you, come straight to me. I'll teach him a proper lesson."

His open favoritism toward Sophia Laurent was on full display before all the guests.

This was his genuine attitude.

Sophia met the old man's affectionate gaze with a slight curve of her lips. "Don't worry, Grandfather. He treats me very well."

"Haha, that's good to hear."

Patriarch Valdemar instructed his staff to carefully store the congratulatory gifts, arranging a special vehicle to deliver them to Westmount Villa.

After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Sophia, he excused himself to rest due to fatigue.

Many older guests took the cue to depart, leaving the banquet hall to business associates discussing deals and younger attendees brought by their elders for networking.

Once the patriarch left, Alexander Valdemar was pulled away by several business partners.

Soon, Sophia found herself surrounded by unfamiliar faces. She exchanged polite greetings before gracefully extricating herself.

The autumn night carried a slight chill. Tree shadows swayed in the garden, accompanied by the occasional chirp of cicadas.

A cool breeze brushed through her hair as Sophia settled onto a bench.

Unseen bodyguards maintained vigilant watch nearby.

Just as she was enjoying this moment of tranquility, a shrill voice shattered the peace.

"Look how triumphant you are tonight, sister!"

Sophia looked up, surprised to see Emily Lowell whom she hadn't encountered in months.

Her eyebrow arched slightly. "How did you get in?"

Given Sophia's estrangement from the Lowell family, no invitation had been extended to them.

The question instantly struck a nerve.

Emily had always sailed through life smoothly. Even after the truth of her parentage emerged, Sophia remained beneath her—merely a pawn of the Lowell family.

But since marrying into the Valdemars, Sophia had climbed to heights Emily could only envy.

This position should have been hers.

If not for her "generosity," how could Sophia enjoy such glory?

Flames of jealousy burned in Emily's eyes. "What are you so proud of? If I hadn't given you this arranged marriage opportunity, where would you be today?"

Sophia regarded Emily's contorted expression with an amused chuckle.

"Emily Lowell, have you forgotten something fundamental?"

"What?"

"That you were born to butchers? That your biological parents were despicable thieves?"

Sophia's tone remained calm as she leaned back casually on the bench, a faint smile playing on her lips. "As for you 'giving' me the marriage opportunity—that's the real joke."

Not only did the marriage never rightfully belong to Emily, but she had explicitly rejected it when Alexander was comatose, forcing Sophia to take her place.

Watching Emily's face twist further, Sophia raised an eyebrow. "What's wrong? Having regrets now that Alexander has woken up?"

Emily trembled violently. Her gaze fell on Sophia's slightly rounded abdomen, venom flashing in her eyes.

Just some cheap woman riding on her pregnancy!

Without this child, what worth did she have?

With a sudden lunge, Emily hurled herself at Sophia.

Anticipating the move, Sophia sidestepped neatly.

"Thud—"

Emily crashed heavily into the bench.

A piercing scream tore through the garden. "Ah—!"
###Chapter 438

Sophia Laurent heard rapid footsteps approaching from behind and immediately stood up in alert.

She took two steps back to create distance as her bodyguard swiftly moved to shield her.

Emily Lowell's outstretched hand grasped empty air as she collided heavily with the backrest of the bench.

"Ah!"

Her knees hit the hard ground with a painful thud.

"Sophia! How despicable!" Emily glared up with fury.

Sophia arched an eyebrow. "You tried to push me, then blame me when you fell?"

The shrill scream drew curious glances from nearby guests.

Emily's eyes flickered before instantly transforming into a pitiful expression.

Her choice of pink chiffon dress now accentuated her fragile vulnerability.

"Sister, I know you're jealous of me..."

Her voice trembled with feigned emotion. "I just came to wish Patriarch Valdemar happy birthday. Why would you treat me like this?"

The onlookers' gazes toward Sophia turned judgmental.

"Nonsense!" The bodyguard snapped. "You attacked first!"

Emily flinched and turned away, deliberately displaying the scrapes on her knees.

"Emily!"

Ryan Cunningham rushed over and helped her up with visible concern.

"Is this how the Valdemar heiress treats her sister?" He glared at Sophia.

Sophia gave a light laugh.

"First, we share no blood relation."

"Second, my bodyguard stated the facts."

Ryan refused to listen.

He had to defend Emily—she'd promised to obtain Dr. Quincy's research data.

"Alexander!" Ryan turned abruptly. "Is this Valdemar hospitality?"

All eyes shifted toward Alexander Valdemar.

Such an accusation could indeed damage the Valdemar reputation.

Emily hid in Ryan's embrace, flashing Sophia a triumphant look.

She'd nearly choked on envy upon seeing that three-billion welcome gift.

All this should have been hers!

If only she hadn't let Sophia take her arranged marriage spot...
###Chapter 439

This failed attempt didn't matter.

If she could use this opportunity to drive a wedge between Alexander and Sophia, forcing her out of the Valdemar family, it would be a godsend.

Alexander remained composed under the crowd's skeptical gazes. "Ryan Cunningham," he said calmly, "jumping to conclusions without thorough investigation is reckless."

Adrian stood behind him, his voice icy. "Exactly. Making judgments based on one-sided accusations isn't wise."

He stared at Emily's deliberately fragile expression, disgust churning in his stomach. This woman was clearly scheming—how dare she frame his sister-in-law?

With both sides sticking to their stories, the truth was hard to discern.

The Valdemar Manor sprawled across vast grounds, shaded by lush trees. This remote corner lay beyond the surveillance cameras' reach.

Emily had counted on that when she brazenly set up her trap.

The standoff continued.

Emily tugged at Ryan's sleeve, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. "Ryan, let it go... Sophia couldn't have meant it. I don't blame her."

Her act of false magnanimity only reinforced the "fact" that Sophia had pushed her.

Ryan gripped her hand protectively. "Emily, you're the future matriarch of the Cunningham family. I won't let you suffer any injustice."

He turned to Alexander, his tone frigid. "Mr. Valdemar, my fiancée was injured in your home. A simple apology from your wife will settle this without affecting our business relations."

On the surface, it sounded reasonable—just a verbal apology.

The guests murmured in agreement:

"Miss Lowell did get hurt. An apology isn't too much to ask."

"Her injuries should be treated first."

"Sibling squabbles happen..."

Their whispers implied that Sophia would be petty not to apologize.

Alexander's expression darkened.

Adrian exploded. "You call this a birthday celebration? This was a setup against my sister-in-law!"

He smirked coldly. "Oh, I remember now—Miss Lowell here has quite the grudge against Sophia..."
###Chapter 440

Most guests were unaware of the past conflicts between Sophia Laurent and Emily Lowell.

But Adrian Valdemar was different.

To get closer to Sophia, he had thoroughly investigated her feud with the Lowell family.

"You enjoyed all the privileges as the Lowell heiress, yet caused trouble everywhere after the real daughter returned. Now you're bringing these tricks to the Valdemar family?"

Adrian sneered. "Too bad we're not blind like the Lowells..."

Emily's face paled.

She finally recognized him as the actor who played the Young Marquis in "Empress."

"Mr. Valdemar, must you humiliate me just to defend your sister-in-law?"

The guests were surprised by the Valdemars' fierce protection of Sophia.

It was just an apology. Why such a strong reaction?

Several guests with business ties to the Cunninghams spoke up.

"As hostess, shouldn't Mrs. Valdemar apologize when a guest falls?"

But Valdemar allies immediately countered.

"Didn't you hear Emily was the one who crashed into her? Does being Ryan Cunningham's fiancée give her license to twist the truth?"

All eyes turned to Alexander Valdemar.

Sophia rested her chin on one hand, smiling at him with amusement.

Alexander met her gaze.

His heart softened. He gently stroked her hair.

"I won't let you be wronged."

Under the warm golden lights, the strikingly handsome man gazed tenderly at his delicate wife—a breathtaking scene.

The crowd was stunned by the rare gentleness from this usually aloof man.

When Alexander looked up, his eyes turned icy.

"Call the police," he ordered coldly. "Ryan Cunningham's fiancée attempted to murder my wife and unborn child."

Gasps filled the room as guests stepped back.

Adrian's eyes lit up.

"Attempted murder with solid evidence. Brilliant move!"

Ryan's face darkened.

"Alexander, are you declaring war on the Cunninghams? The Valdemars are being too arrogant in front of all these people!"

He tried to turn other families against the Valdemars.

Alexander surveyed the crowd, his voice steady and commanding.

"Anyone who harms my wife and child will face the full consequences."

The guests who had been swayed by Ryan now understood.

Protecting one's family was only natural. What was wrong with that?
###Chapter 441

The Cunninghams have finally shown their true colors.

After playing second fiddle for so long, their ambition has grown unchecked. How dare they bare their fangs at the Valdemars?

Today's farce was clearly orchestrated by the Cunninghams.

They sought to tarnish the Valdemar name in high society.

But Alexander Valdemar isn't one to be trifled with.

"Ryan Cunningham, I won't forget this insult to my family," Alexander said, his voice icy.

Ryan smirked. "Alexander, I'll repay today's humiliation tenfold."

"Be my guest." Alexander's tone was dismissive.

Emily Lowell stood nearby, her eyes glinting with malice.

She hadn't expected Alexander to defend Sophia so fiercely.

Not even a simple apology could be negotiated.

No matter.

As long as Sophia's reputation took a hit, her goal was achieved.

Bodyguards blocked their path with stone-faced efficiency.

"No one leaves until the police arrive."

Ryan whirled around, livid. "Alexander! You've crossed a line!"

Alexander adjusted his cufflinks leisurely. "Weren't you the ones demanding justice?"

Adrian Valdemar wrinkled his nose as he sidled up to Sophia.

"Let's step back, sis. These two reek of desperation."

The crowd instinctively gave them wider berth.

Ryan trembled with rage. "Show some respect now, and I might spare you later!"

Adrian made a show of cleaning his ear. "With what? The Cunningham fortune couldn't buy a Valdemar fingernail."

"You—"

Ryan's fists clenched.

Dr. Preston Quincy's research would be completed soon.

With that technology, the Cunninghams would rise to power.

"Mark my words! Valdemar's reign is ending!"

Alexander didn't even blink. "We'll see."

Sirens wailed in the distance.

As Emily was led away, her mind raced with contingency plans.

The Valdemars' retaliation only proved Sophia's importance.

Guests exchanged knowing glances.

Who would dare underestimate the Valdemar heiress now?

Sophia watched their retreating figures, a thoughtful smile playing on her lips.

She remembered the shadowy figure outside Dr. Quincy's office.

The banquet lasted well into the night.

Behind the Valdemar Manor's artificial rocks, two figures whispered.

"Did you hear? The Patriarch gifted his granddaughter-in-law a dowry worth over three billion!"

"Tsk tsk. Mrs. Valdemar has truly ascended to the highest branch..."
###Chapter 442

"Oh my god, how wonderful it would be to marry the Valdemar heir!"

"Absolutely! I heard Patriarch Valdemar's welcome gift for his grandson's bride is worth three billion!"

Behind the rockery, Jasmine Keane clenched the hem of her dress.

She'd deliberately worn her most expensive white dress today. Though the fabric was slightly coarse, the design was refreshingly elegant.

Beside her, Julian Valdemar fidgeted with the gift box in his arms, his shirt cuffs slightly yellowed.

"Maybe... we should just go back," Julian murmured.

Jasmine whirled around, impatience flashing in her eyes.

Ever since being cast out from the Valdemar family, Julian had become timid. His monthly salary of ten thousand couldn't even afford the handbag she wanted.

"Don't you want to see your grandfather?" she softened her tone, "And Alexander... he just woke up..."

Julian's gaze wavered.

He did miss his family. But in his current state, he could only afford the cheapest gifts...

Recognizing his hesitation, Jasmine sighed dramatically. "Fine. It's not like Patriarch Valdemar needs your blessings anyway."

The words pierced Julian's heart like needles.

Taking a deep breath, he strode toward the mansion's entrance.

A triumphant smile curled Jasmine's lips.

As the doorbell rang, she smoothed her dress, her eyes gleaming with calculation.

Three billion... enough to last her a lifetime.
###Chapter 443

What a complete fool!

That worthless Julian Valdemar actually left the Valdemar estate without a fight after Sophia Laurent kicked him out?

Didn't he know he could go complain to Patriarch Valdemar?

Even if he didn't dare make a scene, couldn't he at least pretend to be pitiful?

Such a spineless coward!

The Valdemar estate gates slowly creaked open, revealing a middle-aged maid.

"Young Master Julian, what brings you here?"

Her expression suddenly darkened as she remembered something.

"Tonight is the Patriarch's birthday banquet. Do you have an invitation?"

Jasmine Keane's eyes widened in disbelief.

How dare a servant speak to them like this?

What shocked her more was Julian's reaction. Instead of anger, his face showed only apology.

"Aunt Sunny, my apologies for disturbing you. I don't have an invitation, but could you please inform Grandfather that I've come to wish him a happy birthday?"

The maid nodded curtly.

"Wait here."

The gates closed again.

Jasmine gritted her teeth in fury.

Once she married into the Valdemar family, this old hag would be the first one she'd fire!

How dare a servant block her master from entering his own home!

But now wasn't the time to make a scene.

She sighed softly, adopting a fragile tone.

"Julian, it's all my fault for dragging you into this..."

Julian gently squeezed her hand.

"Don't say that. I'm actually happy with how things are."

Supporting the woman he loved through his own efforts filled him with satisfaction.

"I'll work hard to save enough money for our wedding."

Jasmine nearly rolled her eyes.

Wasn't inheriting the Valdemar fortune better?

Why not ask the Patriarch for support? Who did Sophia think she was?

"I don't care about a dowry..."

"That's not acceptable." Julian said firmly. "A dowry shows a man's sincerity."

"At my current salary, I'll have saved two hundred thousand in three years."

Jasmine almost laughed in his face.

Two hundred thousand? That wouldn't even buy one of her handbags!

"You're so thoughtful, Julian."

"Of course. You're my future wife."

As they spoke, the gates reopened.

"The Patriarch will see you now."

Julian exhaled in relief.

"Thank you, Aunt Sunny."

He took Jasmine's hand and hurried inside.

Jasmine greedily surveyed the magnificent estate.

This grand mansion should have been her home.

What expensive gift would the Patriarch give her?
###Chapter 444

Jasmine Keane followed Julian Valdemar in her high heels. Her heart pounded violently as they entered the banquet hall of the Valdemar mansion.

The crystal chandelier's glare made her squint.

Julian's palms grew damp with sweat.

He hadn't stepped foot in the Valdemar estate since that phone call months ago.

The birthday gift he brought was a lacquerware piece purchased with three months' salary.

"Grandfather, I wish you boundless happiness and eternal health."

The Patriarch's fingers hesitated briefly when accepting the gift.

Their last unpleasant encounter still lingered. Yet seeing his grandson's gaunt face, the old man's eyes softened.

"You've come a long way. That's enough."

Julian's tense shoulders visibly relaxed. "I'm glad you're not angry."

"Everyone has their own path." The Patriarch sipped his tea calmly.

Jasmine twisted her fingers anxiously.

"Grandfather Valdemar," she interjected with honeyed sweetness, "May your brilliance rival the sun and moon, your vitality never fade."

The Patriarch finally looked at her.

"And you are?"

Julian immediately clasped Jasmine's hand. "My girlfriend, Jasmine Keane."

The old man studied their joined hands for several seconds before sighing deeply.

"As long as you're certain."

Julian's eyes brightened. "Thank you, Grandfather!"

Jasmine nearly laughed aloud.

She eagerly echoed, "Thank you, Grandfather!"

The Patriarch abruptly set down his teacup.

"It's getting late. You should leave now."

Jasmine's smile froze.

She stared in disbelief as the old man rose with his cane.

Where was the lavish welcome she expected?

Where were the customary gifts?

That bitch Sophia Laurent got three billion, yet she didn't even receive a jewelry box!

Even in the taxi, Jasmine kept looking back.

The Valdemar mansion's lights grew distant as her nails dug into her palms.
###Chapter 445

Tiffany Sinclair lowered her lashes, the long fringe casting delicate shadows beneath her eyes.

She bit her lower lip lightly, suppressing the turbulent emotions swirling in her gaze.

Adrian Valdemar watched coldly as Julian Valdemar laughed with unrestrained delight across the room. An inexplicable fury ignited in his chest.

"What an idiot..."

Beside him, the doll-faced girl wore a haute couture gown in smoky gray, her hair elegantly pinned up to lend an air of maturity.

Those almond-shaped eyes concealed undercurrents of emotion—this was Tiffany Sinclair, Julian's fiancée.

Realizing his companion, Adrian quickly backtracked. "Don't take it to heart, Tiffany. Julian's just blinded by stupidity."

Tiffany suddenly laughed, revealing her signature little canine teeth. "I'm not upset."

She was merely calculating how to handle her parents' inevitable interrogation later. The Sinclair family had mapped out her life with precision—becoming the perfect Valdemar daughter-in-law.

Watching Alexander Valdemar's tender care for Sophia Laurent, a pang of bitterness rose in her chest.

Both were arranged marriages, yet she was publicly scorned by Julian while bearing the full weight of family expectations.

If Julian insisted on breaking the engagement...

The thought sent a chill through her fingertips. Since she was fourteen, everyone had told her she would marry into the Valdemar family.

Now, calling it off would make her the laughingstock of their entire social circle.

That was why she'd barely left home these past two years. Only Patriarch Valdemar's birthday banquet had forced her family to drag her here.

Fortunately, the old man had already retired, and her parents were busy socializing elsewhere. No one noticed the tension brewing in this corner.

Tiffany silently prayed the couple would leave quickly, but Julian began striding toward them. She immediately lowered her head, wishing she could vanish into the chair.

"Adrian, long time no see," Julian greeted with a smile.

Adrian rolled his eyes dramatically. "What's the point of seeing someone who's blind?" He gave a sarcastic thumbs-up. "Bravo, abandoning your family for a woman. Such backbone!"

Julian shook his head ruefully. "You'll understand when you find true love."

"Gag—" Adrian fake-retched. "Take your white lotus and get lost!"
###Chapter 446

Adrian's dismissive attitude made Julian decide not to press further.

He turned to bid farewell to Alexander and Sophia.

Jasmine suddenly grabbed his sleeve.

Her eyes reddened with unshed tears. "Young Master Adrian, have I done something wrong?"

Adrian scoffed. "Drop the act. Your tricks don't work on me."

Jasmine dabbed her eyes, voice trembling. "Miss Sinclair, I apologize. I didn't know about your history with Julian..."

Her tone shifted subtly. "But they're brothers after all..."

The implication was clear—Tiffany was stirring trouble between them.

Julian frowned.

He grasped Jasmine's hand firmly. "Adrian, Jasmine will be your sister-in-law soon."

His gaze flickered toward Tiffany.

That single glance ignited Adrian's fury.

"Eyes to yourself!" He slammed his glass down. "You think this fake deserves your attention?"

"Adrian!" Julian's rare anger surfaced. "One more word and we're done."

Adrian froze.

Then exploded. "You'd cut ties with me for her?"

"Not cutting ties." Julian's voice softened. "But if you can't get along, limited contact benefits everyone."

"Have you lost your mind?"

Adrian raised his fist, ready to strike.

Tiffany quickly intercepted him. "Don't be rash..."

Though volatile, Adrian stilled at her touch.

"She's clearly manipulating you and Julian!"

Tiffany shook her head. "It doesn't matter. I barely know them anyway."

She planned to offer token mediation.

Just enough to save face later.

To her surprise, Adrian actually heeded her.

"Tiff..." Adrian suddenly noticed her small canine teeth, his anger dissipating.

He grinned. "Julian's always been an idiot. Never good enough for you."

Tiffany coughed lightly. "That's not what I meant."

She addressed the couple. "Since Mr. Valdemar has found love, let's cancel the arranged marriage. I wish you both happiness."
###Chapter 447

Tiffany Sinclair's lips curved into a perfectly polite smile, her gaze as calm as still water.

Her slender fingers rested lightly on the champagne flute, exuding effortless grace.

Julian Valdemar found himself inexplicably unsettled by those clear almond-shaped eyes.

Their startling purity stirred a long-buried memory within him.

"Thank you for your understanding, Miss Sinclair." He quickly composed himself with a courteous nod.

Tiffany inclined her head slightly, her smile not reaching those fathomless eyes.

Beside them, Adrian Valdemar stood with a thunderous expression.

"Get lost if you're done." His voice dripped with undisguised hostility. "I'm not here to entertain your theatrics."

Julian merely shook his head in resignation, accustomed to his younger brother's temper.

"I should bid farewell to Alexander."

Taking Jasmine Keane's hand, he turned to leave. The girl's eyes glistened with unshed tears, her nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

Jasmine seethed with humiliation.

Adrian's public slight stung, but Julian's silence hurt more.

What infuriated her most was Julian's noticeably different demeanor toward that Sinclair heiress.

Across the ballroom, Alexander Valdemar had just concluded his conversation with several business magnates.

Sophia Laurent sat alone in the lounge area, scrolling through her phone.

"Sister-in-law."

She looked up to see Julian approaching with a teary-eyed Jasmine.

"Julian." Sophia pocketed her phone, her gaze flickering between the pair.

"Adrian's throwing another tantrum," Julian offered with a wry smile.

Sophia understood immediately.

Adrian's inexplicable animosity toward Jasmine had become legendary.

"You know how he is. Don't take it personally."

"Of course." Julian's tone remained gentle.

Their fraternal bond, forged through shared childhood, was impervious to outsiders.

Sophia studied Julian thoughtfully.

The Valdemar brothers were studies in contrast.

Alexander was a drawn sword—razor-sharp yet disciplined.

Julian resembled polished jade—unassuming yet invaluable.

Adrian burned like wildfire—all passion and no restraint.

"This must be Miss Keane?" Sophia broke the silence.

Julian blinked as if remembering his companion. "Yes, Jasmine. Last time—"

He trailed off awkwardly.

The memory of being tricked by Adrian into asking Sophia for money still made him cringe.
###Chapter 448

Julian Valdemar couldn't help but chuckle.

He had gained nothing from Sophia Laurent. Instead, he'd temporarily lost his inheritance rights to the Valdemar family.

Yet strangely, he found this outcome oddly satisfying.

Countless times before, Patriarch Valdemar had stubbornly insisted on the arranged marriage with the Sinclair family, refusing to budge.

The two families had deep collaborations across multiple industries, their interests intricately intertwined.

The marriage alliance served as a crucial bond maintaining this relationship. Its dissolution would bring unimaginable consequences.

The thought had given Julian endless headaches.

Now the old man had finally relented—undoubtedly out of respect for Sophia.

"Miss Keane, hello." Sophia nodded politely at Jasmine.

Jasmine's fingers tightened slightly at her sides, a shadow flickering through her eyes.

But in an instant, she conjured a sweet smile. "Hello, sister-in-law."

She used the term Julian had chosen.

Sophia didn't correct her.

She and Julian had agreed to a one-year trial.

If they lasted a year without breaking up, she would help him dissolve his engagement with Tiffany Sinclair.

But... would they really make it that far?

Sophia's lips curved slightly.

She hadn't missed the hatred in Jasmine's eyes or the whitened knuckles from clenched fists.

Alexander Valdemar chose that moment to enter.

"Brother!" Julian greeted him warmly. "Are you feeling better?"

Alexander gave a terse nod.

Julian, accustomed to his brother's aloofness, continued cheerfully, "Let me introduce you. This is Jasmine Keane."

He paused, voice firm. "The woman I want to spend my life with."

Alexander acknowledged with another nod.

He'd heard all about his brother's broken engagement and new romance from Henry Chamberlain during his hospital stay.

"It's getting late. You should head back."

Julian nodded. "Take care, sister-in-law."

As he led Jasmine away, he failed to notice the fury simmering in her eyes.

Jasmine was seething.

Julian hadn't mentioned a word about being kicked out of the Valdemar estate!

If Alexander learned Sophia had banished them while he was comatose, even if he didn't reprimand her, resentment would surely take root.

Between blood relatives and an outsider, Alexander's allegiance was obvious.

This could be their ticket back into the Valdemar fold—perhaps even reclaiming Julian's inheritance.

Without it, their current two-million monthly allowance would let them live lavishly.

Far better than scraping by like this!

Jasmine longed to crack open Julian's skull to see what nonsense filled it...

Sophia watched their retreating figures, her smile laced with quiet amusement.
###Chapter 449

"Alexander, he's your own cousin. You don't blame me for this, do you?"

Sophia Laurent tapped her fingers lightly on the table, watching the retreating figure through the window.

Alexander Valdemar didn't even lift his gaze. "He brought this upon himself."

"I heard he can't even afford rent now."

Sophia turned her attention back to Alexander's sharp profile.

The second son of the Valdemar family now wore faded shirts with frayed cuffs.

Alexander took a sip of tea. "He chose this path."

On the garden path, Jasmine Keane's heels crushed fallen leaves.

"Julian! Have you forgotten why we came here today?"

She spun around, chest heaving.

Julian Valdemar blinked before offering a gentle smile. "Don't be upset, Jasmine."

"Adrian has always been like this—even Patriarch Valdemar couldn't control him."

Jasmine rolled her eyes internally.

She forced a tight smile. "I don't mind. But why didn't you explain things properly?"

The wind caught her white skirt as she bit her lip. "I don't want you fighting with your family over me."

Julian scratched his head. "I think our current situation is fine."

Jasmine nearly choked.

"You really think this is fine?" Her voice trembled. "I don't want to burden you. You should stay and marry Tiffany Sinclair!"

She turned to flee.

Julian grabbed her arm. "Don't talk nonsense! How could I ever leave you?"

"But you were supposed to be the second heir..." Tears welled in Jasmine's eyes.

"If you hadn't saved me..." Julian hesitated. "I won't abandon you."

Jasmine's blood boiled.

Who wanted to squeeze into that roach-infested apartment with him?

"I don't care!" She shook off his grip. "Stop following me!"

She dashed into the street and hailed a cab.

Julian hurried after her.

Two hours later, the taxi stopped before a dilapidated apartment building.

"One hundred seventy-eight dollars." The driver drummed his fingers on the wheel.

Julian pulled out his phone—his face drained of color.

Insufficient balance notifications flooded the screen.
###Chapter 450

Julian Valdemar stared at his phone screen, fingers trembling slightly as the insufficient balance notification glared back at him.

He had grown up in luxury, never once worrying about money.

Now he couldn't even afford a 200-dollar cab fare.

The scanner emitted a sharp, mocking beep—payment declined.

The driver's puzzled gaze met his through the rearview mirror.

Julian swallowed hard, cheeks burning with humiliation.

"Just a moment."

His grip on the phone turned his knuckles white.

Last month when rent was due, all his so-called friends had made excuses.

In the end, Jasmine Keane had quietly covered it for him.

The stern face of Adrian Valdemar flashed in his mind, instantly extinguishing any thought of asking for help.

Alexander was out of the question.

To escape the arranged marriage with the Sinclair heiress, he'd vowed to live independently for a year.

Scrolling through his contacts, only Jasmine's name remained.

"Jasmine, can you transfer me two hundred?"

The crisp click of high heels echoed through the phone.

Jasmine stood outside a boutique, admiring a limited-edition handbag in the display window.

A cold smile curled her lips.

This fool was actually begging for pocket change?

"Julian, you should go home..."

Her voice trembled with fake concern while her fingers glided over a new lipstick shade.

Sweat beaded on Julian's forehead.

"Just send the money first, okay?"

He'd given her his entire paycheck last month, then spent his savings on a gift for the Patriarch today.

The line went dead.

Redialing only produced a busy signal.

Julian froze as his phone screen darkened.

The driver sighed.

"Young man, should I call the police for you?"

Julian's head snapped up, meeting the driver's pitying stare.

Here he sat in a tailored suit—the biggest joke of all.
###Chapter 451

The taxi driver drummed his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel, brows furrowed.

"Pay up fast. Don't waste my time for the next fare."

Beads of sweat dotted Julian Valdemar's forehead as his fingers flew across his phone screen.

His contacts list stopped at "Adrian Valdemar." He closed his eyes briefly.

The call connected faster than expected.

"Well, well. The second young master actually calling me first?" Adrian's teasing voice crackled through the receiver.

Julian's Adam's apple bobbed. His voice dropped to a near whisper. "Lend me two hundred."

Dead silence on the other end.

Then a sharp curse exploded through the phone.

"Damn it! Wait there!"

Adrian stood on the banquet hall balcony, double-checking his hearing.

Julian Valdemar—the man who never carried cash—asking to borrow two hundred dollars?

His finger hovered over the transfer screen before deleting four zeros from the intended amount.

The payment notification chime sounded like salvation to Julian.

He practically fled the taxi.

The cold wind cooled his burning cheeks.

Dim hallway lights flickered in the apartment building.

Julian paused at the door, taking a deep breath before retrieving his keys.

Inside the modest two-bedroom flat, Jasmine Keane was in the midst of a rampage.

A glass shattered against the wall, shards scattering everywhere.

At the sound of turning keys, she quickly wiped her face and curled into the sofa corner.

Julian froze in the doorway.

Amidst the wreckage, Jasmine lifted tear-filled eyes.

"You...you came back?" Her voice trembled.

In three long strides, Julian gathered her into his arms.

"How could I ever leave you?"

Jasmine clutched his collar, nails nearly piercing her own palms.

"I thought you'd abandoned me..."

"Never." Julian's voice held steel.

Unseen by him, a fleeting smirk ghosted across the woman's lips.
###Chapter 452

Julian Valdemar held Jasmine Keane tightly in his arms, his fingers gently brushing the faint redness at the corners of her eyes.

A silent vow formed in his heart.

Just one more year. Once the arranged marriage with the Sinclair family was dissolved, he would give the girl in his arms the recognition she deserved.

The mess in the room couldn't dampen the warmth of this moment.

Exhausted from crying, Jasmine fell into a deep sleep against his chest.

Julian had endured too much today.

First, overtime at the company. Then, dealing with the elders at Valdemar Manor. And now, returning to find Jasmine in the midst of an emotional breakdown.

He carefully laid her down on the bed.

Despite his exhaustion, he forced himself to clean up the scattered mess.

When he opened his laptop, the clock had already struck two in the morning.

The blue glow of the screen illuminated his weary face.

This illustration gig was hard-won. He needed to finish it quickly to secure a permanent position.

Next door.

The moment the door clicked shut, Jasmine's eyes flew open.

She turned over irritably, burying her face in the pillow.

In the gardens of Valdemar Manor.

Adrian Valdemar felt a suffocating tightness in his chest after transferring money to Julian.

He pulled out a cigarette and crouched in the shadows of the flowerbed.

Wreathed in smoke, his sharp features looked even more severe.

A sudden argument reached his ears.

"What were you thinking? Letting him bring another woman here?"

The shrill voice of a middle-aged woman pierced the air.

Adrian realized he'd unintentionally become an eavesdropper.

He stubbed out his cigarette but remained still.

"Mom... It's not what you think..."

That voice made Adrian freeze.

Tiffany Sinclair.

"The marriage alliance must proceed!" The woman's tone brooked no argument. "With so many Valdemar assets at stake, you must produce an heir!"

"But—"

"No buts!"

The click of high heels faded into the distance.

Under the moonlight, Tiffany stood alone in the garden, her shoulders trembling slightly.

Almost against his will, Adrian stepped forward.

"Miss Sinclair."

Tiffany jerked her head up, her face deathly pale.

"You... heard everything?"

Adrian's chest tightened painfully at the sight of her red-rimmed eyes.

This suffocating feeling was a hundred times worse than when Julian had come to him for money.
###Chapter 453 An Unexpected Proposal

Tiffany Sinclair's fingers twisted the hem of her dress unconsciously. The tips of her ears flushed pink.

She hadn't expected to run into Adrian Valdemar at the hallway corner.

"I..." Adrian cleared his throat lightly. "Just passing by."

Tiffany pressed her lips together.

An awkward tension hung in the air.

"Actually..."

"Well..."

They spoke simultaneously and stopped at the same time.

Adrian broke the silence first. "I won't tell anyone."

The tension in Tiffany's shoulders eased slightly.

She forced a small smile. "Thanks."

Being caught in an argument with her parents was embarrassing enough. Worse that the witness was Julian Valdemar's younger brother.

"Miss Sinclair."

Adrian's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

"Are you really going through with the engagement to Julian?"

Tiffany gave a bitter smile. "It's not about whether I can back out now."

She spread her hands helplessly.

"He's in love with someone else." Adrian met her gaze directly. "And you'd still marry him?"

Tiffany's chest constricted.

His words stabbed like a knife.

Her fists clenched until nails dug into her palms.

Who cared about her feelings?

In this arranged marriage, she was just a pawn.

Julian had fallen for another, yet she bore the consequences.

"What I mean is," Adrian took a step closer, "the Valdemars have more than one suitable bachelor."

Tiffany's head jerked up.

The young man stood silhouetted against the light, his features sharply defined.

"My last name is Valdemar." His voice was soft.

Tiffany's pupils contracted.

"Consider marrying me instead."

Streetlights cast fractured shadows across Adrian's lashes.

Tiffany heard the violent pounding of her own heartbeat.

"I'm older than you..." Her voice trembled.

Adrian's throat moved. "Only by two years."

Night wind slipped between them.

Tiffany found it hard to breathe.

"Give me some time..."
###Chapter 454 

Tiffany Sinclair's fingers unconsciously twisted the hem of her skirt.

She had known since childhood that she was destined to marry Julian Valdemar, the second son of the Valdemar family.

For this arranged marriage, she had memorized all of Julian's preferences. He loved navy blue, hated sweets, and always took his coffee with three sugar cubes.

Three months ago, she'd even taken a knife for Julian.

Yet now, Julian stood embracing another woman, declaring he would marry no one else.

"Will you marry me?"

Adrian Valdemar's voice made Tiffany's head snap up. Her fiancé's younger brother gazed at her with smiling peach-blossom eyes.

"I..." Tiffany's lips parted soundlessly.

Adrian chuckled, reaching to brush a windblown strand of hair from her face.

"No rush." His fingertips barely grazed her earlobe. "Take your time."

He turned to leave, then suddenly pivoted back.

"Actually..." Adrian rubbed his nose and pulled out his phone. "Let's exchange contacts first?"

As if bewitched, Tiffany handed over her phone.

Only when Adrian's silhouette disappeared down the corridor did she snap out of her daze.

She'd just exchanged numbers with her fiancé's brother?

Even more absurd—he'd just proposed to her!

Tiffany crouched down, pressing her burning cheeks into her palms.

Strangely, the suffocating resentment in her chest had eased considerably.

At least Adrian's eyes held no trace of that "must-marry" woman.

But he was Julian's brother...

Biting her lip, Tiffany rose—unaware that Adrian still watched from the second-floor window, staring at her flushed ears.

＊

The banquet hall finally quieted.

Alexander Valdemar saw off the last guest before approaching the corner sofa.

"Tired?"

Sophia Laurent looked up from scrolling through social media. Her afternoon nap left her eyes bright as stars.

"Not sleepy."

Alexander ruffled her hair. The familiar scent of winter pine made Sophia's heart skip.

"Let's retire."

Moonlight silvered the courtyard. Their shadows merged on the cobblestone path as crickets chirped in the grass.

Alexander's bedroom maintained minimalist elegance. The walk-in closet already held a section for Sophia.

Dresses with tags still attached hung in perfect rows—all in her exact size.
###Chapter 455

Steam swirled in the bathroom. Pregnancy-safe toiletries were neatly arranged on the shelf.

Alexander finished listing precautions, his gaze lingering on Sophia. "You go first. I'll wait outside."

Sophia chuckled. "I'm not a child who'll slip in the shower."

"Better safe than sorry." His brow furrowed. "Should I ask Aunt Sunny to assist you?"

"No!" She waved dismissively. "It's too late for that."

The shower started running as she stepped inside.

Alexander sat on the couch outside, an unread financial magazine in his hands. The sound of water pattering against tiles clawed at his patience like a kitten's persistent scratching.

When the door creaked open, his head snapped up.

The white silk nightgown clung to Sophia's curves. Water droplets slid down her damp hair. A rosy flush colored her cheeks, her collarbones peeking through the delicate fabric.

Her bare feet sank into the plush carpet, toes curling adorably.

Alexander's throat moved visibly. His stare became fixed.

Sophia had deliberately taken her time, assuming he'd left. Finding those dark eyes still trained on her, she froze.

"You're... still here?" Her voice tightened.

He abruptly looked away, voice gruff. "In case you needed anything."

Kneeling, he slid slippers onto her feet. "The floor's cold."

Sophia watched the top of his head, heart fluttering. No one had ever tended to her with such care.

"Thank you."

"Don't mention it." Rising, his ears turned pink. "I'm next door if you need me."

He retreated hastily, his departure almost comically abrupt.
###Chapter 456

Sophia Laurent arched an eyebrow as she watched Alexander Valdemar's retreating figure.

There was an unmistakable air of disarray in his hurried departure.

She didn't dwell on it, pulling the covers over herself as she settled into bed.

The faint, crisp scent of cedar lingered on the pillow, lulling her swiftly into sleep.

Next door.

Alexander strode directly into the bathroom.

The showerhead hissed to life, icy water cascading down.

Droplets traced the defined planes of his torso before vanishing.

He tilted his head back, allowing the frigid stream to douse his burning skin.

Fragmented memories from the gala night flashed through his mind.

The warmth of her touch. The sweetness of her fragrance. His throat tightened.

The water turned glacial.

That night.

Some slept soundly.

Others lay awake.

And one man seethed with rage.

Police station.

Ryan Cunningham and Emily Lowell emerged from giving their statements well past midnight.

"Ryan, this is all my fault..." Emily's eyes gleamed with unshed tears.

She hadn't anticipated Alexander disregarding the Cunningham family's standing for Sophia's sake.

Their families had maintained surface civility despite years of rivalry.

What made Sophia so special?

Ryan snapped back to the present, ruffling her hair.

"Don't worry. After resolving the medical robotics project, I'll personally visit Patriarch Valdemar for answers."

A dangerous glint flickered in his eyes.

"Sophia pushed you first, yet you're the one suffering consequences."

Emily's chest warmed.

Rising on her toes, she whispered into his ear.

Ryan's pupils contracted sharply. "You're certain?"

His voice trembled with barely contained excitement.

Emily's lips curved. "Have I ever lied to you?"

He swept her into his arms, spinning them both.

"You're my lucky charm, Emily."

Her lashes fluttered downward.

"But I'm not a real Lowell... Does that truly not matter to you?"
###Chapter 457

The Valdemar Manor was ablaze with lights.

The prestigious Valdemar family, known for rarely hosting social events, had unexpectedly sent invitations to all the elite families in the city.

Nearly every invited guest had arrived.

Only the Valdemars were absent.

To be precise, no invitation had been extended to them.

Madam Valdemar had considered everything carefully. She feared her daughter Sophia might reignite her obsession with Alexander Valdemar if she saw him tonight.

Standing radiantly at the center of the grand hall, Madam Valdemar had her daughter Sophia on her left and her eldest niece, Hailey, on her right.

Hailey held her son Yangyang's hand.

Due to her figure, Hailey hadn't opted for an evening gown. Instead, she wore a brand-new tailored suit, complemented by delicate makeup and the jewelry gifted by Madam Valdemar. The ensemble exuded an air of understated elegance.

Yangyang, dressed in a perfectly fitted little suit, looked even more adorable. Initially shy, the boy quickly adjusted to the lively atmosphere. Whenever someone praised his looks, he responded with sweet gratitude, gradually becoming the center of attention.

"Madam, Mrs. Lu and the fourth young master of the Lu family have arrived," the butler announced.

Madam Valdemar's eyes lit up. She immediately took Hailey's hand. "Come, let's greet our distinguished guests."

In a hushed tone, she explained, "Mrs. Lu is Lucas Lu's mother. He's helped you quite a bit before."

Hailey nodded in understanding.

Tonight's banquet was Madam Valdemar's declaration to the entire city—the Hailey sisters now had the backing of the Valdemar Group.

As the trio reached the center of the courtyard, they encountered Mrs. Lu and her son approaching.

"Mrs. Lu, Young Master Lu."

"Madam Valdemar."

The two noblewomen exchanged warm greetings as if they were lifelong friends, though in reality, they rarely acknowledged each other in passing.

The Lu family, being close allies of the Valdemars, shouldn't have attended this event.

But tonight was different.

Mrs. Lu had made an exception solely because her youngest son, Lucas, had insisted on accompanying her. His unusual eagerness piqued her curiosity—what could possibly have drawn her socially averse son to the Valdemar gathering?

After exchanging pleasantries, the two matriarchs began complimenting each other's children.

When the conversation turned to Hailey, Mrs. Lu finally took notice of the unfamiliar face.

"This must be your niece?"

Madam Valdemar proudly clasped Hailey's hand. "This is my eldest niece, Hailey. Unfortunately, her younger sister couldn't join us tonight due to prior commitments."

"Yangyang."

Lucas suddenly crouched down, reaching to touch the boy's cheek. The little one looked irresistibly charming in his tiny suit.

But Yangyang shrank back like a startled rabbit, hiding behind his mother.

Lucas's hand hung awkwardly mid-air.

He stood up with a wry smile. "Why does he always hide from me?"

Mrs. Lu sensed something amiss. "Lucas, do you know Miss Hailey?"

"She used to work at my company. Resigned not long ago," Lucas admitted truthfully.

Yangyang peeked out from behind Hailey, eyeing Lucas cautiously. Noticing this, Lucas immediately flashed a bright smile and clapped his hands, signaling that he wanted to hold the boy.
###Chapter 458

Ryan Cunningham held Emily Lowell in his arms, his fingers gently stroking her hair.

"Emily, this is crucial," he murmured, his voice low. "We need a professional team to ensure everything goes smoothly."

Emily rested her head against his chest, her lashes fluttering.

"Alright," she nodded. "I'll go with you."

Since their marriage, she had already considered herself part of the Cunningham family.

A flicker of satisfaction crossed Ryan's eyes.

He leaned down and pressed a kiss to her forehead.

"You always understand me so well."

The disastrous box office performance of "River Banquet" sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry.

Richard Lowell, once hailed as a golden director, had become a laughingstock.

Lowell Entertainment suffered even greater losses.

After the Derek Langley scandal, artists began terminating their contracts en masse.

Now, even the last remaining key employees had jumped ship.

The once-glorious entertainment giant was reduced to an empty shell.

The business world was equally turbulent.

After Alexander Valdemar took over Valdemar Holdings, he immediately severed all ties with Lowell Group.

Other corporations quickly followed suit.

Lowell Group's stock prices plummeted.

Yet, William Lowell had been in high spirits lately.

Dr. Preston Quincy's scientific breakthrough had given him hope for a comeback.

"With this technology, the Lowell family will soon reclaim its former glory."

His fingers trembled slightly as he announced the news to the entire family.

That evening, Lowell Group's official website released a statement.

Dr. Preston Quincy would hold a press conference.

The business world was stunned.

No one had expected the enigmatic genius scientist to be connected to the Lowells.

Two years ago, his medical robot had revolutionized the healthcare industry.

Now, his new breakthrough was poised to create an even greater impact.

William's phone began ringing off the hook.

Old friends who had distanced themselves suddenly became warm and chatty.

Powerful figures who had once been out of reach now extended olive branches.

Countless collaboration offers poured in like snowflakes.

Standing before the floor-to-ceiling window, he gazed down at the city lights.

"Sophia Laurent, did you really think you could bring down the Lowell family?"

A cold smirk curled his lips.
###Chapter 459

William Lowell would personally usher in the golden age of Lowell Group.

After announcing the collaboration with Dr. Preston Quincy, William finally felt a long-lost sense of relief.

The entire Lowell household was immersed in celebration.

Even Richard Lowell, who had been bedridden, was discharged early due to his improved mood and returned home to recuperate.

Investors of "River Banquet" didn’t hold the box office failure against them. Instead, they scrambled to curry favor, hoping to secure a stake in Dr. Quincy’s groundbreaking project.

Richard listened to their flattery with a beaming smile, his previous gloom completely dispelled.

He even began inquiring about Emily’s marriage prospects.

"Emily, how are things going with Ryan lately?"

Richard was already envisioning an alliance with the Cunningham family once the Lowells rose to greater prominence—perhaps even surpassing the Valdemars.

Then that ungrateful Sophia would never trouble him again.

Emily smiled sweetly. "Dad, Ryan mentioned his parents will soon come to propose."

"Excellent! Truly excellent!"

Richard set down his teacup, his face glowing with delight. "This calls for a double celebration!"

He gazed at Emily with affection. "You’ve always been the blessing of this family. Your parents made the right choice by switching you with Sophia back then."

Compared to the rebellious Sophia, he far preferred this obedient and sensible adopted daughter.

Victoria Lowell also re-entered high society with renewed vigor.

Invitations poured in—shopping, mahjong, spa treatments—her schedule packed to the brim.

Gone was her previous despondency; she now radiated vitality.

Daniel and Nathan Lowell continued their carefree lifestyles.

They either lazed at home or indulged in revelry outside, living without a care in the world.

With Lowell Group as their safety net, the future held no worries for them.

The day of the press conference arrived in the blink of an eye.

The venue was packed to the brim with media and medical professionals.

All eyes were on Dr. Quincy’s latest breakthrough.

Two years prior, his surgical robotics had revolutionized the medical field.

Rumors suggested this new invention could perform even more intricate cardiac and orthopedic procedures.

William stood tall in a tailored black suit, every inch the elite businessman.

Richard looked spry in his traditional attire, while Victoria shimmered in an embroidered qipao and jewels.

They flanked Dr. Quincy, awaiting their grand entrance.

Suddenly, the doctor’s assistant rushed in, panic-stricken.

"Doctor, there’s an emergency—"
###Chapter 460

Dr. Preston Quincy adjusted his gold-rimmed glasses. The cuffs of his white dress shirt were rolled up to his elbows, revealing a discreet mechanical watch on his wrist.

William Lowell was straightening his tie when his assistant stumbled into the conference room.

"Disgraceful!" William slammed the table. "Don't you know we have a product launch today?"

Beads of sweat formed on the assistant's forehead. He first bowed to William, then turned to Dr. Quincy. "Doctor... the core database has been wiped clean."

Christopher Lowell shot up from his chair, the legs screeching against the floor.

"Say that again?" He grabbed the assistant's collar. "Do you know the prison sentence for falsifying trade secrets?"

The assistant turned pale, casting a pleading look at Dr. Quincy.

The doctor pressed his hand over Christopher's knuckles, where veins bulged. "Let him finish."

"This morning when I went to retrieve the presentation materials..." The assistant's voice trembled. "All encrypted files were gone. Including the robot prototype designs and algorithm codes..."

The central air conditioning in the lab suddenly hummed to life.

Dr. Quincy's fountain pen slipped from his fingers, leaving an ink blot on the contract.

"What about the security system?" His voice turned sharp. "Who was the last to leave the lab last night?"

The assistant shook his head. "The surveillance room reported system anomalies at 3 AM..."

Christopher suddenly lunged, pinning the assistant against the wall. "Was this an inside job?"

His distorted reflection glared back from the glass partition.

"Christopher!" William barked. "To the server room first!"

As Dr. Quincy bent to retrieve his pen, he noticed his fingers trembling uncontrollably. Two years and four months of research data. Thirty-six thousand lines of core code. All possibly auctioned off on some dark web marketplace.

The assistant coughed, rubbing his throat. "Doctor... the launch event..."

Outside, giant banners for the press conference were being raised. The metallic head of the surgical automaton glinted coldly under the sunlight.
###Chapter 461

Dr. Preston Quincy frowned deeply, his fingers resting lightly on William Lowell's shoulder.

"Don't panic. The data can be reorganized. It'll take three weeks at most to recover everything."

His words sounded reassuring, but everyone present knew better.

The mysterious disappearance of research materials at this critical juncture was no accident.

In scientific research, the first-mover advantage is everything.

If someone else published first, even perfect replication would diminish their breakthrough's impact.

Dr. Quincy turned to Richard Lowell with a nod.

"Mr. Lowell, I'll go assess the situation."

He hurried after William with his assistant.

Richard immediately stood up, following closely.

Mrs. Lowell looked distraught, abandoning all press conference arrangements to join them.

Everyone understood - if Dr. Quincy's research was truly compromised, the Lowell family would fall from grace.

The press conference venue buzzed with activity.

Though scheduled for 10 AM, reporters had arrived by 7 AM to secure prime spots.

Medical experts from across the country came a day early to witness this historic moment.

All anticipated today would mark a breakthrough in medical robotics.

As time ticked by, anticipation grew.

At 10 AM sharp, spotlights illuminated the empty stage.

The crowd waited patiently.

By 10:30, the stage remained silent.

Reporters began questioning staff.

But the staff were equally confused.

The Lowell men had left without informing anyone.

William's assistant only discovered their absence upon opening the green room.

Unanswered phone calls left no choice but to address the crowd.

Meanwhile, at Lowell Group's laboratory...

William's voice trembled. "Dr. Quincy, could there be some mistake? The data was definitely here."

Dr. Quincy's fingers flew across the keyboard.

With each keystroke, his expression darkened further.

William held his breath, clinging to fading hope.

Finally, Dr. Quincy stopped typing.

"Mr. Lowell, the files are indeed gone from this system."

He booted up a backup computer.

"The duplicates have vanished too."

This confirmation shattered William's last shred of hope.

"How? Our lab has top-tier security! We have cybersecurity experts! How could data just disappear?"

Suddenly grasping at straws, he insisted:

"Dr. Quincy, call the tech team! We must recover this data! The press conference cannot be canceled!"
###Chapter 462 

The technical director's fingers flew across the keyboard in the surveillance room.

"I checked the system immediately after Assistant Chen left." Beads of sweat formed on his forehead. "The intruder was highly skilled. They wiped all research data and implanted a destructive virus."

William Lowell's face turned ashen.

"Pull up the surveillance footage. Now!"

The entire research facility occupied the top floor of the Lowell Tower with multi-layered encrypted security. Not even a fly could enter without authorization.

The data couldn't have vanished without inside help.

There was only one explanation.

A mole lurked within Dr. Quincy's team.

William clenched his fists until his nails bit into his palms. This project was the Lowell Group's last hope for revival.

Who wanted to destroy them?

His eyes darkened with fury.

Sophia Laurent—who else?

That woman had climbed to power by stepping over the Lowells. Now she aimed to wipe them out completely?

If she was truly behind this...

William took a deep breath, forcing himself to remain composed.

"Lock down the entire floor." He ordered the security chief. "No one leaves."

"Understood."

Static crackled over the radio as black-clad security personnel swarmed the top level within moments.

Inside the lab, researchers exchanged uneasy glances.

Assistant Chen's palms grew clammy. He subtly positioned himself in front of Dr. Quincy.

The scientist remained unruffled.

"Dr. Quincy." William's voice dripped with ice. "I'm well aware of your connection to Sophia Laurent."

He advanced slowly. "But remember—your lab operates on Lowell property. The contract clearly states all research belongs to us."

Dr. Quincy arched an eyebrow. "Are you accusing me?"

"I'd prefer not to." William smirked coldly. "Then why did this happen right before the press conference?"

He slammed a hand on the table. "This is sabotage!"

Over the past month, Lowell stocks had tripled thanks to this breakthrough. State hospitals, private institutions, even Valdemar Medical had extended offers.

William had relished the thought of humbling the Valdemars.

Now if news of the data breach leaked...

The Lowells wouldn't just crash—they'd be finished.

"Investigate!"

He ground out the word through clenched teeth, veins bulging at his temples.
###Chapter 463

"No one but Sophia Laurent would deal such a devastating blow to the Lowell Group."

William Lowell advanced step by step, stopping directly before Dr. Preston Quincy.

"And you happen to be her old acquaintance."

Richard Lowell's expression darkened instantly, his fingers digging into his palms.

"That wretched girl! I should've strangled her at birth!"

Victoria Lowell stamped her feet anxiously, tears welling in her eyes.

"Dr. Quincy, we've treated you well..."

The recent glamour had intoxicated her. Though she didn't understand the technicalities, she recognized the gravity of the situation.

Dr. Quincy remained composed. "The research institute's funding came from Sophia's personal account."

"The contract was also signed with her."

This statement ignited William's fury.

"That money belongs to the Lowells!"

His eyes turned venomous. "Don't forget your wife and children are still in the capital."

Dr. Quincy frowned slightly.

Not from fear.

Sophia had already relocated his family to safety.

But from disappointment.

Sophia had never interfered with his research, nor prevented his collaboration with the Lowells.

Yet William assumed the worst motives.

Recalling how William had proudly shown Emily around the institute days ago, Dr. Quincy smirked.

"Let's first investigate the breach."

Richard quickly mediated. "William's young and hot-headed. Please don't take offense, Dr. Quincy."

Dr. Quincy nodded impassively. "I won't hold it against him."

There would be no further dealings anyway.

The surveillance footage was promptly retrieved.

But all company recordings from the past week had been erased.

The tech team admitted defeat. "The data is irrecoverable."

William overturned a table in rage. "Incompetent fools!"

Then a research technician stepped forward.

"The videos can be restored."

While research data used specialized encryption, the surveillance system employed standard deletion.

William's expression softened slightly. "Do it now."

The rhythmic clatter of keyboards echoed sharply in the silent conference room.
###Chapter 464

Data recovery would take time.

William Lowell stormed toward Dr. Preston Quincy with a dark expression.

"Dr. Quincy, lend me your phone."

His gaze locked onto the screen of Quincy's device.

Quincy frowned at him.

"Fine."

He unlocked the phone and handed it over without hesitation.

William immediately scrolled to the contacts.

Sophia Laurent's name stood out prominently.

The call connected after just a few rings.

"Good morning, Dr. Quincy."

Sophia's lazy voice drifted through the speaker.

"Sophia!"

William spat her name through gritted teeth.

"William?"

Her tone instantly sharpened.

"You stole the Lowell Group's research. Feeling proud of yourself?"

His voice dripped with venom.

"Without Dr. Quincy's work, the Lowell family is finished!"

A brief silence stretched on the other end.

"What are you talking about? The research was stolen?"

Genuine surprise colored her words.

"Stop playing dumb!"

William's roar echoed through the room.

"The surveillance footage will be restored soon. You'll be behind bars by then!"

A soft chuckle answered him.

"Dr. Quincy's institute is solely funded by me. There's no contractual relationship with the Lowell Group."

The sound of a coffee cup being set down followed.

"Does conducting research in your building automatically make the results yours?"

William's face turned ashen.

"You planned this humiliation from the start?"

"No."

Her voice turned icy.

"If I truly wanted to act, you wouldn't even have made it to the press conference."

"So you admit it?"

His fists clenched.

The delicate clink of porcelain punctuated the tense silence.
###Chapter 465

"Have you lost your mind? When did I ever say I took the research findings?" Sophia let out a light laugh, her tone laced with sarcasm.

William Lowell gritted his teeth. "Who else would hate the Lowell family this much besides you?"

"Sophia, just you wait," he hissed, his voice dripping with venom. "If anything happens to the Lowells, I'll drag you down with me."

Her eyes turned icy.

"Then let me ask you this, William," she drawled. "When you find the real culprit, will you make sure they rot in prison too?"

"Of course!" William snapped. "Who else could it be? The surveillance footage is being restored as we speak. Let's see how you talk your way out of this!"

Sophia suddenly smiled. "Then I wish you the best of luck."

The sound of William's labored breathing came through the phone.

"Stop spouting nonsense!"

Victoria Lowell took the phone, her voice trembling. "Sophia, I'm begging you..."

"That research is incredibly important. Could you please—"

Click.

Sophia hung up without hesitation.

She stared at her phone for a few seconds before deciding to visit the research institute herself.

At the institute, Victoria clutched the disconnected phone, her face pale.

"Mom, don't upset yourself." William seethed. "Sophia is nothing but an ungrateful wretch. She's nothing like Emily."

Victoria opened her mouth but couldn't bring herself to argue.

A memory flashed through her mind—Sophia as a child, gazing up at her with bright, hopeful eyes.

"Mr. Lowell, the surveillance footage has been restored!" a technician suddenly announced.

William smirked. "Let's see her deny this!"

Everyone gathered around the screen.

The footage showed two figures, bundled up and moving furtively through the company.

"It's her!" William pointed at the screen.

Dr. Quincy shook his head. "That's not Ms. Laurent."

"What do you mean it's not?" William snapped.

"This woman is five centimeters shorter than Ms. Laurent and has a fuller build," Dr. Quincy pointed out. "And the hair color is wrong."

Upon closer inspection, the discrepancies became obvious.

Sophia stood at 168 centimeters, while the figure in the footage couldn't be taller than 165.
###Chapter 466

Sophia Laurent's slender frame showed no signs of pregnancy, her waist still delicately narrow.

The intruding woman was noticeably fuller, with a thicker waistline.

The subtle differences were hard to detect at first glance.

The most striking contrast was their hair.

Sophia's raven-black tresses cascaded like silk.

The woman in surveillance footage, though heavily bundled, revealed caramel-colored curls.

These details proved she wasn't Sophia.

William Lowell remained obstinate.

"Surveillance distorts images. Weight gain is normal during pregnancy. As for the hair, she might've dyed it as disguise."

Brows furrowed at his claim, but no one objected.

The possibility existed.

When the pair headed straight for the CEO's private elevator, William froze.

Others remained focused on the screens, missing his sudden pallor.

Sophia had never possessed elevator clearance.

Even during her internship at Lowell Group since college, William had denied her privileges.

She'd always used the staff elevator with other employees.

The two elevators stood at opposite ends of the lobby.

Footage showed them ascending directly to the 32nd floor executive suite.

Without pause, they proceeded to Dr. Preston Quincy's rooftop lab.

The black-clad woman moved with unsettling familiarity.

She swiped an access card through the first security checkpoint.

The coded door yielded to her touch.

Finally, the biometric scanner.

She pressed a synthetic fingertip against the sensor. The light turned green.

Three-tiered security collapsed like dominoes.

Such intimate knowledge of the lab raised fresh suspicions.

Who else but Sophia could navigate the facility this flawlessly?

Dr. Quincy spoke abruptly. "Pull last night's access logs. Verify the fingerprints."

Technicians worked swiftly.

When data flashed across screens, collective gasps erupted.

Records showed the 11:36 PM lab entry fingerprint belonged to William Lowell, current CEO of Lowell Group.

Dozens of accusatory stares pinned the man at the room's center.

"Mr. Lowell, where were you at this time last night?"

Dr. Quincy's question landed like a thunderclap.

William's temple vein bulged. "Dr. Quincy, are you implying something?"
###Chapter 467

William Lowell shook his head slowly.
"I'm not accusing you. I just need to confirm who had access to your fingerprints recently."

Sophia Laurent's pupils constricted sharply.

The realization hit him like a thunderbolt.
Someone had stolen his fingerprints to infiltrate the research facility.
The access card used was his spare—the one kept in his desk drawer.

Every detail sent chills down his spine.

His assistant interjected suddenly.
"Mr. Lowell, didn't you give your sister a tour of the facility last month?"

Emily Lowell's visit had left an impression on every researcher present.

"The woman on surveillance footage also had caramel-colored hair and a similar—"

"Enough!" William snapped.

The assistant recoiled under his glacial stare.

Richard Lowell noticed the tension immediately.
"Who did you bring into the facility?"

William's legs turned to jelly.
Cold sweat beaded on his forehead.

He should have known.
That woman's mannerisms—they matched Emily perfectly.
And the only person who'd been near him frequently was Emily.

Sophia would never have had the opportunity to obtain his fingerprints.

This revelation froze the blood in his veins.

He had pointed fingers at Sophia with such conviction.
Now the evidence pointed elsewhere.

"Is it Sophia?" Richard pressed.

The conference room plunged into silence.

Dr. Preston Quincy opened his mouth to speak, but William cut in first.
"Father, please wait in my office. I'll handle this."

Richard studied his son for a long moment before turning away.
Victoria Lowell followed her husband in confusion.

William bowed deeply to Dr. Quincy.
"My apologies for my earlier rudeness."

"No matter." The scientist adjusted his glasses calmly.
"Data recovery takes time."

"How long?"

"Ms. Laurent has already made our position clear." Dr. Quincy's tone remained even but firm.
"Our research facility has no contractual ties with Lowell Enterprises."

He pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose.
"We're relocating. You may bill us for any outstanding facility fees."

"Absolutely not!" William slammed his palms on the table as he shot to his feet.
###Chapter 468

William Lowell had intended to ask Dr. Preston Quincy to reorganize the research data.

Even if they missed the first opportunity, they could still secure a share of the profits.

But Dr. Quincy's response caught him off guard—he politely declined the request.

"The research institute's funding was provided personally by Sophia Laurent," Dr. Quincy stated calmly.

William wiped sweat from his forehead. "Sophia's money belongs to the Lowell family. She represents Lowell Entertainment."

Dr. Quincy frowned slightly and fell silent.

"Dr. Quincy, please reconsider. Lowell Entertainment will ensure you're generously compensated."

With that, William hurriedly left the institute.

He ordered the entire facility sealed, prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving. All communications were cut off.

When he returned to his office, Richard and Victoria Lowell were already waiting.

To his surprise, Daniel and Nathan Lowell, who had been absent for some time, had also arrived.

"Brother, what's going on?"

Though the brothers had kept a low profile recently, news of Lowell Entertainment's press conference had reached them.

When the event failed to start on time, they called their father.

Richard gave vague answers, only saying there was an issue and urging them to come immediately.

William looked at his brothers' confused expressions and let out a heavy sigh, his energy completely drained.

The mere thought of the possibility made it hard to breathe.

"Dr. Quincy's research... was stolen."

Nathan shot to his feet. "How is that possible? Dr. Quincy has lived in seclusion for years, keeping to himself. How could his work suddenly be stolen?"

Daniel's face darkened as a thought flashed through his mind.

He remained silent, his gaze fixed on William.

William took a deep breath, struggling to find the right words.

He couldn't bring himself to say it—the thief was Emily Lowell, the girl they had doted on since childhood.

If Sophia had done it, he might have accepted it.

But it was their beloved adopted daughter.

William's silence led Richard to the wrong conclusion.

"It must be that wretched Sophia!" Richard slammed his fist on the table. "She deliberately humiliated Lowell Entertainment in front of everyone!"

Victoria quietly wiped away tears but didn't argue.

William flushed red. "Father, it's not—"

He wanted to explain it wasn't Sophia.

But before he could finish, Nathan interrupted. "Father, are you sure?"

He hadn't been completely idle during this time. He'd secretly investigated Sophia and Emily's past.

The results shocked him.

Their entire family had been deceived.

Sophia had never harmed anyone, while Emily had been living a double life.

"How could it be false?" Richard gritted his teeth, his eyes burning with hatred.
###Chapter 469

"Who else but Sophia Laurent would be so desperate to ruin us?"

Daniel Lowell's fingers absently traced the cuff of his suit sleeve.

The memory of Sophia shining at the design awards sent a dull ache through his chest.

"Evidence?"

A cool female voice cut through the tension.

Everyone turned to see Sophia leaning against the doorframe. The champagne-colored dress hugged her slender waist, while diamonds at her throat scattered light like shattered stars.

Two black-clad bodyguards flanked her.

"Found the surveillance footage?" Sophia's lips curved. "Or am I the scapegoat again?"

Her stilettos clicked against marble as she entered the boardroom.

William Lowell's back grew damp with sweat.

"You're not welcome here."

"Just helping a friend." Sophia's gaze swept the room. "Seems Lowell Entertainment is falling apart without me."

Her eyes landed on Dr. Quincy's research documents.

"A Lowell employee?" She arched a brow. "That justifies theft?"

Richard Lowell snatched an ashtray.

"Ungrateful wretch!"

The glass hurtled through the air.

A bodyguard's kick sent it exploding against the wall. Shards rained down, leaving a bleeding gash on Richard's cheek.

Sophia didn't even blink.

"My doing?" She tilted her head. "Or the thief's?"

She pulled out her phone with a flick of the wrist.

"Shall we call the police?"

Richard's facial muscles twitched violently.

A crimson bead rolled down his wound.
###Chapter 470

Richard Lowell's words hissed through clenched teeth, dripping with venomous hatred.

"You stole my company's trade secrets. That's a felony! Not even the Valdemars can protect you now."

Sophia Laurent met his venomous glare with a mocking smile.

"And what does Chairman Lowell plan to do about it?"

His knuckles turned white from gripping the table.

"Return what you stole, and I'll pretend this never happened. Otherwise, I'll make sure you rot in prison."

Slow claps echoed through the boardroom.

"Such touching paternal love."

Her smile vanished, replaced by glacial indifference.

"But I'll pass on being your daughter. That misfortune belongs to someone else."

William Lowell's temple throbbed as he listened.

"Sophia, this doesn't concern you. Leave now."

He needed to get her out before she discovered Dr. Quincy's confinement.

Richard slammed both palms on the table.

"She's not leaving this room! Even if we have to involve the Valdemars, we're in the right here."

His glare burned into Sophia.

"Let's see if the Valdemars still want a thieving traitor in their family."

William sighed at his father's deranged expression.

"Father, Sophia didn't do it."

She couldn't have accessed the executive elevator or obtained his fingerprints.

The framing was too sloppy.

Richard froze. "Then who?"

His face darkened. "Dr. Quincy swore he saw you taking your sister upstairs!"

Daniel and Nathan exchanged knowing glances.

Victoria remained confused.

Sophia burst into laughter.

"Hahaha..."

She watched Richard's shifting expression with amusement.

"Which sister would warrant William's personal escort, I wonder?"

Victoria's eyes widened. "Emily? Emily Lowell?"

Richard looked thunderstruck. "You're saying Emily stole the research?"

William nodded grimly.

All evidence pointed to Emily.

Her sudden request to visit the top floor had been premeditated.

Richard refused to believe it. "Are you certain Sophia didn't impersonate her?"

His obedient adopted daughter wouldn't betray him.

William met his father's devastated gaze. "I'm certain."

Silence swallowed the boardroom.
###Chapter 471 

Dr. Preston Quincy stood aside, his eyes flickering uncertainly. His demeanor clearly indicated he had no objections to Sophia Laurent taking the research findings at any time.

"Impossible!"

Richard Lowell suddenly clutched his chest as blood spurted from his mouth.

"Call Emily here immediately! I need to question her face to face!"

Victoria Lowell frantically supported him. "Richard, calm down. Sit and rest first..."

Daniel Lowell and Nathan Lowell both paled. "Dad, don't get agitated. This isn't as serious as it seems..."

Despite their words, both brothers knew this scandal could devastate Lowell Entertainment.

Daniel clenched his fists until his nails dug into his palms. He recalled forcing Sophia into that sham marriage with the comatose man for Emily's sake. The absurdity of it now made him sick.

Nathan remained eerily calm. This outcome felt almost expected to him.

William Lowell closed his eyes briefly before dialing Emily's number and putting it on speakerphone.

"Big brother? The press conference is about to start. Why call now?"

The sweet voice from the receiver now sounded unbearably grating.

When Emily had requested leave for a "vacation abroad" two days prior, Richard had approved without hesitation.

All lies.

"Where are you now?" William demanded.

"The Maldives! The ocean is still so blue here. Want to join me, big brother?"

William's face darkened. Had he not seen the surveillance footage himself, he might have softened again.

"Is that so?"

Emily instantly detected the shift in tone, her voice turning saccharine. "Don't you trust me, brother?"

"Of course I do," William replied mechanically before pivoting sharply. "There's been an incident at the company. Dr. Quincy's research was stolen."

"What?" Emily gasped theatrically. "How could this happen?"

Listening to her feigned shock, William's heart turned to ice.

"The surveillance footage has been recovered."

Dead silence filled the line.

After several seconds, Emily chuckled lightly. "So this is an interrogation now?"

"Not an interrogation," William enunciated each word. "A confirmation."

He drew a deep breath before voicing the question burning in his chest:

"Why would you do this?"
###Chapter 472

The silence on the other end of the line stretched for a full minute.

When Emily Lowell finally spoke, all pretense had vanished from her voice.

"Since you already know everything, there's no point in me continuing this act."

Her tone turned icy and detached, completely different from before.

"William, you always claim to treat me like a real sister. So what's wrong with me taking what belongs to my own family?"

William Lowell's fingers tightened around his phone.

"Emily, what exactly are you trying to do?" His voice strained. "Do you understand how important this research is to Lowell Enterprises?"

A soft chuckle came through the line.

"Didn't you promise to give me anything I wanted?"

William swallowed hard, momentarily speechless.

"But this is different..."

"How?" Emily interrupted. "Because this time it affects your precious profits?"

Richard Lowell snatched the phone away, his voice stern.

"Return the materials immediately, or face the consequences."

Emily's tone instantly shifted to one of sorrow.

"Daddy, you said you'd always cherish me..."

Her voice trembled with fake tears. "Now you won't even grant me this small request?"

Victoria Lowell moved closer to the receiver.

"Emily, please return the documents. Mommy promises not to blame you."

Emily's lips curled into a cold smile.

"Sorry, Mother. I can't do that."

She absently twisted the wedding band on her finger, eyes flashing with triumph.

Richard exploded with rage.

"After everything the Lowells have done for you, this is how you repay us?"

"Repay?" Emily laughed lightly. "I've already handed the materials to the Cunninghams. Consider it my dowry."

The call ended abruptly.
###Chapter 473

Twilight descended as city lights flickered to life.

Sophia Laurent stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows of a skyscraper, her stiletto heels clicking against the marble. She swirled the crimson wine in her glass, the liquid catching the light against her sharp profile.

Her phone vibrated.

A cold smile curled her lips as she glanced at the caller ID.

"Ms. Laurent, we've confirmed it," her assistant's voice came through the line. "The Lockwood Group has been secretly acquiring our shares."

The crystal glass clinked against the marble countertop as she set it down.

"Keep monitoring them," she commanded, her voice icy. "And prepare a financial report on Lockwood Group for the past three years."

Ending the call, Sophia turned toward her desk. The black bodycon dress swayed with each step, accentuating her curves.

The computer screen illuminated as she typed her password.

An encrypted file appeared.

Her fingers hovered over the keyboard before clicking open a photograph. A well-dressed man laughed with a blonde woman at some high-society event.

Sophia tapped her manicured nail against the desk.

"Leonard Lockwood, some things never change."

Neon lights glittered beyond the windows, the cityscape holding its secrets close.

She snapped the laptop shut and grabbed her car keys.

Her stilettos struck the marble with purposeful clicks.

Tonight, she would pay an old friend a visit.

"My Lord, I truly don't know!"

Black Demon wiped his tears, voice trembling. He curled up in the corner like a frightened child.

"After being enveloped by the demon sword fragments, I lost all awareness." He glanced around fearfully. "This place is too sinister!"

His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard.

"The space keeps changing unpredictably—sometimes vast beyond measure, other times so cramped I can't even turn around." His hands shook. "There's no discernible pattern."

Chen Zongheng arched an eyebrow. "How long have you been here?"

"I've been counting." Black Demon pouted pitifully, counting on his fingers. "In two more minutes, it'll be exactly ten years."

Chen's pupils constricted. He'd assumed mere days had passed, not a decade!

Was time flowing differently here?

He instructed Black Demon to keep counting while he stepped into an adjacent space. Returning one minute later, he found Black Demon holding up a single finger.

"One minute?" Chen exhaled in relief.

"One year!" Black Demon nearly wailed. "My Lord, you were gone for an entire year!"

Skeptical, Chen conducted another experiment. This time he had Black Demon time his absence while holding the demon sword.

The results were more absurd—Black Demon claimed another decade had passed, while Chen experienced only an instant.

"My Lord, please stop toying with me!" Black Demon collapsed to his knees. "Even if I was unreliable before, this torment is too much!"

Chen stroked his chin thoughtfully. The anomaly clearly stemmed from himself.

His gaze fell upon the demon sword in his hand, and realization dawned. Each space here was an independent prison cell—with Black Demon serving as the key.

A key still incomplete, however. Chen Xin had mentioned Black Demon needed to evolve to his second form to unlock full functionality.

"Let's go." Chen extended a hand to help Black Demon up.

The demon recoiled. "My Lord, your smile terrifies me..."

With an exasperated shake of his head, Chen grabbed him by the collar. "Stay here another decade if you prefer."

Black Demon immediately scrambled to his feet, trotting obediently behind.
###Chapter 474

Sophia Laurent stepped through the Lowell family gates with Valdemar bodyguards and police officers in tow.

Her purpose was clear—to retrieve Dr. Preston Quincy and his research team.

She strode past the chaotic living room without pause, heading straight for the staircase.

"Stop!"

Richard Lowell's dark voice exploded behind her.

Sophia didn't even turn her head, her lips curling in a mocking smile.

"Does Mr. Lowell still want to frame me for theft?"

The words landed like a slap, making everyone present blanch.

Richard's Adam's apple bobbed, but no sound emerged.

He had truly loved Emily Lowell as his own daughter.

Had even defied objections to cast her as the lead in his film.

But that vicious, cruel voice on the phone had shattered his illusions.

Victoria Lowell stepped forward with tear-streaked cheeks.

"Sophia, we wronged you..."

Her voice trembled. "Your brother fainted from anger. Your father is heartbroken..."

Sophia's gaze turned glacial.

"Mrs. Lowell, does it matter how you feel about me now?"

The address struck Victoria like lightning.

Her lips quivered. "You called me...what?"

A flicker of impatience crossed Sophia's eyes.

"Isn't this what you always wanted?"

She swept her gaze over the pale-faced Lowells. "Why pretend to care now?"

Nathan Lowell opened his mouth but found no words.

He knew better than anyone how Sophia had suffered in this house.

Every conflict had ended with her taking the blame.

The forced marriage to comatose Alexander Valdemar was merely the last straw.

What truly drove her away was twenty years of accumulated wounds.

Daniel Lowell watched his sister's unyielding back, his chest tight.

The sister he'd once looked down upon had now become someone he couldn't hope to match.
###Chapter 475

After the Starlight Design Awards concluded, Daniel Lowell pored over every single design Sophia Laurent had ever created. A tempest of emotions raged within him.

Her talent was beyond anything he could ever hope to achieve.

Only then did he realize—his internship at Versini Couture had been secured solely through Sophia's behind-the-scenes influence.

Even now, Daniel couldn't bring himself to meet her gaze.

He had no idea how to face her.

Meanwhile, Richard Lowell's face darkened with fury as he took in his wife's disheveled state. Veins bulged at his temples.

"You ungrateful wretch! Is that any way to speak to your mother?"

"Of course not. I could never measure up to your precious Emily." Sophia smoothed her skirt, lips curving slightly. "At least I don't steal other people's research."

Richard exploded.

His eyes bulged. His chest heaved. He looked moments away from collapsing.

Sophia watched coldly before turning on her heel.

Richard frowned and hurried after her.

His instincts screamed that Sophia had an agenda.

Sure enough, she headed straight for the elevator and pressed the button for the top floor.

Daniel and Nathan exchanged glances. After quickly instructing their mother to care for William, they rushed to follow.

"Stop!" Richard blocked Sophia's path. "The top floor is a restricted research area. No unauthorized personnel allowed."

Though Emily had stolen Dr. Quincy's research, as long as the scientist remained at Lowell Entertainment, there was still room for negotiation.

Sophia glanced at the security guards standing at attention and understood everything.

"Don't be absurd, Mr. Lowell." Her voice rang clear. "That floor is leased to Dr. Quincy by me. It has nothing to do with Lowell Entertainment."

Richard's face drained of color.

Seeing the armed bodyguards and police officers behind Sophia, he forced himself to remain composed.

"Sophia," he said soothingly, "we were wrong about you in the past. From now on, you'll be the only daughter of the Lowell family."

Sophia arched a brow. "And?"

"Go home and rest during your pregnancy." Richard adopted a paternal tone. "Delivering the Valdemar heir is what matters most now."

Sophia laughed. "Still dreaming, Mr. Lowell?"

Ice glinted in her eyes.

The little girl who once yearned for familial love had died in the rainstorm a decade ago.

"Don't push your luck!" Richard snarled, humiliation burning through him.

Sophia's smile vanished. "Today," she enunciated each word, "I'm taking Dr. Quincy with me."
###Chapter 476

Richard Lowell's barely contained fury flared up again.

"Sophia Laurent, must you drive us to ruin?"

Her expression remained impassive, voice glacial.

"Unlawful confinement is a crime."

She met his gaze unflinchingly.

"I won't let you harm Dr. Quincy."

At that moment, several police officers approached.

"Mr. Lowell, we've received reports of possible illegal detainment here."

Richard clenched his jaw.

Though the Lowells had connections in the capital's elite circles, they paled in comparison to the Valdemars.

These weren't ordinary officers who'd come here today.

He had no choice but to release the man now.

Refusal would mean consequences far worse than bankruptcy for Lowell Entertainment.

He forced a smile.

"A misunderstanding. Just routine questioning about a company theft."

The lead officer nodded.

"Case resolved?"

Richard shot Sophia a venomous look.

"Resolved."

She ignored his glare.

"Will you dismiss the security now?"

Rage darkened Richard's vision.

Under the officers' watchful eyes, he waved his hand.

"Stand down."

Nearly a hundred security personnel dispersed.

Sophia proceeded to the top-floor laboratory.

"Dr. Quincy, are you alright?"

Preston Quincy looked up in surprise.

"Ms. Laurent?"

She offered a warm smile.

"I came when I heard you were in trouble."

He exhaled heavily.

Without her timely intervention, they'd never have left this building.

"We're fine."

Sophia lowered her voice.

"I've established a new research facility in the western suburbs. Would you consider relocating?"

His eyes brightened.

"Absolutely."

His research served humanity, not personal gain.

Adequate funding and facilities were all he required.

Sophia relaxed.

"I'll arrange the transfer immediately."

Dr. Quincy nodded gratefully.

"My thanks."

Nearby, Richard listened with mounting desperation.
###Chapter 477

"Dr. Quincy, please wait."

Richard Lowell hurried forward, blocking Dr. Preston Quincy's path.

"The resources the Lowell Group can provide are twice what Sophia Laurent offers."

His gaze bore into the internationally renowned research expert.

Dr. Quincy paused, adjusting his glasses.

His eyes behind the lenses remained calm as still water.

"Mr. Lowell, when my lab was on the verge of collapse, it was Miss Laurent who extended a helping hand."

His voice was firm.

"I will never forget that kindness."

With that, he led his team out of the conference room with Sophia.

Richard's face twisted. His vision darkened as he collapsed backward.

"Dad!"

Daniel and Nathan Lowell rushed to catch him.

Chaos erupted throughout the Lowell Group headquarters.

The Cunningham estate glowed with warm light.

Ryan Cunningham hosted an intimate dinner party for Emily Lowell.

"Ryan, is this the legendary Miss Lowell I've heard so much about?"

A young socialite raised his champagne flute.

"An absolute vision!"

Emily smiled demurely, cheeks flushing pink.

"You flatter me."

Her eyes discreetly scanned the elite guests—people she'd once considered untouchable.

"Ryan's a lucky man!"

Another heir nudged his friend with a grin.

"I heard you secured Dr. Quincy's project?"

The room fell silent, ears perking up.

Ryan swirled his wine glass, lips curving.

"I have Emily to thank for that."

He pulled her close, arm draped over her shoulders.

"Consider it my fiancée's dowry."

Gasps and murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Miss Lowell is incredible!"

"Ryan hit the jackpot!"

Praise poured in from all sides.

Emily lowered her head to hide her triumphant smile.

"But..."

Someone voiced the lingering question.

"Isn't the Lowell Group holding a press conference? How did the project end up with Ryan?"
###Chapter 478

Ryan Cunningham swirled his wine glass with a faint smirk playing on his lips.

"This press conference is doomed to fail."

The room fell into an uneasy silence as guests exchanged knowing glances.

The business world was a battlefield of hidden daggers and open confrontations. Every guest here was a seasoned opportunist.

They secretly cursed their missed chance to acquire Dr. Quincy's research before the Cunninghams.

Now they could only watch helplessly as the Cunninghams claimed the prize.

If they could hitch their wagons to this powerful family, even scraps from the table would suffice.

No one mentioned the press conference again.

"Ryan, a toast to the Cunninghams' brilliant acquisition."

"Don't forget about us when new opportunities arise. The Shaws will always support you."

"Me too! Ryan, let me propose another toast!"

Amidst the flurry of compliments, Ryan's vanity swelled.

His younger brother had always been the golden child - excelling in academics and business strategy.

Though Ryan held the CEO title, real power belonged to his vice president brother.

He wasn't jealous. Just... occasionally overlooked.

Securing Dr. Quincy's research finally earned their father's approval.

That rare look of pride tasted sweeter than the finest wine.

Ryan raised his glass gracefully. "Your kindness humbles me."

Meanwhile, Emily Lowell recalled her earlier confrontation with William with satisfaction.

If the Lowells truly considered her family, they would have handed over the research willingly.

Only then could she enter the Cunningham marriage with dignity.

But William had stubbornly refused her repeated hints.

She'd been forced to take matters into her own hands, helping Ryan's men steal the research.

Emily felt no remorse.

After years of pretending to treat her as their own, wasn't this the least the Lowells owed her?

That old fox Richard only wanted to use her to climb into the Cunninghams' good graces.

Did he ever consider her position in their household?

As guests took turns toasting the couple, Emily excused herself when the wine made her head swim.

Ryan gently released his grip on her waist. "Don't be long."

Her lilac chiffon dress and delicate makeup made her resemble a fragile violet.

Alcohol painted her cheeks pink and clouded her vision.

Unfamiliar with the Cunningham mansion, she wandered into a secluded corner.

On a nearby balcony stood a tall figure in black formalwear.

Moonlight accentuated his sharp profile and imposing presence.

Emily held her breath as she approached.

A deep voice carried through the night:

"Accelerate the decryption..."

Before she could react, the man turned abruptly.

Their eyes met.

Emily's blood turned to ice.

Those hawk-like eyes pinned her in place.

All traces of intoxication vanished instantly.
###Chapter 479

The man before her was all too familiar—Ryan Cunningham Jr., younger brother of Ryan Cunningham.

They'd never had much interaction.

Recognizing Emily Lowell, the sharp edges of his presence instantly smoothed into an eerie stillness.

"Why are you here?"

The accusatory tone ignited her temper.

She was the future matriarch of the Cunningham family, Ryan's lawfully wedded wife.

How dare a mere second son address her like this?

When she remained silent, he turned to leave without a second thought.

"Stop."

He glanced back, one brow arched.

That condescending look made her nails bite into her palms.

"What's with that attitude?"

She emphasized pointedly, "Don't forget who brought Dr. Quincy's research to the table."

His eyes flickered before he disappeared down the corridor.

Emily stamped her foot in frustration.

An heirless nobody daring to slight her?

Only Sophia Laurent had ever treated her this way.

Returning to the gala, she deliberately reddened her eyes before Ryan.

"What's wrong?" he asked absently.

"Nothing." She lowered her head in feigned distress.

Ryan smirked inwardly.

The woman's acting skills were first-rate.

But with Dr. Quincy's research data still up for grabs, he played along. "Emily, tell me what happened."

She sniffled. "I...ran into your brother earlier..."

Ryan's brow lifted.

Of course Ryan Jr. wouldn't give her the time of day.

"What did he do?"
###Chapter 480

Ryan Cunningham knew his brother's temperament well enough to predict he'd likely ignore Emily.

Emily Lowell met his probing gaze and lightly bit her lower lip.

Had it been any of the Lowell men seeing her like this, they would've erupted in fury and gone seeking vengeance.

But Ryan remained unmoved.

She had no choice but to swallow her feigned grievance.

"Really, it was nothing. Just a coincidence."

"I see."

Ryan gave her a meaningful glance. "Tired? There's a guest room upstairs."

He certainly wouldn't confront Ryan Jr. on Emily's behalf.

Emily's eyes darkened at his hollow concern. "Alright."

Her earlier distress had been an act.

This current disappointment, however, was genuine.

After bidding farewell to the others, she ascended the stairs.

Ryan watched her leave before heading straight to Ryan Jr.'s study.

The lively clamor of the party downstairs was replaced by the rhythmic tapping of keyboard keys.

"How's the research institute progressing?"

Ryan Jr. looked up from his monitor, brow slightly furrowed. "Data simulation needs at least another week."

"Speed it up."

Despite obtaining Dr. Quincy's research, uncertainty lingered until full mastery was achieved.

"Already working overtime."

Ryan nodded, as if reassuring himself. "I personally escorted Quentin and Emily to the office that day. The data should be secure."

At Emily's name, Ryan Jr.'s frown deepened momentarily before relaxing. "Mhm."

Noticing the reaction, Ryan arched an eyebrow. "Ran into Emily just now? What happened?"

"Nothing."

"Really?" Ryan blinked. "Then why did she look so wronged?"

Ryan Jr. remained silent for several beats before stating flatly, "Dramatic delusions of grandeur."

Ryan burst out laughing. "Accurate assessment."

Clearly done with the topic, Ryan Jr. picked up his pen again.

Surveying the mountain of documents, Ryan shrugged. "I'll leave you to it."

As he turned to go, his brother's voice stopped him.

"Was it worth it?"

"What?"

After a beat of confusion, Ryan realized he meant the arranged marriage with Emily for the research.

He chuckled dismissively. "Had to get married eventually, right?"

Ryan Jr. had uncovered Dr. Quincy's whereabouts.

But buried in work, he had no patience for Emily's theatrics.

And alternative methods to recruit the doctor were impossible.
###Chapter 481 Marriage Is Just a Transaction

Ryan Cunningham Jr. tapped his wine glass with slender fingers, his gaze fixed on his brother's carefree expression.

"Are you really going to marry Emily Lowell?"

Ryan swirled his glass, the amber liquid tracing an elegant arc.

"Just for fun."

A smirk played on his lips, his eyes aloof.

"Women are nothing but distractions."

Ryan Jr. frowned slightly, but his brother continued, "Marriage changes nothing for me. It's a transaction—mutually beneficial."

"I'll entertain her when I feel like it. Otherwise, I won't even bother seeing her."

He drained his glass in one gulp, the crystal catching a cold glint under the light.

"To me, marriage is just decoration."

He set the glass down carelessly, the clink sharp against the silence.

"If it brings benefits, why not?"

Ryan Jr. studied his brother's expression, confirming his indifference before nodding.

"As long as you know what you're doing."

That Emily Lowell was unbearable.

But if Ryan didn’t care, neither would he.

At the Lowell Group press conference, reporters shifted impatiently in the media section.

"It's already eleven. Why hasn't it started?"

"Where are Mr. Lowell and Dr. Quincy?"

"Are they playing us?"

Whispers rippled through the crowd.

Backstage, Secretary Shaw wiped sweat from his brow, his palms clammy as he repeatedly dialed the company line.

"Hello?"

A timid voice finally answered.

"Mr. Lowell... fainted. He's at the hospital now."

Secretary Shaw's pupils constricted.

"What happened?"

"I... I don't know the details..."

The intern stammered.

"Both Mr. Lowell and the chairman are hospitalized. The press conference..."

She swallowed hard.

"The secretariat said... you should handle it."

Secretary Shaw nearly dropped the phone.

"Me?"

His voice cracked.

A secretary facing a room full of journalists and experts?

But there was no other choice.

When he stepped onto the stage, the room fell silent.

Dozens of expectant eyes locked onto him.

His grip on the microphone trembled slightly.

"Ladies and gentlemen, we sincerely apologize..."

He took a deep breath.

"Due to unforeseen circumstances, today's press conference will be postponed—"

Before he could finish, the room erupted.
###Chapter 482

Quentin Shaw's announcement sent waves through the conference hall.

Reporters immediately raised their microphones, clamoring for answers.

"Is Lowell Entertainment playing games with us? The press conference was scheduled a week ago!"

"What about the medical experts who flew in from overseas?"

"Dr. Quincy's research has global attention. How do you explain this last-minute cancellation?"

Beads of sweat formed on Quentin's forehead as his fingers tightened around the speech draft.

"My sincere apologies. Dr. Quincy suddenly fell ill and cannot attend today's event."

He forced himself to maintain the fabricated excuse.

The murmurs in the hall gradually subsided.

"How serious is Dr. Quincy's condition? What's the recovery timeline?"

"We international experts adjusted our schedules specifically for this. At least give us a definite date."

"That's right. We can wait, but we need a clear answer."

Quentin's dress shirt clung to his damp back.

"We're awaiting the doctor's diagnosis. Lowell Entertainment will provide updates as soon as possible."

His earnest demeanor somewhat placated the crowd.

"We'll await your notification then."

Quentin exhaled deeply as the attendees dispersed.

The immediate crisis had been averted.

He hurried toward the parking lot, needing to return to headquarters immediately.

This was far from over.

Online platforms had already exploded.

#DrQuincyMedicalRobot trended at the top of search rankings.

Netizens had been refreshing live stream pages since morning.

"What? The press conference got canceled?"

"What happened to Dr. Quincy? Will this affect the research?"

"I took time off work just for this live stream!"

"Don't panic. It's postponed, not canceled."

Meanwhile, Dr. Preston Quincy was leading his team toward the outskirts.

Sophia Laurent had established a high-security research facility there.

When the gleaming white complex came into view, Quincy smiled with relief.

"Ms. Laurent, I can't thank you enough."
###Chapter 483

Years ago, he was destitute and couldn't even afford the rent for his research lab. It was Sophia Laurent who extended a helping hand, giving him a chance at rebirth.

Over the years, he had only released two basic medical robots.

Though they caused a sensation in the industry, the profits were far from enough to cover the institute's massive expenses.

Now, he had finally turned his dream into reality.

Sophia's lips curved slightly. "It was the least I could do."

Her relaxed brows and radiant smile made people unconsciously ease up.

"My investment in you wasn't without ulterior motives."

Her blunt words actually reassured Dr. Quincy.

The most unsettling thing in this world was charity without any expectations.

Dr. Quincy said solemnly, "Ms. Laurent, I didn't let you down."

Suddenly remembering something, his expression turned serious. "That day at the restaurant, you warned me to be wary of Emily Lowell. Today, she really came to steal data. How did you predict it?"

That day, he received a call from his assistant, saying William Lowell had brought Emily to tour the institute.

Sophia immediately instructed him to transfer the core data.

What Emily stole was nothing but carefully fabricated false information.

Sophia chuckled lightly. "Just a woman's intuition."

Dr. Quincy had been with the Lowell Group for years, yet Emily had never visited before.

Her sudden appearance right before the product launch was undeniably suspicious.

Unlike William, Sophia wasn't the type to trust Emily unconditionally.

Moreover, Emily's scandal with Ryan Cunningham had emerged under peculiar circumstances.

What raised Sophia's suspicions the most was Emily's opportunistic nature—she never acted without personal gain.

Someone must have set their sights on Dr. Quincy's research.

But she hadn't expected Emily to hand the data directly to Ryan, deliberately humiliating the Lowell Group at the press conference.

As the two conversed, an assistant hurried over.

"Doctor, the Lowell Group is blaming you for canceling the press conference, claiming you fell suddenly ill. Should we respond?"

Dr. Quincy frowned and looked at Sophia.

After a brief pause, Sophia asked, "Dr. Quincy, would you be interested in joining Pearl Group?"
###Chapter 484

Dr. Quincy met Sophia's gaze without hesitation.

"Of course."

All these years, he'd never signed any formal agreement with her. Yet in his heart, he'd long been committed.

A faint smile touched Sophia's lips.

"Three days later. Hold another press conference under Pearl Group's name."

Those medical luminaries had come for Dr. Quincy. She wouldn't let them down.

As for Lowell Entertainment? Not her concern.

Dr. Quincy responded crisply. "Your call."

In the hospital room, William and Richard Lowell regained consciousness.

"No physical complications. The fainting spells were stress-induced."

William's face remained stormy.

Richard ground his teeth. "Find Emily."

He still couldn't believe their adopted daughter would betray the family.

"I want to hear it from her—how exactly has this family failed her?"

They'd given her silks and satins, elite education, pampered her like royalty.

When Alexander Valdemar was at his peak, they'd never considered switching the arranged marriage.

In their eyes, Emily deserved only the best.

And how had she repaid them?

By stealing the family's most vital research. By pushing Lowell Entertainment toward ruin.

Such ingratitude was unimaginable.

William, Daniel, and Nathan all silently agreed.

They too wanted answers.

Emily's betrayal cut deeper than Sophia's departure.

Only Victoria defended her.

"Emily must have her reasons. She's still young and impulsive. Let's just get the research back."

The daughter they'd raised from childhood held her favor.

This sweet, innocent girl must have been cornered somehow.

William and Daniel didn't argue.

Nathan exploded.

"Mom, she's in her twenties! Sophia was handling corporate crises at her age."

At Sophia's name, the room fell silent.

Nathan's control shattered completely.

"Emily's no innocent. She's vicious. She orchestrated bullying campaigns to drive Sophia out of school."

Victoria gasped. "Impossible!"

"Oh?" Nathan sneered. "The private investigator's report says otherwise."

He pulled out his phone, presenting the damning evidence.

The color drained from every face in the room.

Daniel frowned. "Why didn't you tell us sooner?"

Nathan laughed bitterly. "Would you have believed me before the theft?"

Deathly silence engulfed the hospital room.
###Chapter 485

The pain isn't real until it cuts your own flesh.

Emily Lowell's misdeeds had always been willfully ignored by the Lowell family—as long as they weren't the ones suffering.

Even with evidence staring them in the face, they'd chosen self-deception.

Because the blade never touched their skin.

Now, the Lowells finally tasted the agony Sophia Laurent had endured.

That betrayal by blood felt like a dull knife slowly carving into their hearts.

"Did you find her?" Richard Lowell's voice was gravel.

His secretary handed over a file. "Mr. Lowell, Miss Emily is at the Cunningham estate."

A fleet of luxury cars sped toward the Cunningham villa.

The mansion blazed with lights, alive with clinking glasses and laughter.

The butler ushered them in respectfully upon recognizing the Lowell entourage.

"Young Master Cunningham, the Lowell family is here."

The ballroom fell silent.

Guests exchanged knowing glances.

Some discreetly raised their phones.

Ryan Cunningham's smile froze momentarily.

"Uncle, Aunt, what brings you here so—"

"Tell Emily Lowell to get out here now!" Richard's voice could have iced hell.

A flicker of understanding passed through Ryan's eyes.

He'd anticipated this day would come.

"One moment, please."

As he turned, a mocking smirk played on his lips.

Richard watched his retreating figure, knuckles cracking under the strain.

This man he'd once praised as a perfect son-in-law now grated on his nerves.

Upstairs in the master bedroom.

Emily stood before a mirror, fastening a new diamond necklace.

"Ryan promised me an even bigger one once the research goes into production—"

The doorbell chimed.

"Madam, your family is here."
###Chapter 486

Emily Lowell's drunken haze vanished instantly.

She stared at the servant delivering the message, brows furrowing slightly. Shouldn't the Lowells be dealing with the press conference fallout? Why would they come looking for her now?

Her fingernails dug unconsciously into her palms. She took a deep breath. There was no avoiding this confrontation.

Adjusting her shawl, Emily descended the staircase with practiced grace.

Curious glances followed her from the mingling guests in the grand hall. She forced a perfect smile toward the Lowells standing at the center.

"Father, Mother, brothers... what brings you here so suddenly?"

"How dare you ask?" Richard Lowell's face darkened, his voice low but razor-sharp.

Emily's smile froze. The surrounding stares prickled her skin like needles.

"Father, this isn't the place." She softened her tone. "Shall we speak in the parlor?"

Richard's chest heaved with suppressed rage. He knew better than to air dirty laundry in public. With a cold snort, he turned on his heel.

As Nathan moved to follow, Emily caught his sleeve lightly.

"Not you, Nathan." Her eyes glistened faintly. "This is family business."

Nathan nodded agreeably, relief flashing in his gaze.

The moment the Lowells departed, whispers rippled through the ballroom.

"Aren't you going after them, Mr. Cunningham?" someone prodded.

Ryan Cunningham swirled his champagne glass with detached amusement. "Family matters require discretion."

"Here to reclaim the research data, perhaps?" another voice interjected.

Ryan merely smiled, tracing the rim of his glass. What's swallowed is never spit out.

The parlor door had barely closed when Richard slammed his palm against the table.

"You stole Dr. Quincy's core data for the Cunninghams!"

Emily recoiled half a step. Of course she knew its value—why else would Ryan covet it so desperately?

"The Cunningham project needed those findings..." Her voice dwindled to a murmur.
###Chapter 487

Richard Lowell's eyes were bloodshot as he glared at Emily Lowell.

"How dare you claim it was necessary? After all the scandals with 'River Banquet,' didn't I turn a blind eye each time?"

His voice trembled. "Even when the box office flopped, I never reprimanded you!"

Emily curled her lips into a cold smile.

It was true Richard had never scolded her.

But she knew better than anyone—it was only because of her engagement to the Cunningham family.

Without that arranged marriage, she'd be nothing in Richard's eyes.

Hadn't Sophia Laurent been forced into that therapeutic marriage with comatose Alexander Valdemar when her value diminished?

"Father, the Cunningham alliance was inevitable anyway. What does it matter if they get the research?"

She spoke casually. "Dr. Quincy's team still works for Lowell Entertainment, don't they?"

Emily lifted her chin. "You always said I was like your real daughter. Shouldn't I receive gifts for my wedding?"

Richard shook with rage.

In just two months, the Lowell empire had begun crumbling.

Dr. Quincy's medical robotics project was their last hope.

Now Emily had handed it over like a party favor.

Slap!

The sharp crack of a palm striking flesh echoed through the room.

Emily clutched her stinging cheek, eyes wide with shock.

No one had ever dared strike her before.

"So this is how you treat me over some stupid research?"

Her voice turned shrill. "All that talk about being your real daughter—what a joke!"

A sudden laugh burst from her lips.

"Hah... Only that idiot Sophia would be foolish enough to care about you people—"

The room plunged into silence.

"Shut your mouth!"

Nathan Lowell's eyes burned crimson. "I know what you did to Sophia all those years ago!"

His knuckles turned white. "Such cruelty at such a young age—you're just like your butcher parents."

Emily's expression froze momentarily.

Then she recovered with practiced ease.

"Who are you to play the saint now?"

Her mocking tone cut deep. "Who locked Sophia in her room without food? Who left her outside in winter? Who set the dogs on her? Who beat her?"

Nathan paled.

His fists clenched until the bones threatened to break through skin.

"If you hadn't deceived me, I would never—"

His voice cracked. "This is all your doing!"

Emily smirked.

"What can you possibly do about it now?"

She tilted her chin higher. "I'm Mrs. Cunningham now—future matriarch of the Cunningham empire."

"You'd better think carefully about how to address me from now on."
###Chapter 488

Emily Lowell's true nature plunged the entire Lowell family into despair.

William Lowell entered the room in silence.

He had given Emily the most—his devotion, his affection, his unwavering trust.

Now, betrayed by the one closest to him, his heart lay in ruins.

Her arrogant tone sent chills down his spine.

His eyes dimmed with profound disappointment.

"Emily," he rasped, "you stole Dr. Quincy's research just to please the Cunninghams?"

She nodded without hesitation. "I'm marrying into their family. Of course I'd prioritize them."

William burst into hysterical laughter.

The sound was laced with bitterness and sorrow.

"Sophia was right. You're both wicked and foolish."

But his realization had come too late.

Emily frowned. "What do you mean, William? Shouldn't I look out for myself?"

"Look out for yourself?" His eyes burned with fury. "You're destroying the Lowells!"

His voice roared through the room. "When this family falls, what future will you have? Did you think you were Sophia Laurent?"

At last, he saw the truth.

Sophia was undeniably exceptional.

Losing her had been their greatest mistake.

But Emily? She only schemed. What had she ever achieved?

Emily's expression darkened.

"Sophia is nothing! Just a healing marriage prop. The Valdemars will discard her soon enough."

Her voice dripped with venom.

With the stolen research data and Ryan Cunningham's favor, how could Sophia possibly compare?

Her hatred for Sophia was undisguised.

Victoria Lowell gasped. "Emily! How can you speak of your sister like that?"

"Sister?" Emily sneered. "She's unworthy. We're mortal enemies—can't you see that?"

Sophia's mere existence tormented her.

Why was Sophia the true heiress while she was just a butcher's daughter?

She would crush Sophia beneath her heel.

That was her real motive for helping the Cunninghams.

Victoria stood speechless, stunned by her words.

Daniel Lowell regained his composure. "Sophia founded Pearl Group. She's Versini Couture's lead designer, a prodigious composer, and Gavin Croix's collaborator. What do you have?"

With each accomplishment listed, Emily's face twisted further.

"Shut up!" she snapped violently.
###Chapter 489

Emily Lowell's face turned ashen, her fingers digging into the armrest of the sofa.

"This is the Cunningham estate. Do you really think I won't have security throw you out?"

Nathan Lowell's gaze sliced through her like a blade.

"Karma always comes around, Emily. You'll get what you deserve."

"Why waste words on her?" Richard Lowell slammed his palm on the table.

"I'll ask you one last time—are you returning Dr. Quincy's research data or not?"

Emily let out a mocking laugh, her red lips curling.

"Not a chance."

Victoria Lowell finally snapped out of her daze and lunged forward, grabbing Emily's collar.

"You ungrateful wretch! The Lowells raised you for over twenty years, and this is how you repay us?"

"Get off me!" Emily shoved her hard, sending Victoria stumbling back onto the sofa.

She smoothed her collar with deliberate slowness, her eyes filled with disdain.

"If you truly saw me as family, you would've told the Cunninghams these assets were meant to be my dowry. What would it have cost you to let me marry in glory?"

The room went deathly silent.

"This isn't up for debate." Emily lifted her chin.

"Once I'm Mrs. Cunningham, I'll naturally pull the Lowells up with me. Compared to that useless Sophia, I'm being more than generous."

William Lowell felt bile rise in his throat. He stared at the sister he'd doted on since childhood, his voice icy.

"Emily, don't say we didn't warn you."

"Regret?" Emily burst into shrill laughter.

"Every socialite in the capital envies me for marrying into the Cunninghams!"

"You vile creature!" Richard hurled a vase at the wall, sending porcelain shards flying.

"Trash will always be trash. That butcher's blood runs thick in you!"

He demolished every decorative piece in the parlor before pointing a trembling finger at Emily.

"Rot in prison like your birth parents!"

Nathan steadied his father, his eyes sharp as daggers.

"Stealing corporate secrets and causing billions in losses? That's at least a decade behind bars."

The words hit Emily like a bucket of ice water.

"Have you all lost your minds?" Her voice shook.

"My marriage to the Cunninghams benefits the Lowells!"

The family responded with bitter laughter.

"Would the Cunninghams marry a felon?"

"By the time you're out, Ryan Cunningham will have moved on."

"Using the Lowells as your stepping stone? Dream on."

Emily staggered back, her nails drawing blood from her palms.

For the first time, she realized these people who'd once indulged her every whim were now dead set on destroying her.
###Chapter 490

Richard Lowell stared at Emily Lowell's contorted face, feeling the suffocating anger in his chest dissipate slightly.

A mocking smirk curled at the corners of his lips.

"Emily Lowell, do you really think we'd believe your lies now?"

He turned to leave without another word.

There was no point wasting more time if they couldn't retrieve the research data.

With the evidence in hand, the Cunningham family wouldn't profit easily from stolen research.

He had barely taken a step when Emily blocked his path.

Facing the furious gazes of the Lowell family, she remained eerily composed.

This was the Cunningham estate—her territory.

"Stay right there."

Her voice dripped with condescension.

"If you know what's good for you, groveling to the Cunninghams now might still earn you some scraps."

Her eyes narrowed, tone turning icy.

"Otherwise..."

"You'll find yourselves unwelcome in the capital."

A washed-up director.

A mediocre designer.

A has-been singer.

And an imprisoned actor.

These worthless people dared threaten her?

The disdain in Emily's eyes was unmistakable.

The Lowells watched their once-beloved adoptive daughter's haughty demeanor with hearts bleeding.

At that moment, they all thought of Sophia Laurent.

Her hopeful eyes when she first returned home.

Her quiet sacrifices for the family.

The headache medicine for their mother.

The project files for their father and brothers.

She had yearned so desperately for their affection.

Yet they denied her even the smallest warmth.

Forcing her into a therapeutic marriage with Alexander Valdemar in his comatose state.

Perhaps that was when her heart turned to ice.

Regret crashed over them like tidal waves.

If only they had sent Emily away...

If only they had treated Sophia better...

The Lowell empire wouldn't be crumbling.

Their research wouldn't have been stolen.

Their hatred for Emily burned fiercer.

"Scared?" Richard's voice was glacial. "This isn't over."

He strode past her with his family, not sparing her a single glance.

Emily faltered, rushing after them in panic.

Just as they reached the antechamber, Ryan Cunningham appeared with a polished smile.

"Uncle, Aunt, you rarely visit. Why not stay and meet some friends?"

His mind raced—if the Lowells pursued this, complications would arise.

Best to convince them to drop the matter entirely.
###Chapter 491

Richard Lowell's cold gaze swept over Ryan Cunningham's insincere smile as he spoke without courtesy.

"Ryan Cunningham. You have three days to return Dr. Quincy's research data. Otherwise, the Lowell family won't let this go."

He delivered the ultimatum and turned to leave.

William Lowell cast a glance at Emily Lowell before departing, his lips curling in derision.

"Emily Lowell. This shortcut you've chosen will become your dead end."

Emily bristled instantly, clutching Ryan's arm possessively.

"William, stop trying to drive a wedge between us! Ryan and I are truly in love. He's ten times better than you hypocritical so-called family!"

Her eyes flashed with venom.

The Lowells simply couldn't bear to see her happy, always sabotaging her life.

William found her reaction laughable.

Twenty years of the family's devotion had nurtured this ungrateful viper.

"Suit yourself."

He tossed the words coldly over his shoulder, following his father out.

Emily glared at their retreating figures, nails digging into her palms.

She'd show the Lowells. She'd rise to greatness through the Cunninghams.

"Ryan, do you think they'll retaliate?"

She looked up at him with feigned vulnerability.

Irritation flickered in Ryan's eyes before being replaced by tenderness.

"Don't worry. The Lowells are paper tigers now."

He stroked her hair soothingly while calculating how to counter the Lowell family's moves.

Emily melted into his embrace.

"I knew you'd protect me."

She missed the fleeting disgust in Ryan's expression.

Suddenly, Pearl Group's official account dropped two bombshell announcements.

The first announced Dr. Preston Quincy's team officially joining the company.

The second revealed Sophia Laurent would personally host Dr. Quincy's research presentation in three days.

The internet exploded.

Netizens were still reeling from Lowell Entertainment's scandal when this seismic news struck.
###Chapter 492

Pearl Entertainment's announcement exploded like a bomb in the business world.

Sophia Laurent's nails dug deep into her palms.

She stared at the announcement on her phone screen, venom practically dripping from her eyes.

"This can't be..."

Her whisper trembled with disbelief.

Ryan Cunningham stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, his expression dark as storm clouds.

"What game is the Lowell family playing?"

He turned sharply, his suit jacket flaring with the movement.

Emily Lowell looked up, panic flashing across her face.

"Ryan, I swear I didn't know—"

Her words died in her throat.

Ryan's piercing gaze made her skin crawl.

Online discussions erupted into chaos.

#DrQuincyDefection trended instantly.

"Sophia's burning all bridges with the Lowells!"

"Rich family drama beats any soap opera!"

At Valdemar Holdings headquarters...

Alexander Valdemar stood before the panoramic windows, surveying the city below.

His long fingers tapped rhythmically against the glass.

"Confirmed?"

His assistant wiped sweat from his brow.

"Dr. Quincy is indeed at Pearl Entertainment..."

Alexander's eyes turned glacial.

"Keep digging."

He grabbed his suit jacket and strode toward the elevator.

At the Lowell mansion...

Richard Lowell smashed a teacup against the floor.

"Outrageous!"

Victoria Lowell sat pale-faced on the sofa.

"How could Sophia do this..."

Her voice cracked with emotion.

Pearl Entertainment headquarters...

Sophia stood at the center of the conference room, lips curved in triumph.

"Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for victory."

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floor.

Dr. Quincy adjusted his glasses, watching her uneasily.

"Ms. Laurent, are you certain about this?"

Sophia turned, her skirt swirling gracefully.

"Everything's under control."

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

"Alexander Valdemar" flashed on the screen.

Sophia chuckled and declined the call.

At Valdemar Holdings...

Alexander stared at the disconnected call, his gaze deepening.

"Interesting."

His fingers drummed against the desk.

The assistant burst in breathlessly.

"Sir, Dr. Quincy's family was secretly relocated last night."

Alexander's eyes sharpened.

"As I suspected."

He rose abruptly, his jacket whipping with the motion.

"Get the car. We're going to Pearl Entertainment."

Meanwhile...

Emily glared at her phone screen.

Her nails screeched across the glass.

"Sophia..."

She spat the name through clenched teeth.

Ryan placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Patience. We still have moves left."

His eyes darkened.

Emily looked up, malice glinting in her gaze.

"I'll make her pay."

Her voice could freeze hell.

Outside Pearl Entertainment...

Alexander's car screeched to a halt at the entrance.

As he stepped out, Sophia stood waiting on the steps.

Their eyes locked.

Electric tension crackled between them.

Sophia's crimson lips curved.

"Mr. Valdemar. What a pleasant surprise."
###Chapter 493

The black Lincoln limousine was suffocating with tension. The Lowell family stared at Pearl Group's announcement on their phone screens.

Richard Lowell tapped twice on the leather seat before letting out a cold chuckle.

"That girl moves fast."

His eyes narrowed, recalling Sophia's sharp phoenix eyes. The Lowell genes were decent, but Sophia had inherited exceptional beauty and business acumen.

William Lowell gazed blankly out the window, indifferent to the announcement. His mind still replayed Emily's betrayal.

Daniel Lowell silently scrolled through Versini Couture's financial report, his fingertips turning cold. Only now did he realize he'd never truly understood his sister.

"The internet is tearing Lowell Entertainment apart," Nathan Lowell suddenly raised his phone. "They're saying our silence proves guilt."

His eyes swept across the family. "Should we clarify for Sophia?"

Silence filled the car again.

William finally spoke. "She doesn't need it."

With Dr. Quincy on her side, that was proof enough.

Richard slammed his hand on the armrest. "Call the police! Now!" His voice dripped with venom. "Emily thinks she can trample the Lowells to marry into the Cunninghams? Dream on!"

"I'll arrange it." Nathan immediately dialed his assistant.

Meanwhile, Pearl Group's new laboratory blazed with light.

Sophia had just finished calibrating equipment with Dr. Quincy when her phone vibrated.

"Yes?" Her voice softened instinctively.

Alexander's deep tone came through the receiver. "Grandfather wants to know if you'll join us for dinner."

A pause. "Just family."

His pen twirled between fingers.

Sophia laughed lightly. "Of course."

As she hung up, police sirens wailed in the distance. Through the window, she watched Emily being escorted into a patrol car.
###Chapter 494

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting golden patterns across the office. Sophia Laurent stood by the window, her fingers absently tracing the edge of her phone.

Alexander Valdemar's call came at the perfect moment.

She cherished those dinners with Patriarch Valdemar. The warmth of genuine familial affection was something she'd never experienced in her twenty-odd years with the Lowells.

"I'll pick you up soon."

His voice resonated through the phone, deep and gentle with an undercurrent of tenderness she'd come to recognize.

A smile tugged at Sophia's lips as she ended the call. This flutter of anticipation was foreign to her Lowell days.

Her assistant entered with a troubled expression.

"Ms. Laurent, the online backlash against Pearl Group is intensifying."

Sophia took the tablet. The screen overflowed with scathing comments.

"She's determined to destroy the Lowells!"

"Even Emily Lowell wouldn't stoop this low against her own family."

"Capitalists will do anything for profit."

Her fingers glided over the screen with detached calm.

"Ignore them. Wait for the press conference in three days."

She knew the Lowells too well. Dr. Quincy's departure had severed their last lifeline.

"Monitor the Lowells and Emily."

The assistant soon returned with updates: The Lowells had fled to Ryan Cunningham's villa, while Emily had been taken into police custody.

A humorless laugh escaped Sophia's lips, her eyes flashing with irony.

She'd given everything to the Lowells, only to receive betrayal in return. Now they were tasting the bitterness they'd sown.

"Release the news."

Turning back to the window, she watched the sunset paint the sky in fiery hues.

A new beginning beckoned.
###Chapter 495

If the black-clad figures knew Liu Wuxie had fled into the Shadowwoods, they'd be seething with rage.

The Shadowwoods were a forbidden realm across three worlds, where neither demon nor mortal dared tread.

No one could have predicted Liu Wuxie would choose this path of no return.

"We enter at dawn." Liu Wuxie paused at the forest's edge, addressing Bai Ling.

She nodded. Her mother's memories told her the Shadowwoods were marginally safer by daylight.

Both seized these final moments to recuperate.

Liu Wuxie sat cross-legged, his consciousness sinking into the Devouring Divine Cauldron.

The Yin-Yang Stele floated within.

Throughout their journey, he'd been tempering the artifact with demonic flames.

The searing process had made its dualistic patterns increasingly distinct.

"Guard me."

Before Bai Ling could respond, he vanished into the cauldron.

The stele's intricate carvings stole his breath. Their profundity dwarfed his understanding of the Grand Yin-Yang Art by a thousandfold.

Bai Ling maintained vigilant watch.

"Mastering this artifact with the Grand Yin-Yang Art would make me invincible."

Madness flickered in Liu Wuxie's eyes.

Hands weaving seals, he channeled streams of yin-yang laws into the stele.

Time flowed slower within the cauldron—six hours inside equaling sixty without.

With this artifact in the perilous Shadowwoods, he'd gain unstoppable power.

"It resists penetration?"

Despite prolonged effort, the stele's core remained impenetrable.

"Truly a treasure of heaven and earth."

Rather than frustration, exhilaration surged through him.

"Heavenly Dao Tome, assist me!"

Golden light erupted as the sacred text materialized above the stele.

Under its celestial pressure, the artifact's resistance waned.

This unclaimed relic would only answer to masters of the Grand Yin-Yang Art.

Liu Wuxie sought not ownership, but communion.

As energy continued flowing, a subtle resonance formed—not the bond of a blood-bound artifact, but a covenant with the cosmos.

Night deepened.

Eerie luminescent specks drifted above the Shadowwoods like shattered constellations.

Bestial howls echoed through the trees, raising hairs on necks.

Bai Ling tensed. Never before had she faced such danger alone.

A rustling came from the forest's edge.

Leaping onto a branch, she glimpsed hundreds of demonkin shuffling forward under faint light.

"Why would demons come here?"

Alarm bells rang in her mind.

Human cultivators soon appeared from other directions.

Transforming into her nine-tailed fox form, Bai Ling melted into the canopy.

"Ever heard of the Shadowwoods?" someone whispered below.

"A forbidden zone of the mortal realm," answered an immortal lord.

"With demons massing here, something's amiss."

"The Oracle Guild prophesied a supreme treasure's emergence."

"The Oracle Guild? Weren't they extinct?"

"Now they serve the Celestial Sovereign Alliance..."

The voices faded.

Bai Ling dropped down, brow furrowed.

If true, finding her mother's celestial soul would become far harder.

Dawn approached.

Within the cauldron, Liu Wuxie's eyes snapped open.

"Rise!"

The Yin-Yang Stele obeyed, its terrifying aura shaking the divine vessel.

"Such devastating power."

Liu Wuxie marveled. This artifact could suppress realms and slaughter enemies alike.

"With this, even immortal kings could fall."

At his thought, the stele settled beside the Heavenly God Stele in his Primordial World.

Nourished by primordial energies, their connection strengthened.

"Visitors last night?"

Emerging, Liu Wuxie noticed countless footprints.

Bai Ling recounted her observations.

"The Oracle Guild..." Liu Wuxie's pupils contracted. "The Celestial Sovereign Alliance too?"

This spelled trouble.

"Shall we proceed?" Bai Ling asked.

Unconsciously, she'd grown reliant on Liu Wuxie.

"Forward!"

His decision was instant.

Following earlier tracks, they ventured deeper.

Daylight revealed the Shadowwoods' gnarled trees and tangled vines.

A croaking sound came from the left.

A pitch-black frog perched on a vine.

"Dark Abyss Toad!" Liu Wuxie's expression darkened. "Trouble has arrived."
###Chapter 496

The Lowell family living room was eerily silent.

Victoria Lowell watched her eldest son slumping on the sofa, tears streaming down her face.

"Maybe... we should go to Sophia?"

Her words dropped like a stone into still water.

William and Nathan looked up simultaneously, a flicker of hope in their eyes.

But it vanished just as quickly.

William massaged his temples. "Mom, Sophia won't interfere with these matters."

Nathan tugged at his tie irritably. "Our priority is solving the immediate crisis."

At Lowell Group headquarters, the PR manager rushed in, sweating profusely.

"Mr. Lowell, our official account's comments section is exploding!"

The computer screen flooded with accusatory questions.

"Is Dr. Quincy really sick?"
"Did Sophia Laurent sabotage this?"
"What exactly did Emily steal?"

Nathan slammed his fist on the desk. "Don't these internet trolls have anything better to do?"

William rose slowly, his gaze icy.

"If they want the truth, let's give it to them."

Thirty minutes later, Lowell Group's official account posted:

"Investigation confirms Emily Lowell stole Dr. Quincy's research and delivered it to Cunningham Group."

The post detonated across social media.

Within minutes, the top three trending topics were:
"Emily Lowell Theft Scandal"
"Cunningham Group Corporate Espionage"
"Emily Lowell & Ryan Cunningham"

Comments poured in like a tidal wave.

"OMG! Has Emily lost her mind?"
"The Lowells treated her so well, and this is how she repays them?"
"Cunningham Group is finished!"

At Cunningham Group headquarters, Ryan Cunningham stared at his screen, face dark with rage.

"Those Lowell idiots!"

He hurled his coffee cup against the wall.

They could have shared the research profits. Now everything was ruined.

His secretary hovered nervously by the door. "Mr. Cunningham, our stock is plummeting..."

Ryan's eyes turned venomous. "Get William Lowell on the phone."

Meanwhile, the three Lowell brothers stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, gazing at the city lights.

Daniel asked quietly, "William, what's our next move?"

A cold smile curled William's lips. "Let's watch the Cunninghams burn."
###Chapter 497 

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, but Ryan Cunningham's expression remained stormy.

He slammed the documents onto the desk, papers scattering everywhere.

"Have the Lowells lost their minds?"

Ryan Jr. sat behind the expansive desk, fingertips tapping rhythmically against the polished surface.

"They didn't just report Emily to the police. They're cutting all ties with us."

Ryan paced angrily, leather shoes clicking sharply against the marble floor.

"I thought they adored that adopted daughter. How could they throw her to the wolves?"

Ryan Jr.'s gaze drifted toward the city skyline.

"Sophia's the problem."

Ryan halted mid-step, brow furrowing.

"Explain."

"Dr. Quincy has defected to Sophia's side." Ryan Jr.'s voice turned icy. "The Lowells got played."

Understanding dawned on Ryan's face, twisting his features further.

"They'll come after us with everything they've got."

Ryan Jr. turned, eyes sharp as daggers.

"Deny everything."

He picked up a fountain pen, spinning it deftly between his fingers.

"Our research belongs to Cunningham Laboratories. The Lowells have no claim."

Ryan nodded slowly.

"I'll arrange for the tech team's relocation immediately."

Pulling out his phone, he dialed a number with quick precision.

"We'll need to secure Emily's release too."

Ryan Jr. gave a slight nod, expression inscrutable.

"She must remain our ally."

Meanwhile, Cunningham Group's press release trended across social media.

The concise statement denied all allegations with surgical precision.

Online chatter gradually subsided.

But inside Lowell Entertainment's boardroom, a furious fist slammed against the conference table.

"Outrageous!"

Richard Lowell's face flushed crimson as he hurled the tablet onto the table.

As tensions simmered between the two families, Sophia's phone buzzed unexpectedly.

"I'm downstairs."

Alexander Valdemar's rich baritone resonated through the receiver.

Sophia's lips curved upward involuntarily.

"Be right there."

In Pearl Group's lobby, Alexander sat perfectly composed on a leather sofa.

His elegant fingers turned the pages of a financial magazine, the tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders.

The crisp white shirt remained buttoned to the top, exuding restrained elegance.

"Oh my god, is that Mr. Valdemar?"

"Even more handsome than in magazines!"

Receptionists whispered behind their hands, cheeks pinkening.

Alexander ignored the attention, his focus fixed on the elevator doors.

Waiting for his wife.
###Chapter 498

Sophia Laurent stepped out of the elevator and immediately sensed the unusual tension in the corporate lobby.

Alexander Valdemar sat alone on the leather sofa in the lounge area, a three-meter radius around him completely empty.

Several female employees pretended to be busy near the water cooler, but their eyes kept darting toward him.

"Ms. Laurent!" Her assistant hurried over, whispering. "Mr. Valdemar has been waiting for you for half an hour."

Sophia arched an eyebrow and looked over.

The setting sun through the floor-to-ceiling windows cast a golden halo around the man. He wore an impeccably tailored black suit, his long fingers flipping through a financial magazine.

As if sensing her gaze, Alexander suddenly looked up.

Their eyes met. He closed the magazine and stood.

"Finished work?"

His deep voice made nearby employees gasp audibly.

Sophia heard a chorus of whispered reactions behind her.

"Oh my god, Mr. Valdemar's voice is so mesmerizing..."

"Is that level of attractiveness even real?"

"Did Ms. Laurent save the galaxy in her past life?"

Shaking her head in amusement, Sophia walked toward him.

Alexander naturally took her briefcase. "How are you feeling today?"

Ever since learning about her pregnancy, he'd been punctually waiting for her after work each day.

"I'm fine." She smiled. "You don't need to pick me up every day."

He didn't respond, instead carefully studying her complexion.

Lately he'd been poring over pregnancy guides and consulting obstetric specialists.

"The Patriarch wants us for dinner at the manor," he changed the subject. "Those old men from last night's birthday banquet called again today asking about you."

Sophia chuckled.

The Patriarch had thrown that lavish celebration specifically to show off his granddaughter-in-law to his friends.

They walked side by side toward the parking garage, their shadows stretching long in the sunset.

Alexander spoke suddenly. "The Patriarch knows about Emily Lowell."

Sophia's steps faltered slightly.

"He's displeased," Alexander said calmly. "Should I handle the Lowell family?"

"No." Sophia shook her head. "I'll deal with them myself."

She knew the Lowells too well—greedy, foolish sharks who smelled blood in the water.

Alexander studied her resolute profile, admiration flashing in his eyes.

This was what he admired about Sophia.

She never relied on others, always maintaining her clarity.

"Alright." He opened the car door. "Let me know if you need anything."

As the car pulled away from the office building, Sophia gazed at the passing scenery before remembering something.

"About the Matriarch yesterday—"

"Don't worry about her." Alexander cut in firmly. "I'm in charge of the Valdemar family now."

His tone brooked no argument.

Sophia's lips curved slightly.

This man always knew exactly when and how to give her the support she needed.
###Chapter 499

Are the Lowells all fools?

Any idiot would choose their biological daughter over an adopted one.

Yet the Lowells are clearly blind.

Patriarch Valdemar began preparing the banquet at dawn.

He researched dietary restrictions for pregnant women and arranged for the freshest ingredients to be airlifted in.

Besides Alexander and Sophia, he also invited Adrian, Julian, and his grandniece Vanessa.

Vanessa was the only girl in the Valdemar third generation, doted on since childhood.

She'd just returned from a global tour when she called the old man, still dusty from travel.

"Happy birthday, Grandfather!"

Her voice was bright and melodious.

"I saw the canals in Venice, watched sunsets in Santorini, and brought you handmade glassware..."

The Patriarch couldn't stop smiling.

"When are you coming home, Vanessa? I want to introduce someone to you."

Vanessa was the granddaughter of Patriarch Valdemar's younger brother.

Her parents lived overseas, so she'd grown up in the Valdemar household.

"Who is it? Why so mysterious?"

Her tone turned playful.

"Your cousin Alexander got married. You'll meet his wife Sophia today."

"No way!"

Vanessa's voice rose in surprise. "I actually have a sister-in-law now?"

"Would I lie about that?"

The old man sounded proud. "She's quite remarkable—beautiful and capable..."

"Well, I'll have to see for myself."

Vanessa hung up with a laugh and immediately searched online.

Discovering Sophia owned Pearl Entertainment and had connections with Gavin Croix, her eyes lit up.

A new sister-in-law...

She'd need an impressive welcome gift.

Vanessa arrived at the estate before the newlyweds.

Sophia heard silver-bell laughter the moment she stepped inside.

She paused in surprise.

The stern Patriarch rarely smiled, even with his own grandsons.

Who was this girl?
###Chapter 500

Sophia Laurent had just stepped across the threshold of Valdemar Manor when Patriarch Valdemar beckoned to her.

"Sophia, come here."

The elderly man wore a benevolent smile.

"This is Vanessa Valdemar, the youngest daughter of the Valdemar family."

"Vanessa, meet your sister-in-law Sophia Laurent."

Sophia gave a slight nod, her lips curving into a perfectly composed smile.

The living room held more than just Vanessa. Alexander Valdemar, Adrian Valdemar, and the disinherited Julian Valdemar were all present.

Adrian lounged lazily on the sofa, only lifting his eyelids briefly in greeting.

Julian appeared visibly disheveled, his shirt wrinkled and his gaze unfocused.

Alexander remained characteristically taciturn.

But Sophia could sense he seemed more at ease among family.

Vanessa clung affectionately to Patriarch Valdemar's arm.

"Hello, sister-in-law."

She tilted her head, eyes sparkling.

"Shouldn't you prepare a gift for your new little sister?"

Sophia blinked in surprise.

Then smiled gently.

"I came in a hurry today. May I give you something later?"

Vanessa immediately brightened.

"Really? Can I ask for anything I want?"

Adrian suddenly slammed his palm against the coffee table.

"Vanessa, have you lost your mind?"

Patriarch Valdemar frowned sharply. "Adrian!"

"Did you hear what she just said?"

Adrian mimicked Vanessa's tone with exaggerated disgust.

"Ugh—"

He made a gagging expression.

"Only you would indulge this nonsense."

Sophia instinctively moved closer to Alexander.

Patriarch Valdemar's beard quivered with anger.

"You insolent—"

Adrian shrugged indifferently.

"Perhaps you should ask who taught her such manners."

"She's your sister. Must you always provoke her?"

Adrian sneered and turned away.

The atmosphere turned icy.

Patriarch Valdemar gave Sophia an apologetic look.

"Don't mind him, Sophia."

She offered a gracious smile.

"I understand, Grandfather."

Vanessa suddenly stamped her foot.

Her eyes reddened as she bit her lip in distress.
