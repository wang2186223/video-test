###Chapter 1
It was already ten at night.
After reheating the dinner for the third time, Amelia Tudor finally heard the heavy front door open. Her husband, Chris Spencer, walked in, the cold night air clinging to his expensive wool coat.
Amelia stepped forward with practiced movements, helping him with his slippers and reaching for his briefcase. She tried to maintain the quiet, efficient role she had played for three years.
Chris let out a sharp, dry laugh. "Two billion dollars to keep a ghost in this house. My money has never been more wasted." His voice, deep and raspy, dripped with a sarcasm that cut through Amelia’s composure.
She froze, the sting of his words familiar but no less painful. She couldn't argue, because the foundation of their marriage was built on a lie she hadn't told, but was forced to pay for.
Three years ago, her mother, Nina Smith, had promised a grand alliance between the Tudor and Spencer families. But instead of the promised dowry, Nina had vanished with two billion dollars of the Spencer family’s capital, leaving Amelia to face the fallout. The scandal had turned Chris—a man of immense pride—into the city’s laughingstock, and his vengeance had been a cold, three-year silence.
"Since the Tudors chose to deceive me, you will bear the weight of their debt," Chris had told her on their wedding night. True to his word, he had treated her with a chilling indifference, as if touching her would be a surrender to the people who had robbed him.
Chris seated himself at the dining table, the silence between them heavy with years of unspoken resentment.
Amelia served a bowl of soup, her hand trembling slightly. She tried to sound casual. "Chris, is there... is there someone else you’d rather have here?"
Chris looked up, his eyes narrowing. "What are you playing at?"
"If you have someone you truly care for," Amelia whispered, "I can step aside. We can end this."
It was a plea for his happiness, and her own freedom. But before he could respond, Amelia’s world suddenly tilted. A dark veil seemed to drop over her eyes, turning the dining room into a blur of gray shadows. Panicked by the sudden blindness, she reached out blindly, her hand catching the edge of the table and knocking several plates to the floor with a deafening crash.
"Amelia! Have you lost your mind?" Chris snapped, standing up.
In the chaos, a small, light-blue pill slipped from Amelia’s pocket and skated across the hardwood floor. Chris picked it up, his expression twisting into a sneer as he recognized the potent, unlabelled sedative-relaxant.
"Resorting to these kinds of tricks now? Are you that desperate to secure your place here?"
"It's not... I didn't..." She wanted to explain that her mother had forced it on her that afternoon, a desperate attempt to manufacture an heir, but the words died in her throat.
Chris cut her off, his voice like ice. "Even if you were the last woman on earth, I wouldn't let a Tudor manipulate me again. Stop dreaming."
Amelia clutched the table, squeezing her eyes shut until her vision slowly, agonizingly returned to a hazy blur. By then, Chris was already storming away.
She knew her condition was worsening. Weeks ago, a doctor had warned her: “Miss Tudor, the retinal occlusion is progressing. If the stress doesn't decrease, you are looking at total permanent blindness.”
Because of her failing sight, her hearing had become hypersensitive. She heard the sharp notification sound from Chris's phone inside his briefcase. Her vision cleared just enough for her to see the name on the screen as she took the phone to the bathroom door.
"Chris? You have a message. It’s from... Leila Ross."
The silence from behind the door was deafening. Leila was Chris's first love, the popular singer who had just announced in a viral interview that she was returning to the country to "win back the one who got away."
The bathroom door swung open. Chris stood there, damp and radiating a sudden, restless energy. He snatched the phone without a word.
"Do you still care for her?" Amelia asked, her voice small.
"Don't touch my things again," he countered, his warning look sharp enough to draw blood.
When he emerged from the dressing room moments later, he was dressed in a sharp gray suit. He looked younger, more rebellious—like the man he might have been before the Tudor family had hardened his heart. Amelia watched him head for the door, the realization hitting her: he was going to her.
"Will you be back..."
The slamming of the door was her only answer.
That night, Amelia lay awake, the memory of her mother’s voice echoing like a curse. “If you can’t get pregnant, you’re useless to us, Amelia. Find a way. Seduce him, or find someone else who can give him an heir so we can keep the Spencer's money.”
Nina Smith saw her daughter not as a human being, but as a transaction. First, she had sold her to Chris for two billion, and then, on the day of the wedding, tried to sell her again to a seventy-year-old creditor for fifty million.
Amelia was trapped between a mother who used her and a husband who loathed her.
Suddenly, her phone rang. It was an unfamiliar number.
When she answered, a sweet, melodic female voice—one she recognized from a thousand hit songs—came through the line.
"Is this Amelia? Chris is a bit... overwhelmed tonight. Could you come and pick him up from my place?"





###Chapter 2

Premium Nightclub.
When Amelia reached the door of the private suite, the sound of glass shattering echoed from within. Fearing for Chris, she pushed inside without thinking. "Chris, are you—"
The room was filled with the city’s elite. In the center, Chris Spencer lounged on a velvet sofa, his shirt unbuttoned at the collar, looking every bit the cold, noble heir he was. Beside him sat a gorgeous woman, her hand resting intimately on his shoulder.
The sight felt like a physical blow. Amelia almost wished her vision would fail her again so she wouldn't have to witness her husband’s comfort with another woman.
"What are you doing here?" Chris’s voice cut through the music, sharp and full of disdain.
Amelia froze. Looking at his disgusted expression, she realized she had been lured here by Leila’s message. He wasn't in trouble; he was simply reminding her of her place.
"I... I thought you needed assistance," Amelia managed to say, her voice small.
Chris sneered. "Your excuses are as transparent as your family’s lies."
"Chris, don't be so hard on her. She’s just playing the devoted wife," the woman beside him said with a saccharine smile. This was Leila Ross—the ex-girlfriend whose return had been the talk of the town.
"Does she even have the right to care?" Chris countered, standing up. He leaned down, his voice a lethal whisper in Amelia’s ear. "Trying to play the role of Mrs. Spencer in front of my friends? Do you want to remind them how your mother sold you to the highest bidder?"
Amelia bit her lip, enduring the humiliation in silence. Her lack of reaction only seemed to irritate him further.
"Don't let there be a next time. Get out," he commanded, turning his back on her.
As Amelia retreated, the room erupted in mocking laughter. The insults followed her—words like "gold digger" and "shameless" pelted her like stones. They spoke of her as if she were a common swindler, someone who had forced her way into a world where she didn't belong.
Outside, the cold autumn wind bit at her skin. Suddenly, a red sports car screeched to a halt in front of her. Leila looked out from the driver’s seat, a smug smile on her lips.
"Quite a performance tonight, Amelia. Chris hates scenes, and you just gave him a grand one."
"The title of Mrs. Spencer is mine until I choose to let it go," Amelia replied, trying to find a shred of dignity.
Leila laughed. "Don't cling to what was never yours. Chris is coming over to my place later. We have a lot of lost time to make up for."
The car roared away, leaving Amelia alone in the dark. She spent the entire night on the sofa, waiting. By dawn, the house was still empty. Chris hadn't returned.
When heavy footsteps finally sounded at the door, Amelia—whose vision had temporarily blurred again—recognized his scent: a sharp, cold pinewood.
"You're back," she whispered, her voice dry.
As Chris approached, Amelia tried to stand, but her weakened legs gave out. She stumbled, falling forward, and for a fleeting second, she was caught by a broad, solid chest. Her hands instinctively touched his jacket, feeling the warmth beneath.
But the next second, he shoved her away with a look of pure revulsion. Amelia hit the floor, the impact sending a jolt of pain through her fragile frame.
"Amelia, how many times do I have to warn you? Stop these pathetic attempts at seduction," Chris growled, looming over her.
He didn't just see her as an unwanted wife; he saw her as a predator. He grabbed her arm, pulling her back onto the sofa before tossing her phone at her.
"Is this what your family is planning now?"
Amelia looked at the screen. The messages from her mother, Nina, were horrifying. They detailed a plan to use a third party to secure an heir, a scheme involving hidden payments and a faked pregnancy to ensure the Tudor family stayed attached to the Spencer fortune.
“As long as we get a child in that house, the Spencer billions are ours, Amelia. Find a woman, pay her off, and we’ll handle the rest.”
Every word was a brand of shame. Amelia felt sick. She was the one paying for her mother’s greed, trapped in a cycle of debt and loathing.
"I'm sorry," she whispered, the words feeling hollow. "I didn't know she would go this far."
"Sorry?" Chris laughed, a cold, hollow sound. "Your family is a parasite, and you are the host."
Amelia looked at him, her vision clearing just enough to see the sheer hatred in his eyes. She couldn't do this anymore. The darkness in her eyes was nothing compared to the darkness in this marriage.
"Let’s get a divorce," she said, her voice finally steady.
###Chapter 3

Amelia never thought she'd say this to Chris, but here she was..

Maybe she shouldn't have married him in the first place.

Tears streamed down her face uncontrollably while Chris just laughed.

He knew how much Amelia loved him. If she really wanted a divorce,she would've done it ages ago. This was just one of her tricks!

Chris grabbed Amelia's chin roughly, his eyes full of contempt. "Playing hard to get? Amelia, you're getting better at this."

Chris was sure Amelia wouldn't go through with the divorce.

And he was right. Amelia didn't say a word, just turned around and hurried upstairs.

In the bedroom, everything wwas pitch black. She stumbled to the bedside table, opened the drawer, and found a bottle of pills.

She couldn't remember where she put her water glass, so she just swallowed a handful of pills dry. Leaning against the wall, she squatted on the ground, tears streaming down her face.

She clearly saw the red lipstick mark on Chris's collar, bright and sarcastic,like a victor's flag.


Leila was right; they hadn't seen each other for a long time. He was so passionate that he didn't even mind the lipstick mark on his collar, despite his usual fastidiousness.


Wasn't this proof of their love? It seemed she really had to give back this
identity thatdidn't belong to her to his lover.

Just when Chris thought Amelia would make a fuss as usual and then settle down.she placed a document in front of him.

Chris said, "Take a look. If there's no problem, sign it, and we'll go to City Hall together."

Hearing this, Chris's eyes widened.

He picked up the document and saw the title "Divorce Agreement" glaring at him.

What surprised him even more was the small line at the bottom: "Both parties have no children born in wedlock, no joint property to divide."

Amelia,who always valued money, would willingly leave with nothing?

Chris sneered, "Alright, if you want a divorce, let's go now."

From what he knew of Amelia, she wouldn't step out of this house. She might even cry and beg him, saying she was wrong, regretted it, and begged him not to divorce...

"Wait a moment; I'll change my clothes." Amelia's voice was calm.

For the divorce, she still wanted to be dignified. After all,their wedding was not dignified at all. Now, she just wanted to put a decent end to this marriage.


Soon, Amelía came out dressed. She wore a simple knee-length dress, her long hair elegantly swept up,and her face adorned with delicate, light makeup.With an understated sophistication, she radiated a refined beauty from within.
"Let's go." Facing the divorce, Amelia was surprisingly calm.

It was at this moment that Chris truly realized that Amelia was serious about the divorce.

For some reason, a burning fire of irritation ignited in his heart.

Just then, his phone rang. Chris glanced at the phone screen and hurriedly said, "Something came up at the office; let's get a divorce another day."

After that, Chris didn't come home for several days.


During these days, he no longer received the daily 3 PM text from Amelia asking if he would come home for dinner, which she had sent for three years. Did she realize her mistake and was too ashamed to message him?

In the evening, Chris received a call from the housekeeper, Zola Long. "Mr.Spencer, I came to clean today and haven't seen Mrs. Spencer all day."

Zola came to the house for a thorough cleaning once a week. Because Amelia said she had nothing to do, shecould handle cleaning, laundry,and cooking herself.

"Don't worry about her." Chris didn't take it seriously.

"But Mr. Spencer..." Zola stammered, "Mr. Spencer, when I was cleaning the room, I found that Mrs. Spencer's clothes were all gone, and..."

Chris asked,"And what?"

Zola said, "Mrs. Spencer has left you a divorce agreement along with a note stating, 'Contact me at your convenience to finalize the dlivorce proceedings."

Hearing this, Chris's eyes narrowed1. He never thought Amelia would leave
him.

For three years, no matter how excessive or hurtful his actions were,she silently endured them. This time,she was serious?

Amelia stayed at the Tudor Villa for a week, and Nina was already suspicious.

When Nina saw Chris being interviewed on a financial channel on TV,she flew into a rage and stormed into Amelia'sroom. "Didn't you say Chris was on a business trip, so you came back to stay for a few days? Chris is clearly in Pinecrest! Instead of taking care of him at home,why are you here?"

Something was off. Nina knew her daughter Amelia better than anyone.No matter how much grief Chris caused her, Amelia wouldn't just leave him. Thus there was just one reason.

Without a word, Nina yanked Amelia off the bed, grabbing her by the collar. "Did Chris kick you out? Is he divorcing you?"

When Amelia left the Spencer Villa that day, it was during the last autumn rain before winter. She got caught in the rain on her way back, and by the time she reached home, she had developed a high fever that left her bedridden.


After being roughly pulled out of bed by Nina, Amelia's head was so heavy she could barely stand.

It took all of Amelia's strength to say, "I'm planning to divorce him."

Immediately, Nina slapped Amelia across the face and angrily scolded, "I don't care; you go back right now and beg for his forgiveness! Otherwise...Mr. Brown just lost his wife, I'll marry you off to him tomorrow! Our
Tudor family must rely on a powerful family, and which family that is depends on you!"

The Mr. Brown Nina mentioned was someone Amelia knew; his family was in the mining buasiness, and he must be over seventy years old by now.

Amelia gave a bitter smile, finding it hard to believe someone could marry their own daughter to an old man nearing death.

But she knew that with Nina's obsession with money and power,she could do anything.

Amelia couldn't understand why. Clearly, she and Karen Tudor were both children of the Tudor family; why were they treated so differently?

Karen had everything she wanted, could do what she wanted, and could fall in love freely, living like a carefree princess from childhood.

As for Amelia, simply because she had congenital visual impairment, was she fated to be the abandoned child, destined to be manipulated from the moment she was born?


"What are you still standing there for? Hurry up and get the fucking back to the Spencer Villa!" Nina impatiently shoved Amelia's shoulder hard.


With a loud bang, caught off guard, Amelia was pushed backward, hitting the back of her head heavily on the corner of the bed. She passed out immediately.

When she woke up, it was already the next day. The pungent smell of disinfectant and the occasional beeping of monitoring equipment told her she was in a hospital.

"You're awake?" Sophia Parker, who had been by her side, sighed in relief
when she saw Amelia finally open her eyes. "Amelia, listen to me; get the surgery as soon as possible. Right now, you are only experiencing a decline in vision, but when the symptoms of temporary blindness start to manifest,they will occur frequently and last longer, pbtentially leading to complete blindness. If not treated promptly, it might be too late!"

Sophia was not only Amelia's best friend but also a renowned ophthalmologist in the country.

"I..."

Amelia didn't know how to tell her that she already had symptoms of temporary blindness for three times. Was it already too late?

Amelia said, "I need to think about it."

She still had something important to do. And the key point is, she hadn't even taken one last earnest look at her beloved Chris.

With that, Amelia turned over, facing away from Sophia, and said softly, "T m tired;I want to rest."

Sophía didn't say mnuch and left.

Not long after, Amelia heard footsteps approaching, followed by a sarcastic laugh. "I heard you're quite ill?"


Amelia was particularly sensitive to voices and knew immediately that it was Leila.


Leila said, "Even with surgery, the chances of a full recovery are only thirty percent. You've consistently refused the operation because you're afraid of being dumped by Chris if being completely blind. Am I right?"
Leila was somewhat right. Amelia was concerned about losing her sight,but she wasn't afraid of being abandoned. What she feared was never being able to see Chris again.

Amelia bit her lip and said nothing.


Leila thought she was right and continued, "What do you think would happen if I told Chris's parents about your congenital visual impairment?"
###Chapter 4

Amelia's face went rigid, a cold glint flashing in her eyes, but she kept her mouth shut.

"You know the fallout if this grets out," Leila sneered, clearly pleased with Amelia's reaction. "If you back out now, you might save some face. Think about it."

Outside, the rain was starting to come down harder.

Amelia told herself to take one last, long look at Chris. Then she'd give up and do what she had to do.

With a clap of thunder, the taxi dropped Amelia off outside the Spencer Villa.


She covered her head with her hands and dashed back.

In the downpour, her vision was blurry, and she had to rely on her instincts to find her way.


As she got closer to the main building, she spotted a familiar figure in the distance.


"Dad,what are you doing here? Shouldn't you be in the hospital?" Amelia asked,shocked when she realized who it was. It was Paxton Tudor.His health had been failing over the past couple of years, making him a regular at the hospital. With his company in a shaky state, he was always busy and rarely had time for Amelia.


"How touching, a father-daughter reunion," Chris said coldly, looking down at them from the steps, like a king surveying his subjects..
"Amelia, I'm fine," Paxton said with a sad smile before looking up to Chris.

"Chris, Amelia's all alone now." Paxton pleaded. "If you divorce her,with the Spencer family's power, what will she do? Please, don't do this.Be with anyone you want, just don't abandon Amelia!"

In the pouring rain, Paxton's clothes were soaked through. Rainwater streamed down his face, highlighting the worry and helplessness etched into his features.

Amelia's heart broke. Tears streamed down her face as she clung to Paxton's arm, shouting, "Let's go, Dad. I'm begging you!"

She had already lost all her dignity; could she endure more humiliation?

"Amelia, beg him with me! He'll consider the time you two spent together and keep you," Paxton urged, gripping her hand tightly, his face pale and voice hoarse. "Hurry up. Beg him now!"

Amelia gritted her teeth and growled, "Let's go."

"You've got some nerve,getting your father to plead for you," Chris finally spoke, mocking her. "Too bad, you're not worth it."


Amelía's heart felt like it was being stabbed with needles; she forced herself to look up at him.

Their eyes met; he was still noble, while she was a mess.


The heavy rain didn't diminish his aura but made him seem even more aloof and arrogant, a stark contrast to her wretched state.

Holding back her tears, Amelia pleaded, "Dad, let's go; he won't agree."

Paxton gritted his teeth. "You can only rely on him now!"
Before he could finish, he started coughing urgently, his eyes filled with worry and sadness.

His health was in a critical state now, and he couldn't protect Amelia's future. Once divorced, Amelia would be an easy target for their enemies,and her life would be in shambles.

"Mr. Tudor, do you think your presence here will make me feel guilty?"Chris's voice was icy, a look of disgust flashing in his deep eyes. "What makes you think I'd pity her?"

A woman who had brought him such disgrace didn't deserve even a shred of his affection.


Paxton pleaded, "Just for my sake."

"Dad, stop it." Amelia dropped to her knees. "I'm begging you; let's go."

"Amelia, you, you..." Paxton couldn't finish his sentence, suddenly clutching his chest and collapsing, unconscious.

"Dad! Dad!" Amelia cried out, trying to support his falling body. "Someone call an ambulance!"


Paxton had a sudden heart attack, barely escaping death.

Amelia stayed in the intensive care unit all night, on the verge of breaking down multiple times. Could her world get any darker than this?


"Your dad was fine in the hospital; how did he suddenly run out and have an attack?" Nina's sharp voice cut through the air behind Amelia."You wretch, haven't you done enough to our family? You're a jinx;you ruined the company, and now you're harming your father!"
Nina's loud voice drew a crowd outside the ward, all watching Amelia's misery.

Amelia sat there quietly, taking it all in.

"Speak, are you dead?" Nina pinched Amelia's arm hard. "Did you even try to beg Chris? If he insists on divorcing you,you..."

"I will never beg him again!" Amelia süddenly looked up, her voice trembling. "I want a divorce."


No one knew how she got through the night. She replayed every moment from the first sight to the marriage between her and Chirs in her mind.And it turned out to be a joke and tragedy from the beginning. Only she,the fool, thought she was holding on to true love. Last night's heavy rain washed away the last bit of hope she had in this self-deceiving love.Moreover, she didn't want her family to suffer such humiliation again. She was determined to divorce Chris.

"What?" Nina asked in disbelief. "Do you know what you're saying?Amelia, are you out of your mind?"

Amelia didn't respond.


Nina snapped, "Wretch, you want a divorce? No way! Your father is in this state, and our company is on the brink of collapse. If you get divorced,how will our family survive? If you dare to divorce, I'll marry you off to that seventy-year-old Mr. Brown!"

Nina's furious words filled the ward, making Amelia feel suffocated.

Nina yelled, "Wretch, speak!"

Seeing Amelia still bowing her head in silence, Nina slapped her hard.
Amelia was unprepared and fell to the ground. A sharp pain hit her, her vision went black, and she lost consciousness.

When she woke up again, she was in a warm bed.

Amelia opened her eyes in a daze, only to find herself in the pink room of her close friend,Sophia.

"Awake?" Sophia brought a cup of warm water. "You were unconscious for several hours, but you're finally awake. How do you feel?"

Amelia didn't respond; instead, she urgently asked with a hoarse voice,"How is my dad?"
###Chapter 5

"You should worry about yourself first. Don't your eyes feel super uncomfortable?"

Sophia grabbed her wrist, her voice icy and serious. "In your condition,you can't handle any more stress. If this keeps up, you might wake up one day and not be able to see anything."

Amelia gave a bitter smile. Lately, everything had been so chaotic that she almost forgot to take care of herself.

"It's fine; things will get better." She forced a smile. "Sophia,I want to see my dad."


"Your dad's been moved to another hospital, and I don't know where. I suggest you don't do anything rash, or your mom would sell you to that seventy-year-old guy." Sophia sighed.

Amelia was stunned, but Sophia hadl a point. She didn't dare to take a risk.She decided to wait until she divorced Chris, which was just a few days away.


On the day of the divorce, Sophia woke 'Amelia up early and got her all dolled up. Amelia was confused. "We're getting divorced; why dress up so nicely?"


"You don't get it. This is exactly what we want! When he sees you looking so beautiful and elegant, he'll definitely regret being so determined to divorce you."

Sophia kept fussing over Amelia in the mirror, still not satisfied,and changed her into another dress.
When Amnelia, in her stiletto heels, arrived at the entrance of City Hall,she saw a sleek black SUV parked there, radiating an air of unapproachable dominance. Chris wvas in the driver's seat. The window was half-open,showing his cold profile. The sunlight slanted over him, but he still gave off a chilly vibe.


As Chris noticed Amelia out of the corner of his eye, he pushed open the car door. His long legs came out first,and then he stood in front of her.

As always, he looked noble and aloof, as if he were above it all.Chris asked,"Don't tell me you are late because you were getting dressed up."

Chris's narrow eyes glanced at her indifferently, his face full of coldness.

Amelia's face immediately turned red, and she awkwardly walked into the City Hall.

Today she wore a beige long dress, her hair, usually tied up, was let down,softly draping over her shoulders. As she moved, her hair swayed, and a faint fragrance spread. In the sunlight, she was enveloped in an indescribable purity and charm.


Due to the discomfort of her high heels, Amelia walked slowly,fearful that a misstep might lead to an embarrassing stumble.

"Stop!" Chris took a big step to catch up with her and grabbed her wrist.

Unprepared,she stumbled, her long hair brushing against his face.

Chris's shoulder stiffened slightly, his anger subsiding a bit. "I'm talking to you!" He gritted his teeth, staring into her eyes.

Their eyes met, and he inexplicably saw himself reflected in her clear eyes.
"Let go." Amelia's breathing was a bit rapid, her wrist already red from his grip.

Chris sneered. "You better keep this attitude; don't beg me."

As Amelia pulled her hand back forcefully and took a deep breath. "Mr.Spencer, we're here to get a divorce, I don't think we need to talk. A clean break is better than anything."

She took a step back, stepping onto the stairs, trying to appear calm and steady. But her slightly trembling legs betrayed her nervousness.

Amelia mustered up the courage to add, "After all, this is a public place.If someone captures Mr. Spencer's inappropriate behavior, I guess Ms. Ross would be heartbroken." With that, she walked away immediately.

In just a few steps, she felt a cold gaze on her back.

Chris didn't use his influence to get special treatment or clear the area for exclusive service. They took a queue number and sat separately to wait.

Amelia pulled out her phone, trying to contact Paxton. But after sending over a dozen messages without a reply, she grew increasingly worried,wondering if she should go find him after this was over.


Chris sat alone in another row of public seats. His presence was so intimidating that no one dared to approach him.

"Who is he? He's so handsome. Do such handsome men get divorced too?"

"Of course, no matter how good-looking a guy is, he'sstill human,and divorce is always a possibility."

"He's so handsome; I think I've seen him on TV, Could he be a celebrity?"
People around whispered, alI showing strong interest in Chris's striking appearance.

Amelia, with a chilly demeanor, stared intently at the number in her hand.focusing on waiting.

She couldn't let her mind wander, or she would uncontrollably think about life without Chris, which would surely be bleak. Once she started thinking,she couldn't bear to divorce Chris.

Across the aisle, Chris's eyes darkened as he stared at Amelia, observing her calm demeanor.

This was rare in the past three years. They had come to the City Hall,and Amelia still hadn't begged for mercy?

Suddenly, he stood up and walked straight towards Amelia. "Come out with me," he commanded,his voice full of pressure.

Amelia frowned. It was almost their turn; there was no need to delay for anything else. So she said softly, "Let's get the divorce first."

It seemed like she was eager to divorce, while he was deliberately stalling.Wasn't Chris the one who always wanted the divorce? But looking at her indifferent face,Chris just felt uncomfortable.


"Come out!" He used force to pull her out.

Amelia almost fell from his pull. She felt panicked and said coldly, "Let go of me!"


She had endured and suppressed for three years, all her dignity had been trampled.
Was she to be humiliated by him in public at the last moment? She just wanted a divorce, to return to their correct paths.

"Amelia, are you looking for trouble?" Chris brushed off non-existent dust from his hand,exuding a cold aura.

This was a sign of his anger.

"No matter what you say, let's get the divorce first!" Amelia took a deep breath, gritting her teeth, standing firm against him for the first time.

Chris's deep brown eyes turned sinister.

Under such a murderous gaze, Amelia didn't back down. She walked step by step to the counter; it was their turn.

If observed closely, one would see her back trembling. This was her muscle memory of fear towards him.

Seeing Amelia sign her name without hesitation, Chris sneered and thought.What trick is she playing this time?'

She planned to use divorce to threaten him for more benefits,such as rescuing the Tudor family and saving her father? Did she think he didn't dare to divorce?


Chris laughed mockingly, quickly signing his name with a cold face.


When Amelia was informed that there was a thirty-day consideration period,she felt a bit frustrated.

She had finally mustered the courage, but the divorce wasn't final yet. But it was okay; a month would pass quickly.

Chris mocked, "You are such filial. With your father half-dead in the
hospital, you still have the mood to insist on the divorce."

Amelia was shocked. "What did you say?"

Chris's smile grew more pronounced. "Your eyes are bad,and your ears are deaf too?"


With that, he turned and left.


Amelia hurried to catch up and asked; "Where is my dad now?"
###Chapter 6

Sophia mentioned that her dad had been moved to another hospital,but she had no clue where.

From what Chris said, Amelia figured Paxton was probably with him.

"Why should I tell you?" Chris sneered, grabbing her chin firmly and making her look up. "Miss Tudor, weren't you all tough just now? Why the sudden change?"

He laughed, a nasty sound.

Amelia froze, tears filling her eyes.

She was lost. How did she end up dealing with such a jerk?

In a flash, Chris let go and got into his car.

Amelia ran after him, pounding on the window, tears streaming down her face. "Chris, where's my dad? Tell me!"

Chris started the car, driving slowly so she could keep up and suffer. He was quite pleased to see her in a messy state.

"Chris, tell me! Where's my dad?" Amelia's voice shook, and she tripped,falling forward. A car horn blared, brakes screeched.

At the last second, a strong arm pulled her back.


"Are you okay? How could you be so careless?" A man, shocked and worried,held her shoulders. "Amelia, is that you?"

"Shawn?" Their eyes met, and she recognized him.
Shawn Jones, an old classmate who always competed with her but never won. He was always second, always teased.

They were academic rivals all through school, right up to the final exam where Amelia came out on top.

"What are you doing here?" Shawn looked surprised.

Seeing her like this, he couldn't believe it. How did the strong, capable Amelia end up like this?

"Can you help me?" Amelia's voice was rough as she pointed to the black SUV driving away. "Help me catch that car."

Shawn didn't hesitate.

He helped her into the passenger seát. "Buckle up and hold on!"

He drove fast, catching up with Chris in minutes.

"Who is he? Why are you chasing him? You almost got hit! He is such a terrible guy" Shawn glanced over while driving.

Chris rolled down his window, his sharp eyes scanning them.

Shawn tensed.


Amelia grabbed Shawn's shoulder, glaring at Chris. "Where's my dad,Chris? Don't be so despicable! If anything happens to him, I'll never forgive you!"

Chris sneered, but his eyes lingered on her hand.

She was almost leaning on Shawn, close, but she didn't seem to notice.
Chris's eyes narrowed, anger flaring. He pulled over and got out quickly.

Shawn stopped too.

Before they could react, Chris was at their car, yanking Amelia out.

Shawn grabbed her arm in a hurry. "Hey! What's going on? How can I help you?"

Before he could finish, Chris had pulled her away, almost carrying her out.He roughly took off her shawl and tossed it aside, disgusted that it had been touched by an unknown man.

"Are you crazy? What are you doing?" Amelia, now in a white camisole dress, glared at him. However, her anger had no real force, making her look like an angry kitten.

Chris was amused by her reaction. "You think I'm interested in you?"He sneered, shoving her into the passenger seat without another word.

Amelia kept quiet. She knew he was taking her to see Paxton.


Chris was driving like a maniac, speeding up and slowing down randomly,like he was trying to shake someone off.


After about ten minutes, Amelia noticed something odd. In the rearview mirror,she saw Shawn's car tailing them at a steady distance.

When Chris sped up, Shawn sped up. When Chris slowed down, Shawn slowed down. He couldn't lose him.


"Who the hell is he?" Chris growled, teeth clenched.

Amelia stayed silent.
"Answer me!" His tone was harsh, his whole vibe menacing.

Amelia shivered, tears welling up. She wiped her face, smudging her makeup.

Seeing her like that, Chris suddenly stopped questioning and slammed the steering wheel. "Fuck!"

They finally pulled up to a private hospital.


Amelia rushed to the inpatient building and found out Paxton wvas on the first floor. She ran in.

Paxton was awake, a nurse helping him with his meds.

When he saw Amelia, he lit up. "Amelia, you're here.Where's Chris?"

Amelia didn't answer. She ran to him, hugging him tight. "Dad, I'm so glad you're okay. I was so worried. How did you end up here? Did they treat you well? How are the doctors?"

Paxton gently patted her head. "Silly girl, it's all thanks to Chris. He got me transferred here and found a new medical team. They said I just..."

"The patient shouldn't talk too much now. Let him rest," the nurse cut in.

Amelia was stunned. Paxton had just had an episode. That meant when she was with Chris at City Hall, he knew Paxton wasn't well and insisted on taking her out. Could he be that considerate?

She didn't dwell on it. She helped Paxton lie down, chatted with him a bit,and coaxed him to sleep.

After a while, she reluctantly left the room.
Chris was sitting on a bench in the hallway, waiting. Legs crossed,phone in hand, he looked like any other guy, except for his striking looks and commanding presence. But she knew better than to have any illusions about him or to thank him.

"Shawn Jones, heir to the Jones family and a wannabe race car driver. No wonder he kept up with me." Chris looked up, giving her a pointed look."But does the little Jones family think they can mess with me?"

Amelia's heart sank. "I just ran into him. He hasn't done anything to you.Please, don't cause him any trouble."

As soon as she said it, she realized it might put Shawn in danger, so she quickly shut up.

She knew Chris too well. As his ex-wife, she was fully aware of his possessiveness. Even if he didn't care for her, he'd lose it if he thought she had an affair during their marriage.

Chris slowly stood, his tall frame looming over her. "He's still outside,demanding to see you."
###Chapter 7

Chris glared down at her, his words dripping with venom.

Amelia felt like a puppet, completely at his mercy, stripped of any dignity.

"You just divorced me and you're already hunting for husband number two?" Chris sneered, seeing her bite her lip in silence. "Dressing up like a courtesan, hoping to trade yourself for a better price?"

"Shut up!" Amelia snapped, her patience finally breaking.


Her eyes were red, locked onto his. "Why do you even care about what I do? Can't let go,huh? Regretting the divorce? How can you say such nasty things-Mr.Spencer,you never fail to surprise me!"

"I'm the nasty one?" Chris's smile vanished, replaced by a deep hate. "Who could be more vicious than you?"

His cold, stern gaze reminded her of the past, though those actions weren't her choice.


"What do you want from me? Even if I was wrong, haven't I paid enough?We're divorced. Fine, target me, but why go after an innocent person?"Amelia wiped her tears, her voice filled with hatred.

"Target him?" Chris sneered. "Is he even worth it?"


Amelia's back stiffened as she saw him wave dismissively, telling his subordinate, "Let that fool go."

She sighed in relief, but Chris's mocking voice cut through again,"That playboy's handsome enough for you. Make sure you sell yourself for a high price."
Amelia's mind went blank. His words echoed in her ears. Did he hate her that much? Had he never cared for her?

"Mr. Spencer, save your concern!" Amelia, gathering her strength,said firmly, "Who I marry or what happens to me is none of your business."

"Not so fast." Chris crossed his arms, eyeing her.

"What do you mean?" Amelia gritted her teeth.

One of Chris's assistants stepped forward, handing her a medical bill. "Miss Tudor, this is the amount your father has spent since yesterday,totaling eighty thousand dollars. His condition is unstable, and he needs to stay in the hospital for a few more days. You'll need to pay five hundred thousand dollars."


Amelia's heart shocked. Chris's private hospital was worth the price,but she was barely getting by. How could she come up with that kind of money?

"I think it's a smaIl matter for Miss Tudor. After all, you sold yourself for two billion dollars back then." Chris's gaze was icy, his expression meaningful. What he meant was that she could sell herself again for about the similar price.


Amelia's self-esteem and love were so crushed that she couldn't speak,her heart aching heavily. She clenched her hand and turned to leave.

"Miss Tudor, you need to pay within a week," the assistant reminded.

"I will!" Amelia shot a glance at Chris.

This time, his coldness cut deep, leaving her with no lingering affection or regret.
How was she going to earn five hundred thousand dollars? She'd been a housewife for years, with no job. Even if someone hired her now,how could she make that much in a week?

Amelia walked out of the hospital in a daze, seeing Shawn approaching.

"What's your deal with Chris? Why's he treating you like this? Even if he's rich, this is too much," he asked, worried.

Amelia felt a flicker of warmth,ready to speak but held back. They were just school acquaintances; she couldn't drag him into this.

"Nothing, really. Thanks for today." She forced a smile. "I gotta go."

"How are you getting home? Don't rush off. Let me get your contact info.You can treat me to a meal later to say thanks." Shawn caught up,showing his phone number. "Add me."

Amelia hesitated but eventually added his number.

"How did you end up like this? I remember back then you..." Shawn trailed off, "Never mind. If you need any help, just let me know."

Amelia stopped, Chris's mocking face flashing in her mind.

She pursed her lips. "I don't need your help."

Shawn looked puzzled, "But I heard you owe him hundreds of thousands.
I can lend it to you; just pay me some interest."

Amelia snapped, "I said I don't need it!"

After being mocked by Chris and facing the pressure of five hundred thousand dollars, Amelia was on the verge of breaking down. "Don't you get it?"
As soon as she said it, she regretted it. Why was she taking it out on Shawn? If she had the guts,why not take it out on Chris?

"Sorry..." she mumbled.

Her eyes welled up with tears as she glanced at him, guilt-ridden. Feeling helpless, she crouched down, hugging her knees, her voice filled with despair. "What should I do?"

Shawn, not the most observant guy, could still see she was having a rough day. He didn't mind her outburst but hated seeing a girl sad. Scratching his head, his eyes lit up. "I have a friend who owns a music restaurant.They're looking for a piano player, and the pay is good. You should give it a shot."


He remembered Amelia had won several international piano competitions in high school.


"Really? That would be amazing." Amelia wiped her tears. "Can I go now?"Shawn drove her to the place.

Sapphire Music Restaurant.

Amelia knew this place; it looked low-key on the outside but was a high-end spot frequented by Chris's friends, known for its style and high prices.


Working here, she might run into people she knew. But what did it matter now?


Shawn introduced her to the manager, Gary Barnes. After playing a piece,she signed a one-year contract on the spot.

She didn't hesitate. The divorce left her with nothing.
She needed to work hard now, at least to support herself.

"Mr. Barnes, I'm short on money right now. Can you schedule me more shifts,preferably every day?" Amelia asked Gary.

The contract required her to work at least fifteen days a month,performing according to the schedule. The salary was twenty thousand dollars a day, paid daily. If she could work continuously for a week, she could make one hundred forty thousand dollars, and with some other ways, it was possible to earn five hundred thousand dollars.

For Shawvn's sake, Gary agreed.

The next afternoon, as Amelia donned her gown and took her place on the stage, it felt like she was transported back to her student days, before she lost everything. Back then, the Tudor family wasn't facing financial ruin.and though she lacked her mother's affection, Paxton doted on her. He always said he had to make up for the ten years she was abandoned by her mother in the countryside due to her vision problems.

Amelia was engulfed in memories, channeling those emotions into her performance. From her playing, you could hear her journey from confusion,through sorrow, to acceptance. The beautiful and melodious tune flowed from her fingertips, swirling in the large restaurant.

"Is she your friend?"

On the second floor, a man with glasses swirled his wine glass, asking Shawn beside him.
###Chapter 8

Shawn nodded, his eyes glued to Amelia as she poured her heart into her performance. "Yeah, she's having a tough time."

The music hit Shawn hard, and he couldn't tear himself away.

Lucius Howard's lips twisted into a cold smile as he shot Shawn a knowing look. "You better think twice before stepping in for her, or it will cause trouble for you."

"Why?" Shawn paused mid-sip, caught off guard by Lucius's warning.


Lucius was usually aloof, it was rare for him to offer any advice.

"She's not someone you want to get involved with," Lucius chuckled, as if recalling something amusing. "Trust me, keep your distance."

With that, he turned and walked away, his tall, lean frame radiating an icy detachment.


Normally, Shawn would heed Lucius's advice. He had a long-standing friendship with Shawn's father and rarely offered Shawn any guidance.Most people never even got a chance to talk to Lucius.

But a rebellious spark ignited in Shawn. "I want to see why Amelia is off-limits." The stark difference between Amelia's past and present intrigued him.


Meanwhile, Amelia had no clue that her fate had just been nudged by a powerful hand.

She was just grateful for the chance and focused on her performance.
Luckily, she'd played the piano in the Spencer Villa's living room over the years,so she wasn't too rusty, even if the Spencer family often looked down on her for it.

The first day's performance went off without a hitch.

Gary transferred the salary to herand said, "Keep it up! Lots of guests loved your playing today."

Encouraged, Amelia showed up early the next morning.

For four days straight, she received kindness and praise, and managed to avoid any trouble.

But that afternoon, as she was about to leave, she had a little mishap.

"Sophia, wait for me at home. I'm going out to get groceries, tonight we..."Before she could finish, her phone was knocked to the ground by someone,and she almost fell.


A pair of strong arms caught her. Their eyes met, and a chill ran down Amelia's spine. How did she end up running into Lucius here?

Lucius was the enigmatic and powerful figure in the Spencer family.Besides Chris, he was the only one in line to inherit, and one of the few who could stand up to Chris.

Apart from Chris's grandfather, Lucius was the only one who dared to speak his mind in front of Chris, even though he was just the adopted son of the Spencer family.

Lucius had never interacted with Amelia, never even seen her at Spencer family events. She'd been overlooked for years, and Lucius had no reason to know her. So, even though they were technically family, it didn't mean
much.

"Sorry..." Amelia felt helpless.

Lucius, with his rimmed glasses that always seemed to hide his emotions,gave off an air of detachment. "Are you okay?" He had someone pick up her phone and hand it back to her.

Amelia felt a chill and instinctively wanted to step back from his intense presence.

"I'm fine," she said, turning to leave.

"Miss Tudor," Lucius called out suddenly.

Amelia's back stiffened.

She felt an inexplicable coldness, thinking this adopted son of the Spencer family was even more intimidating than the ruthless Chris.

"What's up?" she asked, surprised he knew who she was.

"Your piano playing is excellent, and the restaurant's customer satisfaction has been high these past few days," Lucius smiled.

Amelia finally realized Lucius owned the restaurant where she worked.

"Thank you." After years of being a housewife, it was the first time someone acknowledged her worth, and she smiled slightly. "I'll keep working hard."

She didn't dare stay any longer; Lucius's gaze carried an emotion she couldn't decipher.

Lucius watched her leave, his gaze deep.
"Mr. Howard," the male assistant who had helped pick up her phone said softly, "Miss Tudor's eyes resemble Ms. White's a bit."

Maybe it was the reason that Mr. Howard paid attention to her.

"Jace,how long have you been with me?" Lucius didn't look away, still indifferent.

Jace Smith's expression changed dramatically. He lowered his head and held his breath. "Three years."

"Is that so?" Lucius said calmly, "You can leave now."

Those words meant he was fired. Jace's face turned pale, and he didn't dare speak.

Jace thought, 'But why? Did I say something wrong? Amelia and Bella White did resemble each other, especially in their eyes.'

Lucius brushed off non-existent dust from his sleeve with one hand, then turned and walked away. Amelia looks like Bella? She didn't deserve it.

On the sixth day, including tips, Amelia had earned a hundred thousand dollars, but it was still far from the five hundred thousand she needed.


During these days, she had been trying to find other ways to make money,but all had failed.


Sophia was also short on money and couldn't lend her any. Although Shawn had offered several times,she had refused.

Amelia decided to finish today's work first and think of a way later.

"Isn't that Amelia? What's she doing here?" A familiar yet strange male voice called out, and Amelia couldn't help but be stunned.
She glanced towards the restaurant entrance and saw several familiar figures.

The man who had just spoken was Leila's friend. These individuals were all part of his gang, not a single decent person among them.

Every time they met before, he would humiliate her like teasing a pet,and those around him would laugh uproariously. Were they planning to torment her again?

"Don't you recognize us?" The man walked over directly.
###Chapter 9

The others sauntered over, smirking with that smug look, like they were staring at a toy they could mess with anytime.

"Ace, looks like she's playing the piano here. I heard a bunch of foreigners come to listen and tip her well," someone chimed in.

Ace Hal burst out laughing. "Wow, Amelia, what happened to you? You used to be the lady of a rich family. How did you end up working in a place like this? Doesn't anyone care about you anymore?"

"No wonder she's Mr. Spencer's wife; she's pretty hot. Come on, play us a tune,just for us."


"Don't be ridiculous. Does she even deserve the title of Mrs. Spencer? Chris never acknowledged her. For a woman who made him a joke, he's kind enough not to kill her. If it were up to me... I'd let the guys have some fun with her; it'd be a waste not to."

The group laughed crudely, their eyes glued to Amelia.

Amelia swallowed her anger, staying calm as she played some soothing music.


There were bodyguards around; they wouldn't just let these 'jerks act up.Sure enough, within minutes, a few bodyguards came over and shoved them out.


Amelia let out a sigh of relief. After her shift, she was trying to catch a cab when those guys cornered her again.

Ace stood in front of her, looking cold. "Amelia, why didn't you say hi?We know each other, right? We could at least be called friends."
As he spoke, his hand reached out to touch her face.

Amelia's face turned icy, and she slapped him hard. "Get lost!"

The slap echoed loudly, leaving everyone stunned. A red handprint appeared on Ace's face.


Amelia glared at him, unafraid. "You jerk who only bullies women,go back to where you came from!"

She had no one to rely on now; she couldn't back down!

Ace's face twisted with anger. He raised his hand, ready to hit her.

Amelia lifted her chin, fearless, as if indicating, "Go ahead, hit me if you dare."


Her hand was clenched in her sleeve, cold sweat dripping, but she looked inexplicably strong.

Maybe her gaze was too intense, and Ace hesitated, his hand frozen in mid-air.


She was Chris's wife, after all. Even if Chris wanted a divorce, Amelia would still be his ex-wife. He had to think about Chris. They had been nasty before, but it was all talk; they never dared to actually hit her.

"Ace, hit her! This woman is too much!"

"Yeah,how dare a lowly woman like her slap you?"

"Ace, if you don't hit her, I will."

Ace's face darkened as he yelled, "Everyone, get out!"
Then, he stepped closer, gritting his teeth. "Amelia, just you wait. I'll remember this slap."

"You did it for Leila, didn't you?" Amelia smiled faintly,her expression indifferent. "But don't you know that the person you like is head over heels for Chris?"

"That's nonsense!" Ace growled.

Amelia crossed her arms, "Leila neither initiates nor rejects you. She keeps stringing you along without responding, all the while openly professing her love for Chris. Then, with just the slightest hint, you get all worked up and keep harassing me because of her. Aren't you being incredibly foolish?"

Ace was stunned. "You..."

His eyes widened, realizing for the first time how sharp-tongued Amelia could be.


Amelia shot back, "You do realize I'm just the so-called Mrs.Spencer,right?I don't have any real power or Chris's heart. And you can't control Leila either. You're just another guy chasing after her."

She felt a sudden rush of satisfaction, like she finally got to vent her anger.


She used to be terrified of these people because no one had her back.Out in the world, anyone in their circle could insult her without facing any consequences.


She never dared to fight back because she didn't want to cause trouble for Chris. She always felt like their marriage was a debt she owed him. Since she loved him so much, she was willing to endure all the insults quietly.But the more she put up with it, the more they looked down on her.
Now, she was divorced. She wasn't afraid of being bullied ouside or humilated by the Spencer family. Giving up the title of Chris's wife, she realized she could stand up for herself. Over the years, she had even picked up some of Chris's intimidating mannerisms, which scaredI this group of people.

"Amelia!" Ace was fuming. "If you say another word, TIl personally..."

Before he could finish, Amelia pulled out her phone from behind her back;it was recording.

"Go on," she said calmly. "You can stay quiet, but anything you say will be used against you in this circle."

Ace gritted his teeth, glaring at her with pure hatred and frustration.

It wasn't until the cab arrived that Amelia finally relaxed. Once she got into the car, tears streamed down her face.

She felt a sense of survive,like she had narrowly escaped a disaster.

But she didn't notice a car parked quietly by the roadside.


Shawn rolled down the window after seeing the enraged Ace punch his own car twice and drive off in anger.


To be honest, he wasn't surprised. The sharp-tongued, fierce Amelia he had just seen was someone he had encountered more than once before because that was her true self. The weak person who had been bullied a few days ago was probably just her after losing herself over the years.Amelia was supposed to be strong.

Shawn took out a photo pieced together from two separate images,carefully caressing it.
In the photo, there was a boyand a girl standing side by side. At first glance, there was nothing unusual, but upon closer inspection, it was clear that the figures had been cut out from different places. The two people were from a graduation group photo; one 'was him, and the other was Amelia.

"All these years, we don't even have a single photo together. What a pity,"he murmured to himself, his thoughts drifting back to their student days as he gazed out the car window.




"You just stood up to Ace?" Hearing about Amelia's recent experience,Sophia was both shocked and scared. "Aren't you afraid he'll come after you again?"


Amelia waved her hand. "I can't worry about that now. Besides,I have nothing to lose. If he has the guts, we can both go down together."

Sophia sighed deeply, her heart aching. "What kind of fate is this,forcing someone as gentle as you into such a state?"


Amelia gave a bitter smile. At least this way, she wouldn't be at the mercy of others anymore.


"What should we do next? Tomorrow is the final deadline," Sophia muttered to herself. "Why didn't you take a few pieces of jewelry that could be sold when you divorced? All you took were a few paintings,and they can't be sold."

Hearing about the paintings, Amelia's eyes lit up. "Yes, I brought several paintings with me!"

Back in college, Nina always took the living expenses Paxton sent her. At
that time, she, an art student, had gained the admiration of her mentor,then she was allowed to display her works in an art exhibition and sold them at a good price.
###Chapter 10

Amelia found out the box she had brought along and opened it, revealing a bunch of carefully framed paintings.

Seeing those paintings, Amelia went quiet.

"Why are all your paintings of Chris?" Sophia asked, eyebrows raised in surprise.

Amelia plopped down on the sofa, frustrated.

How stupid she had been. When she left Spencer Villa, she thought these paintings were priceless and non-replaceable. They were all portraits of Chris. Not that anyone would dare to buy them, but even if they did, Chris would definitely notice and might accuse her of something.

"I think this one could work," Sophia said, picking up a painting of a back view. "You can't really tell who it is from this."

Amelia felt a flicker of hope and looked over. This painting was different.showing only a cold, stern back.

"That's it," Amelia said. She contacted a,high-end gallery anonymously,quickly negotiated the terms, and arranged for a courier to transport the painting.


To her surprise, less than an hour later, the gallery called to inform her that the painting had already been sold.

Amelia's voice shook. "How much did it sell for?"

The staff was cheerful and couldn't hide their excitement. "Five million dollars. Ms. Tudor, you're a genius. This is the highest-priced painting we'
ve ever sold since our gallery opened. Do you have any other paintings?"

Amelia was about to say no, but then she thought she could keep painting.She had studied art since she was a kid; she never planned to make a living from it, but now she had no choice.

She said softly, "Yes, but it'll take some time."

The next morning, the gallery took their cut, and $2.5 million was transferred to her account.

With that,Amelia went straight to the hospital, paid off all of Paxton's expenses in one go, and transferred him to a hospital she had arranged in advance, hiring a caregiver to look after him.

After doing all this, she felt a huge weight lift off her chest, leaving her feeling completely at ease. Maybe it was because she felt less indebted to Chris.


Ever since she decided to divorce, she didn't want to owe Chris any favors.The two billion dollars Nina swindled at the wedding was impossible for her to repay in this lifetime, so she could only try to compensate him as much as possible.


Meanwhile, at a private golf course in the suburbs, Chris swung his club hard, and the white ball shot out, making several arcs in the air before disappearing into the distance.


A waiter brought over a drink, but he waved him away impatiently, sitting down on a lounge chair and glancing at his phone.

He received nothing but a number of junk messages. A strange sense of irritation crossed Chris's chest. What was he expecting?
"Chris, there you are. I've been looking for you everywhere," a sweet voice called out. Chris instinctively turned his head, seeing Leila elegantly walking over in high heels.

"Look what I got," Leila said, showing him a painting like it was a treasure. "I bought this painting while shopping last night. I think the person in the painting looks a lot like you, and the artist's talent is incredible. They handled the light and shadow effects so well,and look..."

Before she could finish, Chris's indifferent gaze suddenly changed.

He stood up, snatched the painting, and stared at it intently, as if trying to see through the painting and its artist.

"What's wrong?" Leila was startled by his sudden action, puzzled. "Chris,why are you..."

Before she could finish, he had already turned coldly and quickly walked towards his car.

On the other side, Amelia and Sophia had just finished dinner and were leisurely walking along the street.

Amelia had been living under immense pressure lately, with few moments of such leisure; a gentle smile perpetually graced her lips.

"Amelia, what are your plans next?" Sophia asked.

Lowering her eyes in contemplation for a moment, Amelia said, "I have signed a one-year contract with Sapphire. If I leave now, I would have to pay triple the penalty fee. Therefore, I must work there this year. I plan to use this time to nurse my father's health back to good condition and deal with future matters later."
She pressed her lips together, not wanting to think about why the mention of leaving made her feel empty inside.

"Aren't you afraid that your mom will come after you again? If she finds out you divorced Chris, she will go crazy." Sophia looked worried.

Amelia's expression was firm. "I can't back down anymore, and I can't be controlled by fear. I have my own life."

She looked up at the sky, just in time to see two birds flying into the horizon, chirping excitedly.

Suddenly, a black sports car stopped in front of them, the screeching brakes deafening.


Amelia was startled. Looking closely, she saw the handsome face and deep brown eyes of the man through the car window.

Chris? She didn't have timę to think,grabbed Sophia, and turned to run.

Sophia panted. "Didn't you say you weren't afraid of him anymore?"

"It's different; his appearance surely spells trouble." Amelia movedI toward a flower shop by the roadside, intending to shake off Chris.

The next second, a large hand grabbed her by the back of her neck,holding her in place.


Amelia's body stiffened. After being controlled by this invisible suffocating feeling for three years, she couldn't even react to escape. She stood frozen,like a lifeless puppet.

Sophia turned back and saw Chris easily holding Amelia. Their size difference was too great; Amelia even had no chance of fighting back, let
alone escaping.

"You go first." Amelia finally regained her composure and urgently said to her in a low voice.

Sophia clenched her teeth, then turned and ran to seek assistance.

"Where did you intend to run?" Chris's cold, hoarse voice came.

The strength of his grip made Amelia uncomfortable, and the heat from his touch made her body tremble.

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to calm her racing heart, and said coldly,"None of your business."


As soon as she spoke, Chris had already turned her head towards him.

Their eyes met, and Chris's stern face was terrifying, his deep eyes filled with cold fury.


Amelia's heart trembled, instinctively wanting to retreat, but she forced herself to look at him calmly.


"Got some guts now? Speak!" Chris's patience was exhausted.He grabbed her by the back of her neck and dragged her towards his car.

Amelia shouted, "Let go of me, you lunatic. What are you doing?"


Amelia was a bit scared. Where was he taking her? Chris was truly out of his mind. In broad daylight, wasn't he afraid of being photographed and criticized for his actions?


Chris sneered and opened the car door, throwing her into the passenger seat.
Although Amelia was tall, she was slender. Curled up in the passenger seat,she appeared pitiable, yet her eyes burned with a fierce intensity as she glared at him.

Chris was suddenly amused by her look, his hand pausing for a moment as he closed the door.

In that moment, Amelia quickly opened the car door to run.
###Chapter 11

Chris had hit his limit and snapped, "If you don't want your dad to die,get back here!"

Amelia froze. She had moved Paxton to another hospital, but she knew Chris's power. If he wanted to find someone, it was only a matter of time.

Panic set in. She turned, biting her lip. "What do you want? I've paid the hospital bills. I don't owe you anything."

"Do you?" Chris's voice was icy. "If you can sell yourself, why not work harder and pay back the two billion dollars the Tudor family owes me?"

Sell? This words incated strong humuliation. Amelia's eyes welled up,cutting off his cruel words. "It wasn't me. I've told you many times. Why do you always target me? Is it because I married you that I became your punching bag?"


Her eyes, red and desperate, only seemed to amuse Chris more.He watched her, something unfamiliar stirring inside him. His deep eyes held unreadable emotions, making Amelia hesitate. She regretted her words immediately. What power did she have against Chris? He could crush her like an ant.

Her face went pale, bracing for his wrath.

But Chris didn't explode. He just sneered, "Sharp-tongued."

He walked over, his presence overwhelming. "When did you get so bold?In just a few days without me, you've changed a lot."

"What do you want?" Amelia's voice trembled. "Don't tell me you've fallen in love with me and can't bear to divorce."
Chris laughed coldly, "Ridiculous. How could I love a self-degrading and vile woman like you?"

She had even sold his portrat. Was she that desperate for money?


His cold eyes and disdainful look seemed to say, "Do you even deserve it?"

Amelia's heart ached. She knew Chris could never love her, but hearing it still hurt.

"Then stay away from me. I just want to get through this thirty-day cooling-off period, and then we're done." She turned to leave.

Chris thought, 'She owes me two billion and so many promises. How dare she say we're done??

His face darkened, but he let her go, watching her walk away.

Chris held back his anger, thinking, 'When did I become so lenient,letting her act like this?'


At an intersection, Amelia saw Sophia rushing over with a group of helpers.

"Amelia, are you okay? Did he hurt you?" Sophia asked, checking her over.

"I'm fine. Chris isn't that violent," Amelia said.


Sophia gave her a skeptical look, "Only you think that. Everyone in Pinecrest knows his violent reputation. His mood swings are crazy, and he often has people's arms and legs broken."

"Those are just rumors," Amelia paused a second and said.

"I know you're lovesick, seeing him differently," Sophia rolled her eyes
and dismissed the group.

On the way back, Sophia suddenly said, "Maybe Chris likes you but doesn't know how to show it, or maybe he doesn't even realize it."

"Impossible," Amelia said quickly, ruffling Sophia's hair. "What are you thinking? That's ridiculous."

Sophia was puzzled. "Everyone knows Chris's violent nature. Those who cross him never have a good ending. There are so many ways to punish you.Why did he waste three years not divorcing you?"

Amelia smiled bitterly. "Now he thinks the punishment is enough, and with his favorite person back, he's agreed to divorce me."

Emotional pain was way worse than any physical harm. Chris knew she loved him, so he chose to hurt her this way, making her beg for his affection with a sliver of hope.

Later, Amelia called Paxton and found out he was still in the hospital,safe and sound. No strange people around. She felt relieved and told him to take care and avoid contacting other family members, especially Nina,the troublemaker.


Time flew by. Amelia had been working at Sapphire for more than half a month, with only ten days left in the divorce period.

To show her gratitude to Sapphire, she gave her all in every performance.

Shawn would drop by sometimes, and they got along well. Amelia knew he was into racing now, totally obsessed, even though his family had tried to stop him multiple times.

He'd occasionally mention Lucius. Lucius was a mystery,even more so
than she thought. He looked friendly and elegant, but no one dared to cross him.

Amelia's life was peaceful now, like the past was just a bad dream. She forgot the pain and no longer had those boutsof temporary blindness.

But today, that peace was shattered.

In the afternoon, after finishing work, Gary pulled her aside, asking her to do an extra performance. The pay was double, but it was for a private room guest.


Amelia could tell Gary wanted her to agree. This guest must be someone important.

"Okay, I'll go change," she said.


After changing, Gary led her to a fancy private room on the fourth floor."This is it. I'll check the situation first. If needed, you can go in later."

Amelia nodded, curious about his caution. Soon, Gary came out and signaled her to go in.


He suddenly grabbed her arm and whispered, "Be careful not to anger the guest."

Amelia knew the customer was always right. But when she stepped into the room and saw who was inside, she regreted it.


"Mr. Spencer, isn't this your ex-wife, Ms. Tudor? Someone said she was playing the piano here, and we didn't believe it. What a surprise." Ace had a nasty grin as he stood up, eyeing Amelia's dress with disdain.

But the more he looked, the more beautiful he found her. Amelia looked
thin, but she had a great figure, with curves in all the right places. The mermaid dress she wore made her look stunning. Her clear makeup highlighted her beauty, making her even more dazzling.

The once timid Amelia now stood there with a bright and elegant charm,surprising everyone.

"Ace, come back. Don't scare Miss Tudor." Leila spoke,glancing thoughtfully at Chris beside her.

The painting she bought for five million dollars was taken by Chris,and then his secretary contacted her, giving her six million dollars. Such a strange thing made Leila suspicious, so she investigated and found out the painting was actually done by Amelia.

Leila felt less confident around Chris. She wanted to see how important Amelia was to him.


"You underestimate Miss Tudor. She's a star here, earning high tips. Not just anyone can compare." Ace laughed, glancing at Chris sitting on the sofa.


Seeing Chris calmly holding his glass, Ace took it as approval and got bolder. He picked up a snack from the table and threw it at Amelia. "Hey,we're all friends here. Play us a song for free."

Everyone watched,amused.


Amelia calmly brushed off the crumbs. "Sure, sir, what would you like to hear?"


"So generous, selling yourself for free?" Ace's words made everyone laugh mockingly.
Amelia's face darkened.
###Chapter 12

"Buying and selling are both dirty business," Amelia sneered. "You guys are all big shots, right? Shouldn't you know how to respect other people's jobs? Or are you just all flash and no substance?"

Leila chimed in, "Miss Tudor, you're overreacting. Ace was just kidding around. Why are you taking it so seriously?"

Leila gave a faint smile, trying to look all high and mighty.

Ace crossed his arms, raised an eyebrow, and looked like he owned the place.

Leila,acting like she was in charge, said softly, "Amelia, just apologize to Ace, and we can move on. Chris is here too; you don't want to upset him,do you?"

But Amelia just stared at her, calm but with a fire in her eyes.

Chris suddenly burst out with a sneer, which made everyone else go quiet.

The atmosphere in the room was extremely weird. And Leila looked pretty embarrassed.


Leila's face fell, and she glanced at Chris, hoping he'd step in.

But Chris just sat there, swirling his drink, like he hadn't sneered at al1.He was just watching, not getting involved.

Leila's face darkened. What was Chris playing at? Was he actually into that bitch Amelia? Amelia's sharp gaze was still locked on Leila,making her squirm.
"Are we gonna play or not?" Chris's deep voice cut through the tension.

He looked up,giving Amelia a cold, dismissive glance.

Leila relaxed a bit. At least Chris still seemed to hate Amelia.

"A waitress with an attitude? Get over yourself. Play the piano, or you won't be leaving here. I'll report you and get you fired," Ace scolded,pointing right at Amelia.

Amelia clenched her fists, glanced at Chris, who was just letting them mock her, and her eyes dimmed. She walked over to the piano and sat down.


Sapphire Music Restaurant had a set playlist to match the vibe, so Amelia started playing a piece called "Starry Sky."

With her back to the crowd, the music flowed, pure and sweet, like it was taking everyone under a vast, starry sky, creating a magical, romantic scene.

At first, everyone thought it was a joke. No one had seen Amelia play in years,and they figured she could only manage something basic like "Ode to Joy." They were ready to laugh at her.

But her playing was beautiful, surprising everyone.

Her neck was long and elegant, her dress showing off her graceful back,
and her fingers danced over the keys like they were part of the music.

Leila and Ace were the most shocked, staring at Amelia's back viciously.

When the piece ended, the room was oddly silent; no one clapped.

Amelia stood up and bowed, following the rules.
"Get out," Chris suddenly commanded, his voice cutting through the tension.

"Did you hear that? Mr. Spencer told you to get lost. Your playing sucks,"Ace barked, his tone grating and obnoxious.

Amelia felt a wave of relief and started to leave.

Leila, secretly pleased, threw a concerned look at Chris. "Chris, Miss Tudor is still an employee here. If she gets kicked out like this, she might get punished. Maybe we should..."

One was making things hard for her, the other pretending to care. What a perfect pair! Amelia thought, but she didn't care.

Just as she reached the door, Chris's cold voice stopped her, "Hold on!Did I say you1 could leave?"

Amelia froze.

Everyone else looked confused, especially Leila, who was taken aback.

If Chris didn't want Amelia to leave, did that mean he wanted them to go?

Ace looked at Chris, puzzled, but Chris's icy glare shut him up.

Two people stood up first and quickly walked out, followed by the others,not wanting to risk Chris's wrath by lingering.


Leila stayed behind, "Chris, let Miss Tudor go. She's just doing her job out of necessity."

"Get out," Chris ordered, not even glancing at her.

Leila was stunned, her eyes filled with reluctance. "Chris,you can't..."
"How many times do you need me to repeat?" Chris's patience was wearing thin.

Leila's eyes reddened, but she stood up obeidently. As she passed Amelia,her gaze turned sharp.

"Any other orders, Mr. Spencer?" Amelia forced a smile.

Chris looked at her with a cold, unyielding stare, making her heart race and her palms sweat.

Then he looked away, a cold smile on his lips. He sneered, "You just divorced me and you're already out here trying to seduce men? Are you that horny; you can't go a day without a man?"

Amelia's face went pale, but she said nothing.

Today she was a waitress; he was a customer. She couldn't afford to offend him.


Her silence only made him angrier. Chris asked, "Cat got your tongue?"

Amelia kept her head down, staring at her high heels.

These shoes were picked by the stylist at the last minute. They fit, but the heels were thin and high, making it hard for her to stand steadily.

"Speak!" Chris suddenly exploded, taking three steps forward and grabbing her shoulder, pulling her back.


Amelia's whole body lurched forward with the unexpected force,nearly causing her to fall to the ground. She quickly grabbed the piano keys,making a discordant sound, like her chaotic heartbeat.

"What exactly do you want?" She shook him off, gritting her teeth."
Bringing them here tomock me; is that fun for you?"

She had never lost her temper in front of him like this before, feeling cornered. It wasn't very aggressive, even a bit ridiculous, but it was also somewhat refreshing. Suddenly, the inexplicable anger in his heart dissipated.


Chris arched an eyebrow, his gaze inscrutable as he looked into her eyes."It was dull before, but now it intrigues me."

Suddenly, an impulse stirred within him as he gazed into her clear eyes.

Chris narrowed his eyes, hooking her neck. "I don't think I've ever kissed you before."
###Chapter 13

The next second. Chris leaned in and kissed Amelia. The moment their lips met, it felt like a jolt of electricity shot through her. Amelia's eyes flew open in shock. What was going on? Was he actually kissing her?

In her daze, his tongue slipped past her lips, tangling with hers, making it impossible to pull away.

Chris had always scoffed at the idea of kissing women. He never imagined Amelia's lips could be so addictive, one kiss making him lose all control.

Her eyes and lips were especially alluring today. When she played the piano, her untouchable , almost divine aloofness seemed to cast a spell on him,stirringsomething deep inside.

The room filled with the sound of heavy breathing, the heat rising between them.


Amelia was lost in the moment, her head spinning.She forgot to resist,her hands resting on Chris's broad chest, letting him take over.

When he lifted her onto the piano, the keys clanged discordantly. It wasn't until Chris started removing her evening gown and touched her breasts that she snapped back to reality.

What was he doing? This was a private room in a restaurant!

"Chris, let go of me; we're already divorced!" Amelia shouted.

Chris sneered. "Your vile body isn't saying that. It feels good, doesn't it?"

To humiliate her, his hand moved lower and felt a wet sensation.
Ashamed and furious, Amelia pushed Chris away, trying to jump off the piano.

But before she could, Chris grabbed her again, pressing her hard against the keys, causing another chaotic sound.

"Are you crazy?" Amelia struggled fiercely, but she couldn't push away the strong Chris, only making the piano beneath her produce more disordered notes.

"Yeah. I am crazy," Chris said.

Right now, he wanted this. He wanted to press her on the piano and make her look at him with those wet eyes.

Chris forcefully grabbed her hands, pinning them above her head, then lifted her chin with his other hand, forcing her to look at him.

"Do you know how eager you lookc right now? Like you can't wait for me to take you right here."

Amelia couldn't believe it. Would Chris say such words?

"Chris, piss off! You're shameless! Let go of me! Get away from me!"Amelia yelled.


Chris sneered, grabbing her waist tightly, inching closer. "You wouldn't make me leave, would you? You're so filthy and lewd, dressing like a slut to seduce men. Haven't you always wanted me to fuck you and get you pregnant? I'm giving you this cance,to satisfy you."

With a cold, mocking tone, he lowered his head and took her breast into his mouth,biting roughly.
The door to the private room wasn't locked; anyone could walk in at any moment.

Amelia felt utterly humiliated. She had once longed to be intimate with him, but now, she'd rather die than let it happen.

"Even if you are the only man in the world, I wouldn't want you to satisfy me!" Amelia snapped, clenching her teeth and closing her eyes in anger.

Chris lifted his head and sneered coldly, "Why pretend to be innocent?You've not only stripped and crept into my bed multiple times, but you've also secretly spiked my drink with aphrodisiac."

Amelia's body stiffened, unable to argue.

She had been so desperate, casting aside her dignity in a futile attempt to bear Chris'schild. But hadn't Chris never touched her? He always looked at her with disgust, as if she were a filthy prostitute. Why this time...

"I was wrong..." she trembled, crying out, "I was wrong. I shouldn't have liked you. I already..."

She no longer dared to like him.

"You liked me?" Chris asked.

Amelia continued to cry, her pitiful appearance inexplicably attractive,arousing his desire again.

Chris irritably wiped her tears. "Stop crying!"

"Chris, what are you doing?" Suddenly, a clear male voice came from the doorway.

It was Lucius. Amelia's heart tightened. She couldn't be seen like this. But
she was also relieved that someone had come to stop Chris. Chris's face darkened as he shielded Amelia's exposed skin, helping her straighten her clothes.

Lucius entered slowly, emanating an aura that was impossible to overlook.

Once her clothes were back in place, Amelia shoved Chris away and quickly ran behind Lucius.

"Mr. Howard..." her voice trembled, a hint of plead in it.

Lucius took one look at the sullen Chris and instantly got the picture.He smiled reassuringly at Amelia, his gaze soft and comforting.

Seeing this, Chris's expression grewv even colder, his eyes locked on Amelia hiding behind Lucius.

"Chris, what's going on?" Lucius's voice was calm but carried a touch of authority.


As an elder, he had the right to stand up to Chris.

Chris's tone was mocking, "What does it have to do with you?"


Lucius didn't get angry. "Since you're divorced, stop pestering her.You should be more understanding."

Chris sneered,"I show you some respect, and you even start acting up."

His voice wasn't loud, but it carried a sense of pressure.

"You go out first," Lucius turned to Amelia. "Don't worry; he won't stop you."

Amelia nodded,still scared,and left.
"Lucius, you have no right to make decisions for me," Chris snarled.

Lucius glanced at him indifferently, "Your grandfather once asked me to keep an eye on you before he left, especially to make sure you don't bully Amelia."




The group had already left, leaving only Leila and Ace in the dining hall.clearly with something to say.

Seeing Amelia come out with a strange expression, Leila's eyes immediately burning with intense anger.. She almost lost her composure as she questioned, "WWhat's going on with you?"

Amelia's tears and the hickeys on her neck told her that something suggestive had happened in the private room.

Amelia ignored them, planning to go straight to change clothes.

But Leila followed her all-the way to the changing room and asked, "What did Chris say to you?"

"Are you curious?" Amelia smiled faintly, "Then why don't you ask him;aren't you close to him? If you ask him, he will surely tell you everything.So why bother questioning me."

Leila's shoulders trembled with anger, "You bitch, you..."

"Ms. Ross, be careful with your words." Amelia pointed to the camera in the corner of the room, "Someone is watching your every move. I'd like to see what kind of reaction it would cause if a big star was exposed for bullying a waitress,"
"Well, it turns out you've been pretending to be weak and timid all along."Leila was exasperated. "But it clearly didn't work. You pretended for three years, and Chris never looked at you even once." She smiled mockingly.

Amelia turned and sat down in front of the makeup mirror, speaking deliberately and calmly. "So I've changed my strategy, planning to play hard to get. Ms. Ross, instead of arguing with me, you should focus on ensuring Chris's loyalty to you. Lest he be enticed away by someone else one day."

In the mirror, Leila's face changed expressions, looking very unpleasant.She left with a livid face.

Ace hurriedly came up. "How did it go? Did you find out anything;do you need my help?"

Looking at the worried face in front of her, Leila felt a wave of disgust. If only it were Chris who was concerned about her at this moment.

"Nothing, I'm leaving," she said coldly.

Ace took out his car keys, "Ill drive you back; it's quite far from here to your place."

"No need!" Leila's voice suddenly rose, attracting the attention of those around her. She then lowered her voice, "Ace, I'm going to be busy with a show recently; you should go take care of your own business."

With that,she left.


Ace looked puzzled. What was going on? It must be that bitch Amelia who said something; he wouldn't let her off!

Amelia changed her clothes, feeling heavy-hearted. This was probably her
last time working here. Even though the restaurant owner was Lucius,Chris would never let her stay here.

In her memory, Lucius had always disdained getting involved in any of the Spencer family's affairs. For the past few years, he had turned a blind eye to all the humiliations she suffered. Why did he extend a helping hand now? Was it because he hated people causing trouble in his place?Or was there some other reason she didn't know?

As Amelia walked out, lost in thought, a deep male voice called from behind. "Miss Tudor, please wait."
###Chapter 14

Amelia turned her head and locked eyes with Lucius, his deep gaze peeking out from behind his glasses.

"Mr. Howard, do you need something?" she asked, her tone icy. Then it hit her-he'd saved her today. She owed him a thank you. Bowing slightly,she said, "Thanks a lot, Mr. Howard. I really appreciate it."

As she bent over, her hair fell forward, carrying a faint scent.

Lucius's brow furrowed a bit, a strange emotion flickering in his eyes, but he quickly masked it.

"It was nothing," he said with a slight smile. "Besides, Chris was being a jerk. As his uncle, it's my job to keep him in check."

Amelia felt a warmth spread through her chest and smiled genuinely. "Still.I have to thank you."

Lucius didn't respond directly but said, "Miss Tudor, someone as kind as you deserves better than Chris."


Amelia didn't quite get what he meant and figured he was just being polite.

The Spencer family was always a mystery, especially Lucius. Amelia thought it best to keep her distance.

As she went out, a mocking voice filled with hostility came from behind her.


"When did you start cozying up to Lucius?"

She didn't need to turn around to know it was Chris.
Amelia thought. 'Damn, doesn't he have a job? Why is he always around?'

She ignored him and kept walking.

"Believe it or not, I'll teardown this restaurant." Chris's impatient voice was full of threats.

Amelia found it amusing. "If you tear down this restaurant,you'll probably have to pay a ton in damages, and you might not even have the authority to do it." She turned to look at him.

The warm yellow streetlight bathed her, turning her hair golden and making her seem to glow.

Chris's anger faded a lot. He sneered coldly; Amelia was still so naive.Money and power were easy for him.

He took a steptowards her,his tall figure looming.

Amelia instinctively stepped back, her eyes wary. "What do you want?This is a public place, with people everywhere. Be careful not to get caught on camera."


Ever since signing the divorce papers, her fear of Chris had lessened a lot.

"I was asking you!" Chris grabbed her shoulder, forcing her to look into his eyes. "Answer me!"


Amelia mocked herself, "Cozying up to Lucius? You're giving me too much credit."


Chris raised an eyebrow, seemingly finding it reasonable.

"But why did he praise you?"he asked through gritted teeth.
Amelia shrugged, "Ask him. How would I know his thoughts? Maybe I deserve praise, or maybe he just praises everyone."

As she spoke, she scanned for an escape route. How could she stay with someone who tried to assault her earlier? She had to calm him down first and then make a run for it!

"Trying to run?" Chris stared at her coldly. "Amelia, you're getting bolder...



Before he could finish, Amelia had already squatted down and bolted,disappearing in no time.

There were plenty of buildings around, and she could easily lose him by ducking through a few alleys.

"Damn it!" Chris punched the wall hard.




"Chris, I made you a late-night snack. It's soup I whipped up myself.Want to give it a try?" Leila emerged from the kitchen, holding a steaming bowl of soup, her hairtied up casually. Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.

Chris glanced at her, his tone sharp. "What are you doing here?"

This was the house he and Amelia had lived in after their marriage. After Amelia left, it was just him and Zola, and it was unusually quiet.

Leila's eyes flickered slightly. "I... so much happened today; you must be in a bad mood. I wanted to come..."


"No need," Chris's mind drifted back to what had happened at Lucius's place earlier and inexplicably thought of Amelia's escaping figure.
His mood soured. She used to chase after him, and he couldn't shake her off,but now...

"Chris, don't be like this." Leila's voice softened, pleading, "I spent a long time cooking this. At least try a bite, okay?"

She took two steps forward, holding the bowl out to him, her eyes blinking.
Today, she had taken special care with her makeup, appearing exceptionally captivating and alluring.

She had even practiced her smile in front of the mirror for hours. She believed that whenever she smiled like that, countless men would fal for her.


"Take it away." He refused bluntly, waving his hand. "Don't come here again. This is not a place you should be."

Accompanied by the sound of the bowl falling to the ground, Leila let out a fragile cry. Her delicate calf was scalded by the soup, and she covered it with her hand.


Chris,with his back to her, was somewhat impatient but still called for Zola. "Take her out. From now on, no one is allowed in without my permission."


Leila was suddenly shocked. How come?

"Chris, I'm in pain. Don't do this..." She hurriedly grabbed his pant leg.looking at him with hopeful and helpless eyes, which seemed like no men would refuse.


Chris indeed turned to look at her, his gaze deepening.

Leila's heartbeat raced with joy. Great, it worked! She even squeezed out
tears, looking so pitiful. As long as he slowly helped her up,she could fall into his arms.

"Whose apron are you wearing?" Chris stared directly at her upper body.

"Take it off!" Before she could answer, he had already ordered coldly.

His voice was unusually cold. Leila was startled.

This apron was something she had casually taken from the kitchen. It had a sunflower print on it, as if someone had drawn it. It was very ugly, but she hadn't minded. Could it be...

Leila's face turned pale, looking at Chris in disbelief.

Chris snapped, "Taking other people's things without permission,Leila,you have such good manners." Chris sneered coldly.

"Ms. Ross, please take off the apron," Zola reminded softly.


"But it's just an apron, Chris. What do you mean?" Leila was completely broken, her voice hoarse. At this moment, she still couldn't believe her terrible suspicion.


"It was hand-painted by Mrs. Spencer herself, and it's her favorite apron.Please take it off," Zola's voice was very urgent, almost wanting to take it off herself.


Zola thought, 'Couldn't she see that Chris is already angry?


Leila's face was twisted. She took two steps back, almost slipping on the soup on the floor.

She sneered and looked up at Chris, "So, you still can't let-go of that woman?"
###Chapter 15
Chris's face turned stormy. "Leave us," he commanded, his voice echoing in the vast living room.
Without another word, he headed upstairs. The icy tension that had gripped the space began to dissipate, but Leila remained where she stood, her expression frozen.
"Ms. Ross, it’s time to go," Zola said, her tone professional but unmistakably distant.
Leila watched Chris’s retreating figure, a flicker of cold calculation in her eyes. She couldn't understand how Amelia, a woman she viewed as a mere shadow from Chris’s past, could still occupy any space in his mind.
The next morning, Amelia arrived at the restaurant with a knot of anxiety in her stomach. To her surprise, there was no termination notice waiting for her. Her coworkers treated her with the same casual indifference as always.
During the morning meeting, Gary announced a prestigious assignment: Lucius’s upcoming birthday gala. All performers were required to spend two hours a day rehearsing a piano and violin duet titled "River of Your Heart." Amelia accepted the news quietly; she was used to her schedule being dictated by others.
As the days passed, the one-month cooling-off period for the divorce was nearing its end. This was the final step toward the freedom she had craved for three years.
[Amelia: I’ll meet you at City Hall tomorrow at 8 AM. Please be punctual.]
She sent three messages to Chris. Each went unread. When she finally tried to call, the phone rang until it timed out. She wasn't blocked, but she was being systematically ignored.
"What is he doing?" Amelia whispered, a sense of dread pooling in her chest.
According to the law, if one party failed to appear at the end of the waiting period, the application would be automatically withdrawn. To push it further, she would have to initiate a long, messy litigation—something she desperately wanted to avoid. She assumed Chris would be just as eager to finalize the split so he could move on with Leila, but his silence was unnerving.
The next morning, Amelia arrived at City Hall before the doors even opened.
Hidden in plain sight across the street, Chris sat in the back of a black Maybach. He watched her through the tinted glass, observing her pacing the steps with an intensity that bordered on frantic. She looked more eager to end the marriage than most couples were to start one, and the sight of it sparked a sharp, inexplicable irritation in him.
When Amelia ran down the steps to scan the arriving cars, Chris signaled his driver to reverse, keeping the vehicle just out of her line of sight.
Her message flashed on his screen: [Chris, it’s noon. Are you really going to break your word?]
He could almost see the fire in her eyes as she typed those words. The submissive, quiet woman he had known for three years was gone, replaced by someone who finally dared to challenge him. He turned off the phone and stared out the window as the hours ticked by.
By the time City Hall closed for the day, the staff gently informed Amelia that her application had been dismissed due to the absence of her spouse.
"He must have changed his mind, dear," one clerk said kindly. "A man doesn't miss a divorce appointment unless he’s realized what he’s losing."
Amelia let out a bitter laugh. He hasn't realized what he's losing; he's just realized how much he enjoys the hunt, she thought.
Just as she reached her car, her phone rang. It was Chris.
"I hear you’ve been looking for me," he said. His voice was strangely smooth, lacking its usual jagged edge.
"Chris, you gave me your word," Amelia snapped, her voice shaking with suppressed fury. "We were supposed to end this today. Use your influence, call whoever you need to call, and finalize the paperwork right now."
There was a pause. "I thought the appointment was scheduled for tomorrow," he said, his tone dripping with a feigned innocence that made her skin crawl.
"You know exactly when it was," she countered, gritting her teeth. "Stop playing games. Tell me when you're going to show up, and I'll be there."
Instead of answering, Chris initiated a video call. Amelia answered immediately, her eyes red from a day of waiting in the cold. "What do you want, Chris?"
Seeing her like this—stubborn, exhausted, and finally showing real emotion—felt strangely refreshing to him. The "Amelia" of the past had been a ghost in his house, someone who lived in the shadows and spoke in whispers. This version of her had a spark that he found impossible to look away from.
"You think you can dictate the terms of our separation?" Chris raised an eyebrow, a smug look crossing his face. "You’re forgeting who holds the power in this arrangement."
"You signed the agreement, Chris. You promised."
"An agreement is just a piece of paper until the law recognizes it," he replied coolly. "Wait for my notice. I’ll decide when we’re finished."
He hung up, leaving Amelia staring at a black screen.
She had no choice but to endure. With Lucius’s gala approaching, she poured her frustration into her music, though her rehearsals were often interrupted by her wandering thoughts. Gary, the restaurant manager, noticed her distraction and pulled her aside twice.
"Amelia, this gala is a massive opportunity. Don't let it slip through your fingers," he urged.
"I understand, Gary. I won't fail," she promised.
Gary gave her an enigmatic look before leaving. "I have high expectations for you, Amelia. Don't disappoint me."
Soon, the final rehearsal arrived. That afternoon, the performance attire was delivered. While the other musicians received elegant but understated black and gold gowns, Amelia opened her garment bag to find something entirely different—a dress that seemed designed to ensure she wouldn't stay in the shadows for long.

###Chapter 16

When they pulled ouat the dress, everyone was totally shocked.

This gown wasn't just a different color; it was on a whole other level with its design, cut, and the fancy pearls and silk decorations. One could tell right away it was the star of the show. But during rehearsals,there were no special roles.

"Mr. Barnes, is there some mix-up with Amelia's dress and headpiece?
They look nothing like ours," violinist Anna Rivera asked, confused.

"Yeah,her dress is a completely different style from ours."

"Did they make it just for her?"

People started chiming in, and soon everyone wasdiscussing loudly.

Amelia's'cheeks turned a bit red as she quietly asked, "Mr. Barnes, whať's going on here?"


She suddenly remembered Gary mentioning a few days ago that he had different plans for her. "Mind your own business! What's with all the questions? Go change and put on your makeup. Anyone with objections can leave right now!" Gary's blunt words shut everyone up.

Amelia headed to the dressing room, but she could feel everyone staring at her differently.


"Look, it's our leading player. She showed up last and was the least serious during rehearsals, yet she gets special treatment," Anna's jealous voice cut through the room, sparking more gossip.

"Amelia, how did you snag the main role? Spil1. Anna's always been the
lead with her experience. Why you this time?" Another woman,usually Anna's sidekick, asked with a mocking grin.

But Amelia was just as clueless.

"If you have questions, ask Mr. Barnes. I only found out when I got the dress," Amelia said coolly and went to change.

Anna shot her a nasty look and signaled to her sidekick, who followed Amelia into the next dressing room.

The two dressing rooms were only separated by a curtain. Amelia quickly swapped her own dress for the fancy gown. It fit perfectly,hugging her curves and making her look super elegant and graceful.

Then, Gary brought in a special makeup artist to match her makeup with the dress, which looked like a piece of art.

Staring at herself in the mirror, Amelia felt like a different person. Usually,she did her own simple makeup for a fresh look, but today was a total 180.

Her perfectly shaped eyebrows and eyeshadow, paired with bold and eye-catching lipstick, along with the intricate hair accessories, made her look both classic and stunningly dignified. She even had a bit of an untouchable and distant vibe.


What Amelia didn't expect was that Lucius's birthday party was at Sapphire, with a beautiful outdoor garden at the back of the restaurant.The staff had decked out the garden with gorgeous lights, and there was even a fireworks show planned for the end of the party.

Meanwhile, inside the banquet hall, Leila sat quietly in a corner,occasionally glancing at Chris, who was a few seats away from her.
Joining such an exclusive event was all thanks to her agent's hard work and connections. The studio went all out, dressing her in a pristine luxury brand evening gown, one of only five in the world. Her earrings,emerald necklace, and bracelet were all top-notch. But even with all that,she couldn't get Chris to look her way. He just sat there,sipping his drink,looking like he didn't belong, with this icy vibe around him.

She was head over heels for him, comnpletely stuck.

Her phone buzzed suddenly. Trying to keep her cool, Leila checked it and smiled.

When Amelia and the others showed up, the party was winding down.Lucius's assistant was handing out cake, and Lucius was at the head table,quietly swirling his wine.


For some reason, Amelia noticed Lucius right away. He was low-key,but his presence was impossible to ignore. Lucius surprisingly looked back at her.


Before she could look away, Lucius raised his glass slightly in her direction.

It wasn't a big gesture, but it caught everyone's attention.

Chris suddenly sat up straight, his cold eyes locking onto Amelia among the crowd. She was truly standing out, How dare she flirt with Lucius in front of everyone?


Leila noticed Amelia too and frowned. She gritted her teeth and shot Amelia several incredulous looks, 'Bitch Amelia's just playing the damn piano; why is she dressed so flashy? But never mind. The more attention she gets now, the more embarrassing it'll be for her later,' Leila thought.

Amelia stood gracefully on stage, meeting Chris's dark gaze. Seeing Leila,
all dolled up beside him, made her feel a bit down.

These days, he didn't have time because he was always with Leila,right?

She looked away, took a deep breath, and calmed down again.

Sitting at the piano, her beautiful fingers pressed the keys, and a melodious tune began to play.

The violinist and cellist joined in, and as the beautiful music filled the room,everyone quieted down, lost in the music.

But then, Amelia felt something was wrong. The left side of her waist was loosening, and she heard a strange tearing sound!

What was wrong? Amelia was stunned at once. Their performance was almost over, and they still needed to take a bow. She feared that once she bent over, the tear in her gown would be glaringly obvious, leading to a major embarrassment.


She couldn't bear the thought of ruining Lucius's birthday party and embarrassing the whole ensemble. What should she do?

She didn't know anyone here. She couldn't ask Lucius for help; Shawn wasn't here today. The only person she could turn to was...

Amelia looked at Chris, who was still sitting there lazily, with Leila close to him,smiling sweetly and talking to him. And Chris actually gave Leila a faint smile.


That smie stung Amelia's eyes, and she quickly looked away, feeling upset.So, Chris could smile like that. Leila was thrilled. Just as she was about to hold his hand to look more intimate, Chris stood up and walked towards the ensemble.
As he got closer, his gaze locked onto Amelia's waist; he noticed something was wrong.

"Having trouble?" Chris sneered softly.
###Chapter 17

Chris plopped back down, still wearing that same indifferent look.

"Chris, what just happened?" Leila leaned in, her scent faintly lingering in the air.

Chris's face stayed blank, and he didn't bother to answer her.

Right then, Lucius's assistant got up and draped a shawl over Amelia.

Crisis averted. Amelia let out a deep breath, her heart pounding.

"Miss Tudor, come with me," the assistant whispered,taking her hand and helping her up.

Amelia was super grateful and went along without a fuss, leading the crowd in a bow. Just as she was about to leave with the others, the assistant 'steered her towards Lucius.


Amelia felt a bit panicked, hesitating to ask.

"Please sit," the assistant led her right to Lucius's side.

Amelia was stunned and looked at Luciuš. He gave a slight nod, signaling her to sit down.


With everyone watching, Amelia nervously approached and slowly sat in a seat that wasn't hers.


Lucius spoke softly, "It's okay; don't worry."

Those words did calm Amelia down.

"Mr. Howard, thank you," she blinked, her blue eyes sparkling.
Lucius's gaze was hard to read as he quietly looked at her. It felt like he was looking through her eyes at someone else. Amelia couldn't quite put her finger on it; she was just confused. Plus, Lucius seemed a bit off.

Amelia smiled slightly, picked up the wine glass on the table, and whispered,"Mr. Howard, what's wrong? Everyone's looking at you."

At that moment, everyone was casting curious glances at Lucius, especially those who knew about Amelia and Chris's relationship.

How did Amelia and Lucius get involved?

Lucius quickly pulled himself together and shifted his gaze nonchalantly.


But his expression was somewhat different today if taking a close look."
Your look today is quite special," this time, Lucius didn't look at her.

Amelia felt something was off and finally got what Gary had been hinting at, feeling incredibly incredulous. Could it be that Lucius had some thoughts about her?


"I still prefer my usual makeup," she smiled faintly and mustered the courage to ask, "Mr. Howard,may I leave now?"

She was making it clear she had no other intentions.

Lucius gave her a complex look and signaled to the assistant, who immediately understood.


Amelia's sudden preferential treatment, followed by her swift exit,became a hot topic of gossip, causing quite a stir that didn't die down for a long time.


Amelia had no time to care about this and quickly went to the dressing
room.

At this moment, the other members of the band had not yet left. Seeing her return, Gary, brimming with excitement, grasped her hand and incessantly praised her, insisting that she was indeed exceptional.
Amelia didn't actually listen to him, she pulled off the shawl, revealing the tear at her left waist.

"Mr. Barnes, someone messed with my dress, almost making me a laughingstock and dragging everyone, including you, into it." Her voice was icy, and her words left everyone stunned.

"What? What happened?" Gary was shocked too,staring at the torn dress."Who did this? Own up now!"

Silence.

"Maybe she tore the fancy dress herself; it's her own fault," Anna said.

"Yeah, she's always messing up during rehearsals and making us work overtime. Tearing a dress is nothing for her," Anna's sidekick,Gemma Young,added.


Gary suddenly turned and glared at Gemma. "It was you, wasn't it?Gemma!"


"Mr. Barnes, you can't just accuse me like that. Why would I target her?Am I that malicious?" Gemma shot back loudly.


With the crisis averted and no cameras in the dressing room, she could deny it all she wanted.

"You're so stubborn and unrepentant, refusing to admit your wrongdoing!"
Gary's face turned red with anger, and he waved his hand. "You don't need to come tomorrow; our restaurant no longer has aplace for you!"

"Why?" Gemma turned pale. "Mr. Barnes, how can you be so unfair? It wasn't me; it was her carelessness, and she blamed me. I won't accept this!"

Gary was momentarily at a loss for words. "You..."

"Gemma, Anna," Lucius's assistant suddenly entered, calling out their names. "You two, come with me."

Her face was expressiónless, but it was chilling and scary.


Amelia was also surprised; how did Lucius know who did it?

"Why us?" Anna panicked. "It was Amelia who almost ruined Mr.Howard
s birthday party; it has nothing to do with us."

"Yeah!" Gemma's voice wavered, clearly guilty.

"It's fine if you don't come with me," the assistant crossed her arms."From now on, Anna, Gemma, and Gary are fired. Amelia will be in charge of the restaurant's orchestra."


"What?" The named individuals exclaimed in unison.

"Miss, why is this happening?" Amelia couldn't help but step forward and grab the assistant's hand.


Anna asked, "Why are we being fired? We didn't do anything!"

Gemma said, "Even if there's a mistake, it's Amelia's fault. What does it have to do with us?"


Anna and Gemma continued to argue,
Gary, however,slumped to the ground, as if suddenly struck by a severe illness. He spoke in a terrified voice, "I accept the punishment."

He had intended to use some information he accidentally learned to curry favor with Lucius, but it backfired. For someone like Lucius, merely firing him without further punishment was already lenient. He knew that saying another word would be asking for trouble.

"Amelia, you are now in charge of the orchestra. Do a good job; Mr.Howard won't treat you unfairly." Before leaving, the assistant smiled and said, "My name is Sable Baker; you cancall me Sable."

Amelia, still in a daze, nodded. When she recalled everything that had happened today, she still felt like she was dreaming.
###Chapter 18

"Mr. Spencer, we've got the scoop," Ryder Jones said, handing Chris a file."Lucius had a young lover named Bella White, and she looks a lot like Miss Tudor." Chris took the file without a word, flipping it open to see a photo that felt both familiar and strange.

"Is this Bella White?" Chris asked, holding the photo up to the light for a closer look.

The more he stared, the more she reminded him of Amelia,especially those eyes.

"Lucius is playing the replacement game, huh?" Chris sneered,flipping through a few more pages.

The file gave a quick rundown of Lucius and Bella's time in the orphanage.Lucius was often bullied, and Bella would step in to defend him. Once,she almost got molested while helping him out. Then, by some twist of fate,Lucius was adopted by Chris's grandfather, Victor Spencer. They got separated, and he lost all contact with Bella.

"Mr. Spencer, there's Miss Tudor," Ryder pointed out. Amelia was walking back with her bag.


Today was Amelia's first day as the orchestra leader, and it was a disaster.No one respected her because she was new, and everyone thought she got the job through shady means. Others had gone through tough competition to stay. Before the day ended, some even gossiped about her, and no one listened to her instructions. Amelia was feeling super anxious.

Out of the corner of her eye, she spotted a familiar figure. She looked closer and felt a wave of annoyance-it was Chris, the troublemaker.
"The replacement is back. What's the deal?" Chris smirked, raising his chin."Lucius didn't take advantage of you, or is he planning to make you fall for him first?"

Amelia thought, 'What is he even talking about?

"Are you nuts?" Amelia snapped, glaring at him before turning to leave.Her current mess was all thanks to Chris.

"Am I wrong?" Chris took a long stride, easily catching up with her and pulling her back by the arm.

She almost stumbled,feeling a wave of embarrassment.

Chris said coldly, "Seducing one guy after another,no wonder you were so eager to get a divorce."

He wrapped an arm around her waist, leaning in close,his gaze, like a hunter's, was fixed on her, the poor, weak prey.

Amelia had no strength to fight back. She suddenly remembered what happened in the Sapphire box that day, feeling both awkward and angry.

Chris never knew how to respect her; she was just a tool for his humiliation.


"Yeah, all the guys out there are more handsome, kinder, richer, and treat me better than you. I don't know why I was obsessed with you for so long;it's ridiculous!"


Before she could finish, he was choking her, almost cutting off her air.

The strength difference left her no room to resist, so she just accepted it.The fear in her eyes faded; she realized death wasn't so scary. After all,
she had nothing left now.

Chris mocked, "Lucius doesn't even see you as a person, yet you crawl to him!"

After what felt like forever, Chris finally let go,giving Amelia a chance to breathe.

Her body instinctively gasped for air, but she didn't respond to his taunts.
Instead, she shot back defiantly, "Even so,he is better than you."

Chris's face darkened, hiseyes filled with a murderous look.

She pushed further, fearless, "What kind of good person are you? Do you see me as a person? In your eyes, I'm just a tool for you to toy with and humiliate." She gritted her teeth, glaring at him fiercely, her rage boiling over. At this moment, she wasn't afraid of anything, not even death.

"Yeah, you are a tool for me to humiliate and toy with." Chris harshly threw her hand away, causing Amelia to stumble back, almost falling.

She trembled,trying to suppress the pain in her heart.

Chris was about to speak again when a familiar voice called out from nearby.


"Amelia, there you are! We've been looking everywhere for you." It was Nina.


She rushed over, grabbing Amelia's hand as if afraid she would run away again.

Nina asked, "Where have you been? You didn't even tell us. Luckily, we...Oh, Chris,you're here too. What's going on?"
Nina glanced at Chris, her eyes lighting up with excitement. "Great, your relationship is better than anything."

Chris looked at Nina with a half-smile. "We're arguing."

After saying that, he crossed his arms,ready to watch the show.

Hearing his words, Nina's face changed immediately. She grabbed Amelia's ear, gritting her teeth. "You little brat, you really have the guts to argue with Chris. You're too rebellious. Chris is such a good person; you should be pleasing him, not arguing with him."

Then, Nina lowered her voice and quickly said, "Amelia, if you offend Chris,you're dead!"

"Let go of me!" Amelia's ear hurt from her grip, and she forcefully shook off her arm. "All these years, you never considered me your daughter;I was just a commodity you raised. You sold me for a hefty sum,so you should be satisfied. I owe you nothing now!" Her voice was harsh.

Chris's eyelashes fluttered, his gaze darkening as he looked at her.

Nina couldn't believe that Amelia, this coward, would dare to speak to her like this one day.

Her face changed dramatically, looking at Amelia in disbelief. "You ungrateful bitch, how dare you? I gave birth to you and raised you for so many years. You owe me for life; don't think you can deny it!"


Seeing Amelia silent, Nina wanted to make a move again, but Amelia dodged, and she immediately became furious, commanding, "Apologize to Chris immediately; what right do you have to argue with him!"

Amelia laughed sadly. She looked at Chris, "You have won; you're really
despicable."

With a mother like Nina and such a background, what else could she do?Andthese things could be used as weapons to attack her.

Amelia thought, 'Look, even my mother doesn't protect me; what can I do?


Amelia turned and walked away, her figure thin but determined.

"You brat, come back here. Chris. I hope you don't mind.I'll bring her back to apologize to you..." Before Nina could finish, Chris had already turned and left.
###Chapter 19

Chris sat in the car for a long time.With the window half-open, he stared at the neighborhood gate in front of him.

Just from this gate, people could tell this place was a far cry from the luxury of Spencer Villa.

Amelia used to be part of the Spencer family, and now she was living in this dump? How could she settle for such a low-class slum? What was she thinking?

His mind drifted back to everything that had just happened. Amelia had definitely changed; she actually had the nerve to lose her temper with him.

Chris should have been happy; she was finally paying for her dumb choices. But weirdly, he didn't feel that way. Instead, he felt a strange discomfort, like Amelia's stubborn, tear-filled eyes were haunting him.It was really weird.

Chris punched the steering wheel, the pain snapping him back to reality and clearing his head.




Meanwhile, at Sophía's place, Amelia was packing her stuff.


Since her address was known, she couldn't stay here anymore.She didn't want to cause trouble for Sophia.


Nina kept blowing up her phone, threatening to make a scene in the neighborhood if she didn't come out to meet her.


Amelia turned off her phone, quickly packed her things, and grabbed a
cab to the Sapphire employee dormitory. For days, Nina kept hounding her and even showed up at her workplace. Shawn saw the whole thing and chased her away.

"Your mom recognized me and got the wrong idea about us. She told me not to go after you,saying you belong to Chris, in life and death," Shawn said, looking at her with a complicated expression. "I never knew you were Chris's wife."

"We're already divorced," Amelia shot back coldly. "I don't have a husband now."

Even though Chris didn't show up on the last day of the divorce cooling-off period and the divorce request was rejected, they'd split up sooner or later.

"My mom shouldn't have said such harsh things. I'm sorry on her behalf."She looked down, avoiding Shawn's eyes.

"Do you really need to apologize for her?" Shawn said, almost laughing."Does she even deserve to be called your mom? You might not even be her real kid; otherwise, how could she treat you like this?"

Amelia was lost in her thoughts and didn't respond.

Seeing her troubled look, Shawn quickly added, "I didn't mean it like that,but you can't let her keep harassing you any more."

Amelia nodded slowly, "Yeah, I need to do something about it."

"Once you handle this, I'll take you somewhere." Worried she might refuse.Shawn quickly added, "Think of it as compensation for the mental stressT've been through,okay?"
Amelia pressed her lips together, unsure of what to say.

She contacted Nina to meet at a café near the restaurant.

Nina showed up quickly, bringing her other daughter,Karen.

As soon as they arrived, they started laying into Amelia, insisting she go back to Chris and apologize.

"Damn it, I should've let Karen marry Chris back then. At least she's smart enough to win a man's heart!" Nina's voice was sharp, each word cutting into Amelia.

"Yeah, why was it me back then?" Amelia sneered,looking up at them.

Suddenly, she noticed that Nina and Karen's postures were identical, and their facial features and expressions were eerily similar.

Shawn's words from that day kept replaying in her head. "Because I wanted you to have a future, to revive our family. Who could have thought you were so useless, unable to handle such an easy case, and now ending up divorced."

"Amelia, I'm telling you, no matter what you do, even if you have to beg him,you must make him retract his decision. Otherwise, if you get divorced, I'll marry you off to the old man!" Nina pointed at her nose,her voice getting louder.


"Karen and I are both your daughters," Amelia said in a low voice.

Nina laúghed exaggeratedly, her expression almost comical. "How can you compare to my daughter? You're just..."

Before she coud finish, Karen yanked her sleeve hard.
Nina's face darkened, and she immediately frowned with regret, but the unfinished half of her sentence still lingered in Amelia's mind.

So her guess was not wrong. Then everything made sense.

Nina said, "What are you thinking? I've raised you for so many years and provided you with excellent material conditions. What more could you possibly want? Right now, you need to pull yourself together and seriously think about how to win back Mr. Spencer's heart!"

"We're already divorced," Amelia said, her gaze depressed and calm."I won't be with him again, and I won't be coerced by you anymore."

With that,she stood up and walked out, leaving Nina and Karen in shock.

"Stop!" Karen shouted, gritting her teeth in anger. "How can you be so ungrateful? Mom is doing this for your own good. Mr. Spencer is such an excellent man. What kind of man can you find after leaving him? Do you really want to be a second wife to an old man?"

"If you think he's perfect, why don't you marry him?" Amelia's voice was calm and cold.


Karen's face froze, filled with shame and anger. Did she not want to marry Chris? In the entire Pinecrest elite circle, no unmarried woman didn't like Chris. He was practically perfect, like a dream lover.

Karen once used her identity as Amelia's sister to seduce Chris with her naked body. She still remembered Chris's disdainful look and words.

"Where did you get the confidence to think you could compare to Amelia?If you don't want your body to be found in the sea the next day, get out."

Karen thought, 'Amelia, that bitch, had Chris's immense favor but didn't
know how to cherish it!

Karen seethed with resentment: "If it weren't for Chris's grandfather forcing him to marry you, do you think with your lowly status, he would even look at you?"

Nina also shouted, "Amelia, you bitch, how dare you mock Karen?"

"Watch your language. This is a high-end place. Someone might have already recorded your disgraceful behavior and is ready to post it online,ruining your reputation."

With that, Amelia took ouat her phone, which was recording, and waved it lightly. Then she said calmly, "I have nothing to lose now. If you make my life difficult, I won't show you any mercy."

She had rehearsed these words countless times in her mind. As long as she managed to overcome the fear in her mind, she believed she could overcome any challenge.

Nina and Karen looked at her with extreme shock. They were probably wondering how the once timid Amelia, who didn't even dare to cry when bullied, had become like this.

"Besídes, consider the two billion dollarsas repayment for raising me.From today on, we are done with each other." With that, Amelia left coldly.

Nina and Karen exchanged glances, both seeing deep shock in each other's eyes.

Nina snapped, "Bitch, how dare she threaten me!"

"Mom,what do we do now?" Karen asked, unwilling to give up.
Nina said, "Don't worry; I'll handle this. Do you think she can escape my control?"
###Chapter 20

Nina dropped her head and started pacing, her mind racing for a solution.

After a while, her expression shifted a few times. Then she suddenly turned to Karen with a weird question. "Have you noticed how Chris's attitude towards that useless Amelia has changed lately?"

Karen burst out laughing, "Mom, are you serious? I'd sooner believe that bitch Amelia would get hit by a car the moment she steps outside!"

She crossed her arms and gave Nina a look like she was crazy.

Nina ignored her rudeness and muttered to herself, "No matter what, we should give it a shot."




Meanwhile, Amelia got a call from Victor's assistant, asking her to come back to the Spencer Mansion over the weekend because Victor wanted to see her.


Amelia hesitated.

Victor was one of the few people who treated her well, but he was always busy and rarely home. Whenever he came home, he'd hear about her awful situation with Chris from others and then harshly scold Chris.

Every time that happened, her life got even harder. But she hadn't seen Victor in over two months. Should she go? Maybe she should, just to say goodbye. He'd find out about her divorce from Chris sooner or later anyway,

But after work that day, Amelia happened to see the person she both
loved and hated in the employee passage behind the restauant.

Chris was leaning against his car, eyes slightly narrowed, giving her a half-smile.

Amelia pretended not to see him.

"Stop," Chris ordered.

Amelia quickened her pace, but he easily caught up to her,grabbed her arm, and forced her to look at him.

"What do you want?" Amela felt flustered just being near him.

She had made up her mind to leave him and hoped not to see him again.
Otherwise, she feared she couldn't bear to leave him.

Chris pressed his lips together, irritated by Amelia's impatience.

"You didn't used to treat ine with this kind of attitude. Do you need me to remind you?" Chris asked.


Amelia sighed and asked patiently, "What do you want? Just say it."

She took a few steps away from Chris, silently distancing herself from him.


Chris narrowed his eyes but surprisingly didn't get angry at her small action. He lazily said, "Getting bolder? Do you really think I can't do anything to you?"


"How could you possibly be powerless against me? At your commnand,1might be dead. The fact that I'm standing here unharmed is solely due to your excessive leniency," she mocked, shaking off his hand.

"Tomorrow, I'm going back to the Spencer Mansion. I'm warning you,
Grandpa is coming back, and you..."

Chris raised an eyebrow and smiled, his eyes dark and dangerous. "Grandpa already had someone notify you, saving me the trouble."

So,he came to block her today for this reason. But it was strange.Even if he had something to tell her, he could have just sent a message or an email, or sent someone else to notify her, like many times before. Why did he come in person? Was he here to cause trouble?

"Remember this," Chris stepped closer, his voice particularly cold. "Yoưbetter keep the secret from Grandpa. If he finds out anything..."

He didn't finish the sentence. Because he knew better than anyone that Amelia, who valued relationships,wouldn't do that.

Amelia's eyes were a bit sore as she took two steps back. "Finished? If you're done, I'm leaving."

She felt very unwell, her head occasionally dizzy, and her breathing becoming rapid. She just wanted to leave quickly.

"In such a hurry to meet that Shawn?" Chris grabbed her wrist. "A worthless person like him suits you well.".


Was he losing it again? What kind of nonsense was he spouting now?

Amelia felt numb. It was no longer surprising how badly he thought of her.


Just then, Shawn's voice cut through the tension, "Let her go!"

Amelia's back stiffened. Why was he here?

"Let me go!" She tried to shake off Chris's grip, but he was too strong.
Chris tightened his hold, like he was going to crush her wrist.

"You like him so much that you're willing to divorce me for him?" Chris questioned.

Amelia felt helpless, like her fate was out of her hands. She gave a bitter smile. "Yes, I'm doing it for him. Are you satisfied?"

Chris said, "Don't forget; we haven't.." Before he could finish, Amelia cut him off,"So what?"

Amelia knew she shouldn't provoke him, but she couldn't hold back any more. "So what if we haven't divorced? In my heart, you're no longer my husband!"

Their eyes locked, and she could see herself reflected in his pupils. But she couldn't read his emotions. His grip slowly loosened.

She took the chance to break free and ran without looking back.

Shawn had been trailing behind her and finally caught up to walk by her side.


"Are you okay?" His voice was anxious and cautious.

Amelia was about to answer when she suddenly felt dizzy, and everything went dark. She screamed in fear and collapsed,tears streaming down her face.

"What's wrong with you?" Shawn was shocked, trying to help her. Seeing her tears, he was at a loss and cautiously asked, "Where do you feel unwell? I'll take you to the hospital."

Amelia covered her eyes, trembling. She was terrified that when she
opened them again, the world would still be dark.

"I'm fine..." She tried to suppress her panic, groping to get up, and slowly opened her eyes.

Oh God, it was still dark. Amelia's tears kept falling.


She closed her eyes in pain, desperately thinking about what to do.

"Tll take you to the hospital." Shawn's voice was genle as he approached her, "Don't worry. I'll help you."

At this moment, he was the only one who had seen her most vulnerable side. And now, she could only accept his help.

They quickly went to the hospital, where Shawn used his family's influence to get an appointment with the top doctor.

The doctor examined her, and through the use of medication,her vision was restored. However, the situation remained far from optimistic.

"Míss Tudor, your condition is now critical and greatly affected by your emotional state. I strongly recommend undergoing surgery as soon as possible," the doctor said.


"What is the success rate of the surgery?" Amelia asked, surprisingly calm.

The doctor thought for a moment and said, "With our hospital's current capabilities, there's a 40% success rate. If you delay, the success rate will continue to decrease,"


In other words, the surgery had a high chance of failure, resulting in permanent blindness.

But if she didn't have the surgery, the probability of permanent blindness
would be 100%.

"When is the earliest we can schedule the surgery?" Shawn asked.

"Within three days," the doctor estimated, then he said to Amelia, "If the surgery is in three days, you'll need to be hospitalized for tests in the next two days."

"No." Amelia shook her head, "I have things to do in the next two days.Please give me some medication for now."

"What else could be more important than your health?" Shawn was puzzled and angry.
###Chapter 21

After a long silence, Amelia forced a smile. "I've got more important things to handle. Don't worry, once I sort everything out, I won't delay."

The important thing was meeting Victor.

The next day, after finishing work, Amelia was about to grab a taxi to the Spencer Mansion when she ran into Lucius outside the restaurant.
Coincidentally, he was also heading to the Spencer Mansion and offered her a ride.

Amelia felt she couldn't refuse his kind offer, so she hopped into his car.

"You seemed to be in a low mood lately. Did something happen?" Lucius asked suddenly while they were waiting at the traffic light.

His profile looked gentle, but for some reason, Amelia always felt she couldn't see through him. He was very mysterious.

"Just some trivial life stuff." She averted her gaze, looking out the car window. They were already close to the Spencer Mansion.

Lucius pondered for a moment and then said, "Chris has no sense of boundaries and can be thoughtless sometimes. If he bullies you again, just let me know."


Amelia didn't dare to anger Chris, nor did she dare to anger Lucius.

"No need to trouble Mr. Howard. Chris and I will part ways soon," she said.


Lucius didn't seem surprised, just nodded lightly. "If you need help, tell me."
Amelia couldn't respond.

Lucius then continued, "Amelia, I don't make promiseslightly."

The implication was that he was serious.

"I will," Amelia was slightly moved.

Soon they arrived outside the Spencer Mansion.

Amelia suggested they get out of the car one after the other to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.

So after Lucius went inside, she got out of the car and walked in.

Unexpectedly, she suddenly heard clapping behind her.

"Impressive, in just a few days, you're already coming back with the Spencer family's stepson." Chris's words were as harsh as ever.

Amelia knew she couldn't avoid it, so she simply looked over, facing Chris's mocking eyes.

She pressed her lips together and said, "Yes, when I meet someone better,I must seize the opportunity."

Chris's face turned dark, his tall and slender figure approaching step by step. "What about the lover from yesterday? Can you handle two men?"

Amelia's eyes turned cold. "That's none of your business, Mr. Spencer."

"Amelia, how long are you going to be this bitch? Selling yourself to me wasn't enough; how many more times do you want to sell yourself?" Chris's voice was exceptionally cold.
Amelia's back trembled with fear. She had to bite her teeth hard, just looking at him quietly. "I said, it's none of your business. We have nothing to do with each other anymore."

"I shouldn't have shown you mercy on our wedding day!" Chris was completely enraged, grabbing her shoulder. With a slight force, she was in so much pain that her expression changed dramatically.

"Let go of me!" Amelia felt a sharp pain in her shoulder,her voice struggling to come out from deep in her throat."You bastard!"

"I'm a bastard, then what is Lucius? He knows we're not divorced yet,but he's still eager to be with the woman I dumped?" Chris grabbed her collar,pulling her in front of him.

In the moment their eyes met, what flashed in his mind was her words from yesterday,"In my heart,you're no longer my husband."

Then who was her husband in her heart? Lucius, or Shawn?

"Interesting?" Amelia's body and heart both ached, and tears welled up in her eyes. She tried to escape, but it was pointless, so she gave up.

Seeing her tear-streaked face, Chris felt an unexpected pang in his heart.He subconsciously let go of her.

"You cry so miserably; others might think I bullied you again," he said impatiently, then walked ahead.

Amelia coughed several times, wiped her tears, and turned to walk in the other direction.


Chris abruptly turned his head,expecting to see Amelia follow him, but instead caught sight of her taking a different path into the estate, her
silhouette resolute and unyielding. It was as if her countless declarations of leaving him had finally become reality.
He inexplicably moved his hand, wanting to grab something,but caught nothing. He could only watch her walk farther and faster. At that moment,his heart felt even more stifled.

Amelia, led by a servant, entered the Spencer family's banquet hall.

The unbearable memories from the past surged like a tide,making her tense and anxious. But it didn't matter, this should be the last time.

"Isn't this Chris's wife? Why are you so late?" A young woman in a white bodycon dress walked over. "It's rare to see you here. We thought you would never set foot here again. What a surprise."

Amelia recognized this woman; her name was Stella Spencer, the youngest daughter of Chris's uncle. She was in her early twenties and still attending university. Her appearancê inherited the distinctive features of the Spencer family,rendering her both beautiful and strikingly formidable.

Stella, like the other members of the Spencer family who saw Amelia as an object of ridicule, treated her as a servant to be toyed with and despised.

In the past, Amelia would have avoided such situations immediately. She couldn't afford to provoke Stella, nor her parents.

"Move," Amelia's voice was indifferent. "I'mn here to see Grandpa."

Her voice was calm and unyielding, making Stella freeze for a second.

"You're here to see Grandpa? Don't you know today is the monthly family dinner he set? Dressed so poorly, is this your attitude towards Grandpa?"Stella sneered, looking Amelia up and down. "It seems that after leaving
Chris, your life isn't going well. Have you finally come to your senses and want to reconcile with Chris? You're so low."

"All because of you." Amelia looked at her coldly.

Stella frowned. "What does this have to do with me?"

"Exactly." Amelia sneered. "What does it have to do with you?"

With that, she turned to leave.

"You..." Stella's face darkened with anger, and she immediately tripped Amelia.

Unexpectedly, Amelia stomped hard on her instep; Stella cried out in pain.
"Amelia, are you insane?!" Her voice was loud and piercing.

Amelia raised an eyebrow. "Sorry, I didn't falI for your trick."

Stella cursed, "You bitch!" >

"Stella!" Una Roberts scolded softly from a distance. "Let her go."

Stella's face turned red with anger. "Mom, this bitch ruined my carefully chosen stockings. I must teach her a lesson today!"

Una coldly said, "Your grandpa is coming out soon. Shut up for now;we'll deal with this later."


"Mom, even if Grandpa comes out, I'm in the right. That bitch bullied me;
I can't just let her off easily, can I?" Stella was very dissatisfied.

"Then what do you want?" Suddenly, a familiar voice sounded.
55
###Chapter 22

Stella's body trembled, and she turned around in disbelief, only to see a face that filled her with fear.

Stella said, "Chris, you're here too."

Stella lowered her head guiltily, not even daring to look at Chris.


But she was also puzzled.What's going on? Chris had always looked down on that bitch Amelia. Why he suddenly cared about her?

"I'm asking you a question." Chris stopped in front of her,looking down at her with a powerfu aura.

Stella trembled all over with fear and instinctively sought help from her mother. UJna had to smile and say, "Chris, since you're back, you should go see your grandfather. He's waiting for you in the study."

"You're right." Chris raised an eyebrow and smiled, then turned to leave.

He had always been capricious; everyone had grown accustomed to it.

Stella let out a heavy sigh of relief.


But then Chris spoke again, his voice cold, "I heard you've always wanted to further your studies at the university your father attended. Forget about it. I'll find you another school. How about leaving tomorrow?"

"What do you mean?" Stella was directly confused.

"How about Sahara University? Leave here tomorrow. Don't disappoint my good intentions." Chris added indifferently.

"No way!" Stella was shocked, "Sahara University is in the coldest city in
the Northern Hemisphere. I'm most sensitive to the cold, Chris.Can I not go there?"

She still couldn't figure out why Chris suddenly interfered in her affairs for no reason.

Una reacted quickly and hurriedly said, "Stella, apologize to Chris right now, and from now on, you must respect Amelia!"

Stella was stunned and said in disbelief, "Mom, you..."

"Why apologize to mne? Did she bully me?" Chris said indifferently, "Your parenting style is really concerning."

If not him, then should Stella apologize to Amelia? Una didn't have time to think about why he suddenly became abnormal, but it didn't matter. The two of them just needed to follow Chris's implication.

"Alright, I will have Stellą apologize to Amelia immediately." She hastily pulled Stella upstairs.

This scene was all seen by Lucius in the corner of the second floor.

At this moment, Amelia was sitting in Victor's study, chatting with him.She liked Victor very much, not because he was still the head of the Spencer family, but because he was optimistic and kind, always caring for her. So every time he was at home, her days were much better.

"Amelia, when do you plan to have a child with Chris? Let me have the chance to hold my great-grandson as soon as possible, okay?" Victor smiled and pushed a plate of sweets in front of Amelia,his eyes as friendly as ever.

Amelia didn't respond but lowered her head shyly, tucking a strand of
hair behind her ear.

Victor laughed heartily and asked Amelia what she had been up to recently.
"Grandpa, I recently found a job playing the piano at a restaurant. A few days ago, I got promoted and became the head of the band. My salary has increased several times." Amelia said happily.

Victor was stunned, "You found a job? What's going on? Did Chris ask you to,or..."

"No, Grandpa, I was just bored staying at home alone, so I thought it would be good to go out and work. It's better than doing nothing at home every day." Amelia wasn't good at lying. When she lied, she would unconsciously look to the left, so she had to lower her head and pretend to rub her hands.

Victor gave her a meaningful look but didn't say much.

They chatted about other topics. Amelia felt that Victor's mindset was still very young. He could handle any topic with ease and even asked if she wanted to set off fireworks together later.

They were having a pleasant conversation when Stella knocked and came in.


"What's wrong? Who bullied you? Why do you look so down?" Victor immediately noticed something was wrong and quickly waved Stella over.

Stella glanced quickly at Amelia, her eyes full of unwillingness. But thinking of Chris's stern face, she had to lower her head.

"Grandpa, I'm here to apologize to Amelia." Without further explanation,
she walked straight up and bowed to Amelia, "Amelia, I was wrong just now. I shouldn't have talked back to you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me."
She thought this was enough. She had never been so respectful to anyone before!

"Amelia, what happened? Did she talk back to you?" Victor frowned at Amelia.

Amelia smiled indifferently. "It's not a big deal, Grandpa. Take it easy."

She didn't even look at Stella. This wasn't the first time Stella had bullied her. She had mocked her many times before, brought outsiders to laugh at her, and even once pushed her into the lake in the backyard in the middle of winter.

Amelia wouldn't forget these things; this apology held no significance.

"Stella, what on earth are you troubling Amelia for this time?" Victor,
clearly aware of the situation, looked particularly displeased.

Stella looked at Amelia, her eyes sharp, as if saying, 'I've already apologized,what more do you want?


"Grandpa, it's not something serious. Stella just mocked me a couple of times as usual, called me a bitch, and tried to trip me to embarrass me in public." Amelía comfortingly held Victor's hand. "Grandpa, I'm not that fragile. These little tricks can't hurt me, and I won't really hold it against her."


She said she wouldn't hold a grudge, while revealing Stella's actions at the same time.

Stella's face changed instantly. This bitch was crazy. She had already
apologized, and Amelia stillreported her to Grandpa!

She glared at Amelia and coldly rebuked, "What nonsense are you talking about? When did I..."

"Shut up!" Victor slammed the table and stood up. "You dare to speak to Amelia like this in front of me. I can only imagine how excessive you are behind my back. You don't need to attend today's family dinner anymore.Go to your room and reflect on your mistakes. When you truly realized your mistakes, apologize to Amelia properly, or I will never forgive you!"

"Grandpa. Grandpa, I already apologized. Just now, she even stepped on my foot,tearing my stockings!" Stella cried with tears in her eyes, grabbing Victor's hand, trying to plead for herself.

"If you didn't provoke Amelia, would you suffer the consequences? Stella,you disappoint me too much!" Victor angrily shook her off and turned to leave.


"Grandpa, watch your step." Amelia carefully supported Victor, "Calm down; anger can take a toll on your health."
###Chapter 23

Amelia helped Victor out of the study, but as they reached the corner of the stairs, they ran into Chris.

He was just chilling there, leaning against the wall, his eyes casually sweeping over Amelia before he stepped forward to heIp support Victor's other arm.

"What were you doing just now, leaving Amelia to come over alone?"Victor snapped at him.

"You should ask her," Chris shot back, sneaking a glance at Amelia from behind Victor. His gaze was intense, but she didn't even flinch.

He cursed under his breath, 'Damn it!'

"Forget it, you young people always give me a headache. But today, you better take good care of Amelia. If she complains about you to me, you'll be in big trouble. And..." Victor started to lecture, but Amelia and Chris were already tuning him out.

Victor was the star of today's party, and as soon as he showed up,everyone from the Spencer family flocked around him, exchanging greetings and making the whole place buzz with excitement.

Amelia took a few steps back, finding a quiet corner to sit and sip on some freshly squeezed juice, wondering when it would be a good time to make her exit.

"Miss Tudor, would you like another glass?" a maid with a sweet voice asked,smiling.

Amelia looked up and realized she didn't recognize this maid. Must be
new. Otherwise, why would she be so warm to her?

"Sure, another glass, please. Thanks." Amelia felt like the room was unusually warm today. The sweet and tangy juice might help cool her down a bit.

In about ten minutes, she had downed two glasses of juice, but instead of cooling off, she felt even hotter, and some weird sensations were creeping up on her.


Was her vision impairment getting so bad that it was affecting other parts of her body too?


"What's wrong, Amelia?" Victor came over with his cane, looking concerned. "Are you feeling unwell? Do you need me to get someone to check on you?"


Amelia quickly waved him off. "It's not necessary, Grandpa. I'm just a bit tired."


"Then you should go rest. I'll have someone take you there. No point in staying here if you're not feeling well," Victor said gently.


Amelia was about to say she wanted to go back, but then she remembered that Victor didn't know she and Chris were on the verge of divorce.Plus,Chris had just threatened her, so she couldn't let Victor catch on.

"Okay, I'll gorest then." Amelia decided to stay here for the night.


The maid led her to the master bedroom on the third floor where she used to stay, "Mrs. Spencer, please rest. I won't disturb you."

After the door closed, Amelia went in, took a quick shower, and changed into a thin nightgown.
She couldn't tell if it was just her imagination, but her head felt unusually heavy, and that strange sensation was still there.

She closed her eyes,hoping to sleep. She didn't know how much time had passed when she suddenly felt someone beside her.

In her groggy state, Amelia thought she was dreaming and didn't bother to open her eyes.


"Sleeping so soundly?" Chris muttered. Propping his chin with one hand,he looked at Amelia's peaceful sleeping face in the dark, feeling something unusal.


They had been married for three years but had never slept in the same bed.It was only because Victor ordered him to take care of her that he reluctantly came over.


But who was she thinking about? Her brows were furrowed so tightly.

"Chris..." Suddenly, a sweet murmur escaped from Amelia's throat.


Chris's whole body tensed up inexplicably, his gaze darkening.

Her cheeks were flushed, her eyelashes trembling lightly,and her soft body exuded a fresh and captivating fragrance, making her incredibly alluring.


"You still love me, don't you?" Chris quietly observed her, suddenly noticing something off in her expression.


Amelia's delicate brows were slightly furrowed, unconscious moans of discomfort escaping her throat, her body moving involuntarily. Most importantly, she wasn't fully conscious,

Was she drugged with an aphrodisiac, or was she doing this on purpose,
trying to seduce him?

Chris's gaze darkened.

"Chris." She moaned softly again.

This time he heard it more clearly.

The next moment, she turned over, her hot, delicate arm draping over his waist,rubbing unconsciously, clearly already in a state of emotional turmoil.

Chris's gaze grew even darker. Damn it, today he found Amelia's face increasingly tempting, her voice and body the same.

She was seducing him, arousing his desire.

"Do you know what you're doing?" Chris's hand stroked her neck, trying to snap her out of it.


The pressure wasn't heavy, but the touch on a sensitive spot made Amelia snap to attention. She opened her eyes, and when she saw who was in front of her, she was shocked and pushed him away hard.


"Why is it you?" Her voice was loud with fear, not knowing what had just happened.

But that simple question instantly pissed Chris off.

He laughed lowly, looking down at her. "If not me,then who? Amelia,who do you expect to sleep with you? Are you that desperate for a man?"

It was only then that Amelia sensed something abnormal; she became aware of the lust surging within her.

At this moment, all she could think of was to get out of there immediately.
She tried to get up but found herself weak, her legs trembling as she fell onto the thick carpet.

Chris swiftly stepped forward, grabbed her, and threw her back onto the bed.

Before Amelia could react, he was already pressing her down on the bed.

Her back sank into the soft silk quilt, the cool touch not quenching the fire-like desire in her heart but instead fueling it, threatening to consume her sanity.

The next moment, she heard his mocking words. "Had enough of pretending?"


Chris gripped her shoulders tightly, with humiliation and contempt."I know exactly what you're up to. You think sleeping with me and getting pregnant will secure your position as Mrs. Spencer."

He laughed lowly. "But to fulfill Grandpa's wish, I don't mind making you pregnant."


With that, he lowered his head and kissed her, his hand pressing her head firmly.

Shame and anger surged in her heart, overshadowing the desire induced by the aphrodisiac. Amelia was filled with resentment.

Why did Chris always have to humiliate her like this? She was a normal person;she also could, feel hurt and pain.

Chris was gentler than last time. He held her lips, entangling her tongue,his hot, broad hand patiently teasing and caressing her body.
Her body was immersed in desire, but her rationality made her suffer. The ridiculous thing was, to fulfill Victor's wish, Chris could even compromise himself to sleep with her.

As Amelia closed her eyes in disappointment, a tear fell. Then she raised her foot and kicked fiercely to Chris, while he was in the intimate moment.

Chris's calf was suddenly kicked hard by her, the pain not significant but enough to anger him again.

"Let go of me; get away!" Amelia's eyes were glistening with tears. "I could have sex to anyone, except you!"

"Don't forget we're not divorced yet." Chris was almost driven mad by her words, losing his rationality, "Are you thinking of cheating? Dream on."

This time, he was no longer gentle; he roughly tore off her thin nightgown.exposing her full, tempting body, his eyes filledwith desire.

Amelia frantically tried to cover herself but was grabbed by Chris,her hands pinned to the bed. his strong thigh forcing her legs apart.

She was forced into a humiliating position, her face flushed with anger,brimming with tears.


His gaze darkened, sneering. "Who do you want to see you like this?
Shawn or Lucius?"

Amelia cursed, "Chris, you bastard!"

Facing her curse, Chris just sneered. The next moment, he indifferently thrust into her body.

Amelia's face turned pale, biting her lip in pain but stubbornly refusing to
cry out.

Red blood flowed from where their bodies joined,staining the sheets.

It was a symbol of purity, softening Chris's expression. He was about to say something when Amelia sneered and closed her eyes calmly,saying"Just finish quickly."


Her careless attitude enraged Chris.

Chris asked. "Do you have to provoke me?"

"Fine, I'll grant your wish!" With that, he lifted her waist in a rude manner,using a deep position, entering her body roughly and repeatedly.

During her first time having sex, Amelia could hardly endure such rough and violent passion. However, due to the aphrodisiac in her system, the physical pain transformed into overwhelming pleasure and ecstasy.


Amelia bit her lip the whole time, even drawing blood, cold sweat drippng from her forehead, but she stubbornly refused to moan.


This night was destined to be long and hard.

Chris, as if in a fit of anger, tormented Amelia again and again unti1 she moaned sweetly, her eyes red, begging him for mercy. Only then did he become gentle, ending the intense sex.

The first light of dawn pierced through the gap in the blackout curtains,falling on Amelia's pale, beautiful face. She hadn't woken up yet; under the covers was her slender body marked with traces of sex. At this moment,she was being watched by a pair of eyes.
###Chapter 24

Chris, with a satisfied grin, kept his head propped up with one hand,quietly watching Amelia, who was still fast asleep.

Last night was something else. At first, he wanted to make her surrender,to hear her moan under him.


But as things heated up, he lost control, giving in to the passion. He entered her over and over, loving the sight of her flushed face fiiled with lust. and silencing her moans with kisses.

It was the first time they had sex over the three years. Oddly, Chris didn't feel any disgust; instead, he was pretty intrigued. If it weren't for the fact that it was her first time and her body hadIn't fully recovered, he would've wanted to go for another round in the morning.

Suddenly, Amelia's eyelashes fluttered. Chris quickly wiped the faint smile off his face.


Amelia had a terrible nightmare, where she was abused, her soul and body completely shattered.

Just before waking up, she felt like she was being choked,as if someone was trying to take her life. She woke up in a great fear, the feeling of suffocation still lingering.

The next second, a dull pain hit her all over, especially between her legs.

"Awake?" Chris's cold voice suddenly cut through the silence,making Amelia panic.

She turned her head sharply, meeting his deep brown eyes.
"Chris!" Amelia gritted her teeth. "You, last night it was you..."

So it wasn't a dream. Under the influence of the aphrodisiac, she had given in to this jerk Chris, getting lost in that emotionless sex.

To Chris, her words were like a slap in the face.

His face darkened, his voice dangerously low, "Who did you think it was?"

In that moment. Amelia felt the familiar fear of being controlled.

No! She couldn't go back to that.

"Anyone but you." She sneered, getting up and hastily putting on her clothes, ready to leave without a second thought.

She couldn't ignore the marks all over her body, which were her shame,something she could never wash away.


"Say that again!" Chris grabbed her,his tall and slender figure looming over her like a terrifying Satan.

Amelia was forced to look up at him, their eyes meeting. In his brown eyes,she saw her own reflection, as frail and helpless as countless times before.

She smiled sadly, then harshly shook off his hand, saying, "Using violence to bully women, what kind of man are you!"

"You..."

Before Chris could snap back at her, she had already opened the door.

A maid stood outside, telling her that Victor was already up and waiting for them downstairs for breakfast.

Amelia showed a gentle smile, "I've already tidied up; I'll be right down."

Luckily, her clothes could cover the marks on her body; otherwise,she would be deadly ashamed.


"Amelia,you should try to eat a bit more. You look so skinny, your clothes are hanging off you. Is Chris treating you badly again?" At the dining table.Victor said with great concern.

He was kind, unlike the rest of the Spencer family.

"Okay, Grandpa, I'll try to." Amelia didn't want to disappoint Victor, so she ate a lot and kept reminding him to take care of his health.


Before leaving, she even suggested taking a few photos with Victor as a memento. She knew that she probably wouldn't be back here again, nor would she have the chance to see V/ictor again.


As for the mess last night, she no longer had the strength to figure out the truth.


Regardless of who set her up or Chris's sudden surge of desire, the outcome was unchangeable. She was utterly exhausted and now only wished to go home and get a good night's'sleep.

Since Chris missed the appointment at the city hall, Amelia had a hell of a time trying to get in touch with him to sort out the divorce.

Whenever she called, the calls were either hung up or answered by his assistant. On the rare occasions Chris did pick up, he'd hang up as soon as she started talking. She couldn't help but wonder, 'Does Chris not even have time to handle the divorce?

But then, the media was always buzzing about Chrisand Leila showing up
at various events together. Leila was gushing to the press about how she was about to be with Chris.

Amelia felt a pang of bitterness. If Chris wanted to be with another woman,why not divorce her first? Was he punishing her for wanting out?

She kept herself super busy, trying not to think about Chris.One afternoon.she saw the ever-glamorous Leila and realized more than a month had passed.


Leila asked, "Tell me, what will it take for you to leave, or to divorce him?Whatever you need, just name it."


Leila sat in the restaurant's private room, looking all high and mighty,sneering at Amelia with contempt.


Since hooking up with Chris, Leila's career had skyrocketed, with high-end endorsements falling into her lap. The only thing bugging her was that Chris hadn't divorced the bitch Amelia yet. She figured Amelia was shamelessly clinging to Chris.

Back then,Amelia had married Chris with Victor's backing; even now,she still held onto the title of his wife, which really pissed Leila off.

If it weren't for that, she would have been Chris's wife by now!

"Miss, if you need anything, contact the waiter," Amelia said calmly,ready to leave the private room. She was the head of the restaurant's band,and her job was to perform, not to serve Leila.

"Stop, you're not leaving until we clear this up," Leila ordered coldly,her bodyguards blocking the ddoor.

Amelia's face darkened, then she turned to Leila and sneered,"Clear what
up? You should ask Chris why he won't divorce."

"Amelia, do you think Chris is clinging to you? You're delusional," Leila mocked,though there was a hint of jealousy in her eyes.

She didn't want to admit it, but since coming back and sticking to Chris,she'd noticed something was off.

In the past, Chris never denied her anything. When they were dating and she said she wanted to marry him, he agreed right away.

Being his savior had its perks; no matter how many mistakes she made,the worst that happened was a breakup. Chris always took her back. But now, he was getting more and more impatient with her.

Leila gritted her teeth, "If it weren't for my career taking me abroad for a few years, you wouldn't have had a chance. Now that I'm back,you should leave Chris."

Amelia said, "Fine, if you can convince Chris to go to the City Hall,I'd be more than happy to leave him."

Amelia couldn't wait for Leila to drag Chris to the city hall. As long as the divorce went through and Chris didn't miss the thirty-day waiting period,she'd be free of him.

Leila waved her phone. "You said it yourself; I recorded it as proof.Don't back out."

"Provided you can get Chris to make the decision," Amelia said coldly,turning to leave.
###Chapter 25

"Hope so," Amelia muttered, stepping out.

Only she knew the ache in her heart. She tried her best to ignore those memories, but they kept creeping back. Could she ever escape Chris in her world?





"Chris, what's up with you these past couple of days? You seem totally out of it," Nolan Powell said, lounging lazily in his seat and eyeing his friend Chris with curiosity. "I've never seen you like this before. Spill it; did some girl break your heart, and now you're all mopey?"

Chris shot him an annoyed look. "Get lost."

Nolan chuckled. "I heard Amelia hasn't been around lately. Not having your desires fulfilled? Need me to find you a girl?"

"Fuck off!" Chris snapped, glaring at the playboy Nolan before grabbing the bottle on the table and pouring himself a full glass.

It wasn't surprising that Nolan had his suspicions. Chris had been acting weird these past few days.

Chris couldn't stop thinking about Amelia, especially that wild night they had.

Even in the dead of night, when he couldn't sleep, he would replay her every move and every expression in his mind. He felt like he was crazy.

"I think you're just pent up. Since you don't want to be with other women.why not invite Amelia over for a drink? You two can go home together.
and then, you know, things might happen naturally."

"Enough already," Chris's face was unpleasant, but it was clear he wasn't entirely against the idea.

Nolan, always quick to catch on, immediately had someone call Amelia.

Feeling that a phone call wasn't fast enough, Nolan even sent someone to fetch Amelia in Victor's name.

Amelia rushed over, only to be led into a room reeking of alcohol. There was no sign of Victor, just a bunch of partygoers eager to see what would happen.

Nolan said, "Amelia, come on in. Chris is here,and he's been waiting for you."

Nolan, a well-known socialite, had been abroad for the past two years and had just returned. So he wasn't aware of the drama between Amelia and Chris. He still thought Amelia was the girl who was head over heels for Chris.

"Is this a joke?" Amelia glanced áround at the people present; most of whom had mocked and humiliated her before.

"It's not that serious, Amelia. What's going on between you and Chris? Are you two having a fight? It's nothing, really. Just spend one night with him,and everything will be fine." Nolan smiled, holding her shoulders and pushing her towards Chris.

Amelia struggled, and accidentally stepped on an empty bottle on the floor.She slipped and fell uncontrollably.

Her hand landed on Chris's thigh, and she ended up kneeling. Talk about
awkward and embarrassing!

The room went dead silent.

Even Nolan, who was always talkative, was left speechless.

Realizing her situation, she turned beet red. She quickly pulled her hand back, but it brushed against a certain part between his legs.

"If you hurt it, what will you use?" Chris snapped coldly. "Get up."

Without a word, she got up and tried to bolt, but Chris yanked her down to sit beside him.

Everyone was shocked.

What was going on? Chris had always looked down on this wife he had bought at a high price. Had he changed his tune?

"Let me go!" Amelia hissed. "If you don't want to make a scene, let go of me right now."

Chris wasn't fazed. Instead, he smirked. "If you don't want your dad to recover and get out of the hospital, go ahead and make a fuss."

"Come on, Amelia, since you're here, have a drink with us." Nolan, trying to lighten the mood, poured a glass of wine and handed it to her.

Amelia reluctantly took it, hesitated for a moment, then downed it in one go.

Life was full of unwillingness. Since she was here,she had to play along for now. Otherwise, these playboys wouldn't let her leave.

She glanced at Chris, who was sitting nearby. His eyes were dark and
unreadable, but he kept staring at her.

He knew she couIdn't handle her liquor. Was he waiting for her to make a fool of herself?

"Amelia, you're so straightforward!" Nolan laughed, eyeing her,then turned to see Chris still watching her.

Nolan immediately got it. With his playboy mindset, he could only think of one thing: Amelia and Chris probably had a lousy sex life, making things awkward. He had to help.

Nolan signaled to the others, and they all gathered around, each wanting to drink with Amelia, acting like they had no past beef with her.

Amelia wanted to back out, but every time she tried to refuse, she remembered Chris's words and his constant gaze.

Maybe she had to make a fool of herself today to please Chris.

So she gritted her teeth and drank over ten glasses. The alcohol numbed her brain. Amelia's vision blurred, her cheeks flushed, and she leaned weakly against the sofa, her body tilting to the side.

But before she could completely fall, a large hand grabbed her shoulder and pulled her into an embrace.

The familiar scent of pine filled her nose. It belonged to Chris alone.
###Chapter 26

Chris glanced at Amelia, who was drunk and leaning against him, a flicker of something in his deep eyes.

But he snapped, "If you can't handle your booze, why do you drink? Are you nuts?"

Amelia immediately pulled away from him. Even though her head was spinning, she'd rather grab the sofa for support than lean on him again.

'I just scolded her once and she got all upset. How touchy,' Chris thought with a sneer.

He reached to take the glass of wine from in front of Amelia, but just then,Nolan stumbled over.

"Come on, Amelia, one last glass, I swear this is the final one. You've had a blast today. Once we finish this, we're outta here!"

Chris's expression darkéned as he shot a cold look at Nolan. But the already drunk Nolan didn't notice and kept urging Amelia to drink the last glass.

Amelia's mind was foggy, and the voices seemed distant. But in her drunken state, all she heard was "drink."

She quickly grabbed the glass and downed another shot of strong liquor.The burning sensation seared down her throat, making her already fragile stomach worse. In seconds, she went from feeling nauseous to actually throwing up. And she puked all over Chris.

The whole room fell into an awkward silence, again.
Even Chris took a moment to realize there was a stain on his thigh,reeking of alcohol. His borderline OCD made him wrinkle his brow, barely containing his anger.

"Amelia!" He gave her a shove, only to see her collapse instantly.Her hands, which had been gripping the sofa tightly, now slackened, causing her to fall sideways.

"Chris, chill out. I mean, don't do anything crazy. Killing is illegal; we're all law-abiding citizens," Nolan cautiously advised him.

The others didn't have such guts; all they could do was try to get out of this tense situation as quickly as possible.

When Amelia woke up again, Chris and his friends were gone.

She was in an unfamiliar hotel, the bed was clean, and she was wearing a new dress. But her whole body was sore and weak, which she thought was a hangover from the alcohol.

She felt like something must have happened last night,but she couldn't recall. Until she stood in front of the mirror and saw the hickeys all over her neck, extending down to her collarbone. Fragmented passionate scenes from last night flashed in her mind instantly.

She blushed with shame and anger. Chris, that jerk, how was she supposed to go out now?

Meanwvhile,in Chris's office.

"Mr. Spencer, Ms. Ross is here," assistant Ryder reminded him. "She says she has something urgent to discuss with you."

Chris didIn't respond; he quietly stared at the documents on thetable,not
moving for a long time.

Ryder was a bit taken aback,as he couldn't recall a time when Chris had ever been lost in thought.

"Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer?" Ryder called softly a few times.

Chris suddenly snapped out of it.

All morning. his mind had been filled with images of Amelia's wet blue eyes and sweet red lips.

Unlike the last time, this time, due to the influence of alcohol, Amelia was unusually cooperative, her melodious and enticing moans escaping her lips.Her sexy body had an alluring glow, making it impossible for him to stop.The feeling from last night was so wonderful that even now, he couldn't calm down. After coming back to his senses, Chris cleared his throat twice."What did you just say?"

Ryder repeated his words.

Chris said, "Let her in."

Moments later, Leila appeared before him. This usually glamorous woman now looked particularly disheveled, her chin and shoulders slumped.

As soon as she saw Chris, she pitifully said, "Chris, I finally got to see you.You have no idea how unlucky I've been lately. All those endorsements you got for me have been taken away, and even the production of my new song release has been ddelayed."

Chris didn't even glance at her. He knew exactly why. He stepped out just to keep Leila too busy to bother him. "In light of the fact that you saved me once before, I can help you this time. But if you provoke Lucius again.
you're on your own," Chris said indifferently.

Leila was stunned. "Lucius? What do you mean?"

Chris glanced at her. Did she still not know why her career was struggling?Being this dumb, no wonder she couldn't become famous no matter how many resources she asked for.


"But I've never offended Lucius Howard." Leila suddenly stopped mid-sentence.


She remembered that time at Luacius's birthday party when she had someone ruin Amelia's dress, almost causing her to be humiliated in public.

In an instant, all the truth became clear.

Indeed, if Amelia had been humiliated at that time, it would have affected Sapphire and, indirectly, tarnished Lucius's reputation as well.

"Now you understand?" Chris said with a cold smile. "If you can't afford to offend someone, stay away from them. Don't do stupid things, and don't provoke Amelia again."

Instantly,jealousy and hatred filled Leila's eyes.

Leila thought,'Why was that bitch Amelia everywhere, and why didn't she just die!

Leila softened her voice, full of hope. "Chris, you promised to marry me before. Now that you're divoreing Amelia, when will we go register our marriage?"

Chris frowned, feeling an undeniable sense of repulsion he could no longer ignore. Was he resisting divorcing Amelia?
Chris said, "Grandpa won't agree."

Mentioning Victor, Leila forced a smile. "But this time, it's Amelia insisting on the divorce. I went to see her last time, trying to persuade her to reconcile with you and not upset you anymore, but she insisted on the divorce."


She raised her phone and played a recording of Amelia's words from that day in the private room. "Fine, if you can convince Chris to go to City Hall,of course, I'll be willing to leave him." The cold voice echoed clearly in the office,and Chris's face darkened, his eyes filled with a hint of anger.
###Chapter 27

Leila, totally clueless about Chris's feelings, blurted out, "Chris, Amelia totally played you back then. You forgave her, and she didn't even care.The second she found someone else, she demanded a divorce. I've seen her getting cozy with other guys more than once. She probably cheated on you already. She's dragging your name and the Spencer family through the mud by still calling herself Mrs. Spencer."


"Shut up!" Chris snapped, his voice icy.

"Chris, you..." Leila was taken aback but tried to show her understanding,"I'm just upset for you. If it were me, I'd never betray you. I'd treasure this marriage."

"Would you?" Chris's face was unreadable.

Tears welled up in her eyes, making her look pitiful. "Chris, I love you so much! I have a long scar on my body from saving you, and I don't regret it. I'd do anything to marry you."

Chris suddenly sneered, "But four years ago, you made me promise to marry you in return for saving my life, and I agreed. Then youinsisted on going abroad and gave up that chance. Now, you'd better shut up, or you can get out of the country."

"I had my reasons back then, Chris. I saved you; you can't be so cruel to me!" Leila desperately tried to grab Chris's hand but was harshly pushed away.

His brown eyes were cold."It's true that you saved me. Otherwise, do you think you'd still be standing here talking to me?"
Sophia couldn't stand seeing Amelia always stressed about making money to pay off debts. So, on the weekend, she dragged Amelia out shopping to get some new clothes.

"Miss, we have all the latest styles," the sales assistant greeted them warmly.

Sophia tried on a few outfits but felt a bit disappointed. Noticing that Amelia sited the clothes better, she encouraged her to try on several more outfits while she waited outside.

"Miss, would you like to try our store's free manicure?" the sales assistant suggested, pointing inside. "To kill time."

Sophia looked at her nails, tempted but hesitant, "I'm afraid she'll come out before I'm done."

The sales assistant smiled even brighter. "Then ask her to get the nails done too. Our styles are better than some nail salons out there."

Sophía couldn't resist and followed the sales assistant inside.

"Remind her to come over when she's done trying on clothes," Sophia said.


The sales assistant agreed.

Meanwhile, Amelia had already vanished.

"Did she faint?" a woman asked urgently.

A man nodded, "Don't worry, I put three times the usual dose of sedative on that towel. She'll be out for a day!"
They quickly escorted Amelia through the mall's staff passage, moving so fast that no one noticed.

By the time Amelia woke up,it was already very late.

"Is anyone there?" She was alone, tied up on a sofa in an empty room,unable to free her hands or feet.


No response.

Most importantly, Amelia felt groggy, and all she could do was wait. After all, unless they planned to let her die here, the kidnappers would eventually show up.

Time passed slowly, and the room grew darker. The late autumn night was freezing. Amelia shivered from the cold.

Suddenly,footsteps approaiched. Someone was coming.

Amelia perked up, staring at the door.

The person unlocked the door with a key and walked in heavily.

At first glance, Amelia saw a tall, muscular figure with a masked face.

It was clear this was a powerful man, and now, men meant danger to her.


"Who are you?" Amelia tried to stay calm. "Who sent you here?"

"You woke up so quickly; it's truly surprising." The man sneered,stepping forward to touch Amelia's face, sighing regretfully, "Bitch, it's a pity that I can't sleep with you."

Amelia instinctively wanted to retreat but couldn't move, only able to watch as the man untied the rope behind her and lifted her up.
"Let's go." He looked at her with a mocking smile, "Aren't you afraid I'll rape you right here as you keep glaring at me?"

Of course,she was afraid, but what good would that do?

Amelia didn't say another word, racking her brain to figure out who had trapped her. Could it be one of Chris's enemies?

But in the vast upper-class circle of Pinecrest, everyone knewv she was just a neglected poor soul. If anyone wanted revenge on Chris, wouldn't they target his most important person? Or was it an enemy of her parents?

Amelia was nervous, but she had to adapt to the situation. Hopefully,things wouldn't get too bad.

The man roughly pushed her out, and then Amelia realized she was in a large, abandoned amusement park. The rides were weathered and broken,and she could almost see the past prosperity at a glance.

The room Amelia was held in was the ticket booth, but the windows were sealed with iron sheets, making it impossible to see outside.

"Go; what are you looking at? Do you want to run? No way!" The man glared at her coldly, pushing her towards a van parked not far away.

Amelia's hands were tied, and with the push, she lost her balance and fell to the ground,getting covered in dirt.

"Stop pretending. Get up; stop dawdling!!" The man cursed,yanking her up roughly.

"I can give you money!" Amelia gritted her teeth, forcing out the words. "I'Il get a million dollars for you. Just let me go, and I..."
"Shut up!" The man slapped her face and mocked,"Do you think I'mpoor and need your pocket change?"

"How much do you want? No matter how much, I can find a way!"Amelia was unwilling, sensing that once she was in that van, escaping would be nearly impossible. She had to think of a way to escape now.

"Or tell me what you want, and I can help you." Amelia was unusually calm, trying to think of aplan.

Who sent him to kidnap her, and what did the mastermind want? She had never made enemies, and the only ones who could be considered enemies were Chris and Leila.

"Do you have money? Are you going to sell yourself again? Selling yourself to get money for me; you're such a lowly woman! I don't know why Chris married you in the first place." The man was full of insults.

But Amelia caught the key points in his words.

"You know Chris; you're Leila's man?" She stared at the only exposed eyes under his mask, shouting, "Leila sent you to kidnap me. What does she want? You assisted her; eventually, you will be implicated."

She even felt that this person was Ace, Leila's most loyal helper.

"Shut your filthy mouth!" The man shouted.

"Ace, I know it's you," Amelia sneered,"I am telling you I'll get back at both of you, unless you have the guts to kill me!"

The man got enraged, raising his hand to slap her, but was stopped by someone getting out of the van. "What are you dawdling for? Hurry up!"
###Chapter 28
Amelia woke up to the rhythmic sound of waves crashing against steel. Her head throbbed—she had been ambushed after leaving the restaurant and had lost consciousness. As her vision cleared, she realized she was trapped on the deck of a massive cargo ship, her wrists bound. A few feet away, Leila Ross sat in a similar state, her expensive dress ruined by the spray of the sea.
They were near the railing, the choppy waves of the Atlantic churning just below them. The shore was a distant, unreachable line of gray a thousand feet away.
"Amelia, you pathetic curse! Look what you’ve done to us! Why are you always dragging people into your mess?" Leila shrieked, her voice cracking with terror.
As if on cue, the sky bruised into a dark purple, and a torrential rain began to pour, soaking them instantly. The wind whipped Amelia’s hair across her face, but she remained eerily calm. She turned her gaze toward Leila, whose face was ghostly pale.
"Stop the act, Leila," Amelia said, her voice steady despite the cold. "You arranged this with Ace, didn't you? You wanted a stage to play the victim. So why are you screaming now?"
Surprise flashed in Leila’s eyes for a fraction of a second before it was replaced by a mask of indignation. "You’ve finally lost your mind! Why would I put my own life at risk just to deal with a nobody like you?"
Just then, a man in a dark tactical jacket stepped onto the deck, a smug grin on his face. He seemed entertained by their bickering. "Save your energy," he sneered. "Neither of you is going anywhere until the debt is settled."
Leila turned her tear-filled eyes to him. "Who are you? I have nothing to do with her! Let me go, and my family will pay you ten times whatever she owes!"
"Quiet!" The man stepped forward, his shadow looming over her. "You’re the one Chris Spencer actually values, aren't you? That makes you a very expensive guest."
Amelia watched the exchange, her mind working quickly. She knew this was Leila’s gambit—a staged kidnapping to force Chris into a final, public choice. Leila wanted Amelia to watch as Chris chose his first love over his wife, shattering Amelia’s spirit once and for all. It was a cruel, perfect plan.
Is it worth all this? Amelia wondered. Chris doesn't care about me. He never has.
Meanwhile, on the shore, a sleek black sedan sat hidden among the trees. Inside, Lucius Howard watched the scene through high-powered binoculars, a laptop glowing on his lap.
"Mr. Howard, it seems Miss Tudor has already unraveled the scheme," his assistant noted.
Lucius’s lips curved into a faint, intrigued smile. "She’s smarter than people give her credit for. But being smart won't stop the storm."
"Chris has arrived," the assistant added.
The roar of an off-road engine echoed along the coastline. Chris Spencer climbed out of the vehicle, his tall figure looking imposing even against the backdrop of the raging sea. When his gaze landed on Amelia, standing precariously on the rain-slicked deck, his jaw tightened. A flash of something—anger, or perhaps a rare moment of fear—crossed his eyes.
He didn't hesitate. Ordering his men into a waiting yacht, he sped toward the ship.
Four armed men appeared on the deck as the yacht approached. The man in the black jacket stepped to the railing, looking down at Chris.
"Mr. Spencer! You’re just in time for the finale," the kidnapper shouted over the wind. "A hundred million for each of them. A small price for the women in your life, right?"
"Chris, save me!" Leila wailed, her voice reaching a pitch of pure desperation. "I'm so scared!"
In contrast, Amelia closed her eyes, letting the rain wash over her. She didn't call out. She didn't plead. Her silence seemed to infuriate Chris more than Leila's screams. He hated that even now, she refused to depend on him.
"Make your choice, Spencer!" the man in the jacket challenged, his hand hovering over the release mechanism of the gate. "The storm is getting worse. Who do we bring in first? The one you choose is safe. The other... well, the sea is very deep today."
The air was thick with the scent of salt and tension. Chris stood on the bow of his yacht, his brown eyes locked onto Amelia’s frail, silent form. The choice wasn't just about money; it was a public declaration of his heart, and the entire world was watching.
###Chapter 29

"Do I have to choose?" Chris's voice wasn't loud, but it was clear enough for everyone to hear. "You might not get my methods; I hate being threatened. Let them go, and I'll let you live."

As he spoke, Chris raised his hand slightly, and yachts started closing in from all directions.

The roaring engines were deafening as they surrounded the not-so-large ship.

Amelia's eyes narrowed. His actions would definitely piss off the kidnappers, and they still had the hostages.

Sure, he might not care about her, but what about Leila?

"Mr. Spencer, maybe you shouldn't be so sure of yourself." The sudden actions left the kidnappers a bit rattled, and one of them grabbed Leila's hair.

Leila winced, her face twisted in pain, cursing inwardly, 'What kind of kidnappers did Ace find? Why aren't they grabbing Amelia's hair instead?'

"Chris, I'm so scared..." She looked at Chris with pitiful eyes.

The kidnapper smirked, "Isn't she your first love? Don't you feel sorry for her? I'll count to three. If you don't choose by then, say goodbye to both of them."


Chris's eyes were icy as he stared.

Under his intense, murderous gaze, the kidnapper, feeling like death was near, started the countdown anyway.
"Three!"

"Save me, Chris. I don't want to die here before marrying you." Even though Leila knew it was all an act, the kidnapper's performance was too convincing, and she screamed in fear.

In the pouring rain, Amelia's vision was already blurry.

She furrowed her brows slightly, but her expression remained calm, despite the panic of temporary blindness she concealed in her heart. Her hair clung to her face, her thin clothes looking particularly disheveled.

Several sharks circled below, ready to strike at any moment.

Amelia knew deep down, Chris would never choose her...

"Chris, do you remember the first time I saw you? You were pinned under a car, unable to move, and the car was about to explode. I struggled to save you, and my arm was deeply cut by the car window. But I didn't care.When you promised to marry me, I felt that even if I had scars for a lifetime,it would be worth it!" Leila wept as she recalled the past.

Chrís's deep eyes suddenly tightened, remembering the gentle encouragement that had kept him going through the accident when he was unconscious.


This was what he owed Leila.

Chris lowered his gaze and looked at Amelia. She closed her eyes.adopting an indifferent demeanor, which ignited a surge of anger within him.

This woman's scheme was so clumsy, was she treating him like a fool?
"Mr. Spencer, it has been verified that it was indeed the kidnappers contacted by Mrs. Spencer," his assistant whispered.

Chris sneered. Just a moment ago, he had some doubts, but now he was certain.


This despicable woman, Amelia, in her bid to secure Mrs. Spencer's position, had resorted to staging a kidnapping.

A sinister thought suddenly crossed his mind. If Amelia's plan failed,would she just obediently stay at home as she used to?

As the kidnapper counted down to the last second, he coldly said, "Mr.Spencer,are you so heartless as to not choose anyone? Then both of these people will die."

The kidnapper smirked and approached the stern as he picked up a knife,about to cut the rope.

The sharks in the water also seemed eager, as if they might lunge at any moment.

Chris's eyes turned cold. "I choose her."

The kidnapper asked, "Who is she, your wife or your lover?"

Up to this point, Amelia stayed silent. She couldn't see a thing,waiting for her fate with a mix of sorrow and calmness. It didn't matter.Maybe after today,she'd finally be free.

Chris clenched his teeth, a murderous glint in his eyes. "Leila, let her go first!"

"Did you hear that? Let me go" Leila shouted, her tone shifting. She
looked ecstatically at the silent Amelia beside her, trembling with excitement.

"Amelia, you're no match for me at all. Chris chose me!" Leila was over the moon. The pain she had just endured seemed to vanish.

"I knew." Amelia finally spoke, with a bitter smile and a numb tone.

This whole thing was a joke. So, should she, this poor and pitiful tool,just exit the stage?

She slowly raised her head, her blurred vision still able to make out the figure on the yacht, tall and upright. The man she had loved for over a decade had chosen another woman, abandoning her. Even though she had already made her peace, the pain was still overwhelming.

This was for the best because they were now completely clear between them. The boy who once smiled so radiantly had saved her life once. She would now return the favor by giving her life for his...

But in that instant, a gunshot rang out.

Everyone shuddered,trying to find who had been shot.

It was then discovered that a rope on one side had been pierced, and Amelia's frail body fell, instantly engulfed in the deep bluesea.

"Amelia!"

In the distance, a roar seemed to be heard.

But Amelia could no longer hear anything. Her ears were filled with seawater, the icy cold ocean enveloping her, tearing at her and pounding her. With a violent surge of waves, she was thrown into deeper waters.
A severe sense of suffocation took over as she struggled frantically,but it was futile. In extreme pain, the whole world suddenly became heavy and quiet.

On the yacht, Chris's eyes tightened. The figure falling into the sea seemed to shake his heart, causing panic.

Without hesitation, he took off his coat and leaped into the sea.

"Mr. Spencer!" His subordinates were shocked.


Even Lucius, who had been silently watching from a distance,squinted in surprise.

"It seems Mr. Spencer's love for Amelia is genuine, to risk his life to save her," his assistant remarked meaningfully.

Lucius sighed heavily. "Yes, I never expected that."

But what ability did that Amelia possess to make Chris act so recklessly?


"You must dispatch more personnel to ensure her rescue before Chris locates Amelia," he deliberated for a moment before giving the order.

The assistant nodded, "Mr. Howard, rest assured, I already have lifeguards on standby."

The sea winds and waves grew stronger.

The moment Chris plunged into the sea, the frigid and salty water stung his eyes, making it impossible to keep them open. Struggling as he descended,he realized he couldn't see any trace of Amelia. He repeatedly dived into the sea, tirelessly searching, then surfaced for air.

His men began a large-scale search of the area, but Amelia was nowhere to
be found.

After Chris's legs went numb and his strength depleted, his panic grew as he stared out at the endless ocean.

Damn it, wasn't it Amelia, the foolish woman who planned this kidnapping? Why would she take such a risk herself?

"Mr. Spencer, a storm is brewing. We can't stay here any longer!" His assistant shouted, throwing down a lifebuoy and a rope that he could grab with his hand.

But all Chris could think about was that stubborn figure. Without a second thought, he dove into the sea once more.
###Chapter 30

Amelia's head pounded like a drum, and her whole body felt like it was on fire. She could hear some voices, but they were all muffled.

She slowly opened her eyes, and the first thing she saw were the blinding white walls. The smell of disinfectant hit her nose. Was she in heaven?


"You're awake?" Lucius asked softly. "How are you feeling?"

Amelia blinked, confused. "Why are you here?"

Lucius didn't answer. Instead, he called the doctor to check on her.

After the doctor said she needed to stay in the hospital for observation,
Lucius sighed. "My guys found you and brought you here."

Amelia looked down. She thought she was a goner, but here she was, alive.

"You're pregnant," Lucius said out of nowhere.

Amelia's eyes went wide. "What? How is that even possible?"

Lucius kept his gentle smile. "Why not? It's only been a little over a month.
You probably didn't notice. After everything you've been through,it's a miracle the baby is okay."

Amelia's mind went blank. She'd only slept with Chris once. Could she be pregnant from just that one time?

"Think about it," Lueius said, seeing her struggle to process it. "If you need anything, just let me know."

He glanced at her right arm, where a faint scar was visible. "BTW, can you tell me how you got that scar?"
Amelia, still dazed, replied, "When I was a teenager, I got it saving someone."

"Be more specific," Lucius pressed.

"Two people were kidnapped. The kidnappers were going to kill them and crash the car to make it look like an accident. I happened to pass by and saved them," she explained.

"How did you save them?" Lucius asked, his voice low.

"I remember I first saved the boy who was unconscious, dragged him to a hidden tree, and then went back to save the other person, but I got burned in the process. That's how I got the scar."

It had been so long, she couldn't remember clearly. She had an appointment at the time and didn't see the faces of the people she saved.She left quickly when the ambulance arrived.

She didn't notice the change in Lucius's expression. "What's wrong?" she asked, sensing his unusual interest.

"Nothing," Lucius said, standing up to leave.

Amelia clutched the sheet."Wait."

Lucius turned back to her.

"Why are you helping me?" she asked.

Lucius's gaze darkened, his eyes filled with complexity. "Maybe it's fate,"he said heavily.

Amelia's mind was a mess. Lucius and Chris had always been at odds. He saved her, so he must have a reason.
But he did save her life.

He'd been the kindest to her during this whole ordeal.

But now, what should she do?

She was pregnant, the baby just a month old, yet incredibly resilient.Despite the accident, it had survived.

Amelia instinctively touched her belly,'tears falling.

This was Chris's child, growing inside her. He definitely wouldn't want it.But it was also her child. That thought touched her heart.

She wanted to keep this baby, even if it meant pissing off Chris. She wanted to show this little one the world.


With her mind made up, the next time Lucius visited, Amelia made a request. "Mr. Howard, I know I don't have the right to ask for anything,but I need your help to get out of here. Once I safely deliver the baby and get settled, I'll be at your service whenever you need me."

For the first time, there was a spark in her eyes.

Lucius looked at her quietly, surprised she had made up her mind so quickly.

She seemed different now, no longer the weak and pitiful girl she had been."Are you sure?" Lucius's lips curved slightly.

Amelia nodded, her gaze steady. "I want to keep this baby.I'll take good care of him."


"Alright, as you wish," He smiled faintly.
Outside the room, Lucius told his assistant, "Check if Amelia was in that small town after Chris and I were kidnapped years ago."

Eleven years ago, he was in his twenties, full of youthful arrogance, while Chris, at sixteen, was already showing signs of rebellion. They didn't get along well, so they decided to settle it with a race, but ended up getting kidnapped. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of two hundred million dollars and drugged them, taking them to a remote town. Then they were rescued and taken by an ambulance.


Lucius remembered someone saving them, but the family had covered it up. He figured the family must have rewarded the people who saved them with a huge amount of money.


And over the years, he had been too busy to think about it.




Hospital days dragged on. Amelia hadn't had such a simple life in a long time.


If it were before, she would have longed for these carefree days. But now,she felt lost.

Once she recovered, she planned to leave the city, end all the painful disputes, settle her father, and find a new place to start over. Thinking about it, the future seemed worth looking forward to.

But this peace only lasted a week.

One day, Lucius came to the hospital with shocking news.

"Yes, you heard right. Chris is hospitalized, still in a coma," Lucius repeated.
Amelia stood there, her back stiff. "How could this be? He was fine;how could he be hospitalized?"

Hearing about Chris, she felt conflicted. She didn't want to care, but she couldn't help it.

"I need to tell you the truth, then you can reconsider leaving." Lucius hesitated, then took out his phone and showed her a photo.

Amelia's hands trembled as she took it.

The person lying motionless in the photo was Chris, his eyes closed,face pale, lips bloodless. Her heart ached inexplicably.

Amelia found it hard to believe.

Could it be that Chris, always so strong and invincible, would be so helpless,lying unconscious in a hospital bed?

"What happened to him?" Her throat was dry, her voice hoarse.

Lucius adjusted his glasses and sighed, "That day, afteryou fell into the sea,he jumped in without hesitation, diving again and again to find you.Eventually, he was swept into the open sea by the waves and attacked by a shark... Amelia, he was seriously injured."
###Chapter 31

"No way, this is impossible!" Amelia's face went ghostly white,and she almost crumpled to the floor.

She stared at him, wide-eyed, "Mr. Howard, I trust you completely. If you said the sky was green, I'd believe you. But this..."

She shook her head, tears streaming down her cheeks.

How could it be true?

For three years, Chris had been humiliating her. And every single day, he and everyone else kept telling her that he didn't love her.

But now,Lucius was saying Chris had jumped into the sea for her and got seriously hurt.

"You might not believe it, but it's the truth," Lucius said, not surprised by her reaction.


"Or you could check your phone. The news is all over the place; you just haven't been keeping up."

Saying she wasn't keeping up was an understatement; she hadn't even turned on her phone in days.

"Mr. Howard, can I trust you?" Amelia's hands were shaking. She took a deep breath and looked at the composed Lucius,feeling lost.

Lucius smiled gently, "That's up to you, not me."

Amelia finally lost all her strength and collapsed onto the sofa.

"Maybe he still cares about you," Lucius said in a deep, convincing voice.
Amelia was in a daze for a long time before she suddenly looked up, "Mr.Howard, I'm sorry, I suddenly feel very unwell and can't talk to you anymore. Could you please leave?"

Her long-held beliefs had shattered, and she needed time to process it.

After Lucius left, Amelia charged her phone and turned it on.

Messages flooded in. Many people had called and texted her, but Amelia ignored them all. She opened various news apps and found that the reports were consistent: Chris was indeed injured and hospitalized.

Her heart was in turmoil.

At this moment, her phone rang. It was Victor.

"Amelia, thank goodness you finally turned on your phone. Where are you? Come back immediately, Chris's condition is terrible, you..."

"Which hospital is he in? I'll go see him right away." She cut him off,anxious.


A few minutes later, she changed her clothes and stepped out of her ward.

"Please tell Mr. Howard that my plan will be postponed for now," Amelia said to one of Lucius's subordinates.

She took a cab straight to the Spencer family's private hospital, where Victor's subordinates met her outside.

"Grandpa!" The moment she saw Victor, Amelia's tears flowed freely.

"Dear, I've finally gotten to see you. How are you? I heard about the incident that day. Were you rescued? What has happened these past few days?" Victor turned her around to check her over, and seeing that she
had no obvious injuries, he finally felt a bit relieved.

"I'm fine, someone saved me. I've been resting these days. Grandpa, I want to see Chris," Amelia said urgently.


"Mr. Spencer, get her out of here!" Suddenly, a sharp female voice came from the end of the hallway.


It was Leila.

"This is all her scheme. If it weren't for her, Chris wouldn't have had an accident. It's all because of her, she's a jinx!"

Leila was angrily accusing before she even walked over, her voice sharp and loud.


Victor's face became grim, "Ms. Ross, you seem to have forgotten that Amelia is Chris's wife."


Leila, who had clearly promised him not to come back, had gone back on her word, which was truly despicable.

"But I'm the one who has been taking care of him these days. I can't just stand by and watch Chris get hurt by her again!" Leila threw down what she was holding and strode over.

"Enough." Victor's gaze darkened.

The butler beside him immediately said, "Ms. Ross, if you continue to obstruct Ms. Spencer, we will have to ask you to leave."

Leila was stunned, gritting her teeth in frustration, "Mr. Spencer, Chris chose to save me that day,he should..."

"Ms. Ross, you have no right to say these things in front of me." Victor
gave her a meaningful look, his gaze piercing.

Leila stiffened, recalling the incident from a few years ago,and swallowed her words.

But she thought to herself, even if she had taken the money and left back then, so what? Chris loved her. Now that she was back, she had to reclaim her lover, and no one could stop her.

Meanwhile, Amelia had already entered the ward.

"Chris." Amelia's breath caught the moment she saw Chris.

It turned out that the photos didn't do justice to the real thing. The person lying on the hospital bed looked nothing like the Chris she knew.

Amelia even thought this must be some cruel prank to make her a laughingstock.

But it was Chris, and he was seriously injured.

Amelia stood still for a long time before she could accept this and slowly walked over.


"Chris." She called out in a trembling voice, but there was no response.

He was thinner and more haggard, his face sharply defined, making her heart ache.

"Grandpa, how is he? What did the doctor say?" Amelia rushed out to ask Victor.

Victor sighed, "He was bitten by a shark on his leg, and there are torn wounds on his chest and back. Plus, he was in the sea for a long time,leading to his coma. The doctor said he needs at least one or two months
of treatment to wake up."

Amelia's mind went blank, and she was completely stunned.

"Amelia, stay and take care of him, okay? Although your relationship was a bit strained before, it's normal for couples to argue occasionally. He needs you now," V/ictor said softly.

Amelia knew she wouldn't be able to leave for a while.

She forced a smile and nodded, "I see, Grandpa. You should go rest. I'll handle things here."

Victor was also very tired, sustained only by his worry. Now that Amelia was here,he could finally relax a bit.

"Amelia, you fell into the sea, why aren't you dead? Why did you come back? Getout of here right now!" As soon as Victor left, Leila appeared.

She crossed her arms and looked down at Amelia with resentment.

Amelia didn't argue with her. She quietly sat bythe bed,using a damp hot towel to wipe Chris's hands.

His body was covered in thick bandages. She couldn't imagine how he had endured it.

"You bitch, I'm talking to you. Are you deaf or mute?" Leila was angry,then laughed, "Oh, right, you're almost blind, so it must be affecting your hearing too."

Amelia glanced at her indifferently, "Aren't you afraid I'll shout for the bodyguards to throw you out? Or tell them that you were the one who harmed Chris?"
Leila was unfazed, "All the evidence points to you. Even if you explain to others, no one would believe you."

"As long as Grandpa believes me, you would be kicked out." She paused,thinking that Chris might want Leila to stay, and said softly, "If you want to stay here,be quiet."

"I can stay as long as I want. It's not up to you!"

Amelia didn't want to argue anymore, "I don't want to be here with you..Since Grandpa agreed to let you stay,how about this: you take one day,and I'll take the next."

"No way, I have to see Chris every day!" Leila said angrily, "He's in this mess because of you. If he wakes up and sees you, he might faint again.".

"Either agree, or I'll tell Grandpa the truth." Amelia coldly left this sentence and walked out.

Leila was furious, her face turning pale, but she was afraid Amelia would go to Victor, so she reluctantly agreed.

At night, Amelia sat quietly on the sofa, looking through the photos she had locked in her phone.

They were all photos she had secretly taken of Chris.

She had started having a crush on him when she was very young.

Over the years, she had secretly taken hundreds of photos of him,mostly of his back, with a few side profiles.

These photos recorded all his stages from his teenage years to not long ago,from a young boy to a mature and cold man.
A tear suddenly fell from her eye.

Amelia was momentarily dazed.

Could it be that she hadn't been in total despair and that her love for him had rekindled?


But she was clearly deeply hurt.

Amelia wiped away her tears and told herself, this was the last time.

She didn't like owing favors. She would do this to repay him.
###Chapter 32
The next morning, Leila arrived at the hospital early. Her presence was as loud as her designer outfit. "You’ve done your part, Amelia. Now, step aside. You're just a reminder of things Chris wants to forget."
Amelia didn't argue. She moved to the small waiting room Victor had arranged for her. She had stayed up all night watching over Chris, and exhaustion was finally catching up.
Around noon, a nurse approached her and whispered, "Ms. Tudor, I noticed Ms. Ross taking numerous photos of Mr. Spencer while I was changing his dressings. She mentioned something about 'public relations' and private archives."
Amelia frowned. She hurried toward the ward, only to see Leila leaning dangerously close to Chris’s pale face, as if posing for a portrait of a devoted lover.
"Stop," Amelia said as she walked in.
Leila straightened up, looking entirely unbothered. "This isn't your concern. I’m the one he actually wants to see when he opens his eyes. Your presence might just delay his recovery."
Amelia swallowed the bitterness. "This is a hospital, Leila, not a movie set. If Victor’s people see you treating this room like a photo op, you’ll be escorted out."
Leila gave her a chilly look before turning back to Chris. Amelia took a deep breath and stepped back. Perhaps Leila was right—maybe Chris wouldn't want her to be the first thing he saw.
Days turned into weeks. Chris remained in a deep, unresponsive sleep. One afternoon, Victor arrived with a specialist. "Amelia, this is Dr. Alton King, a close associate of Lucius Howard."
Amelia shook hands with the doctor, a composed man in his thirties. "Thank you for coming, Dr. King."
"It’s no trouble. Lucius spoke highly of your dedication," Alton replied with a professional smile. After a thorough examination, he turned to the family. "Mr. Spencer’s physical injuries are healing well, but his cognitive response is stagnant. You need to talk to him. Stimulate his will to return."
In the following days, whenever the room was quiet, Amelia sat by his bedside.
"Chris, it’s ironic, isn't it?" she murmured one evening. "I spent three years trying to get you to listen to me, and now that you have no choice, I don't know what to say. Please wake up soon. I want to finalize our separation and start my own life. This hospital... it feels like another cage."
She talked about mundane things—the pasta she made in the hospital kitchen, her rehearsals at the restaurant, the sunlight through the window.
Who is speaking? My head... it burns.
In the darkness of his unconsciousness, Chris felt as if he were wandering through a frozen wasteland. But then, a voice—soft, persistent, and hauntingly familiar—began to pull him back.
Amelia?
He tried to reach for the sound. She’s alive? The sea was so cold... how did she survive? He listened as she spoke of her desire to leave him, of her tears hidden under the covers during their marriage, and of her small joys in the kitchen. Every word felt like a needle pricking his pride, but it was also the only light in his darkness.
"You’re handsome, I’ll give you that," he heard her whisper one afternoon. "No wonder Leila is so determined to keep you. You two are a perfect match in many ways. I should have stepped away a long time ago."
Chris felt a surge of irritation. How dare she decide who I belong with?
A while later, he heard her return with someone else. "Mr. Howard, I’ve been following the doctor’s advice, but there’s no change," Amelia sighed.
"Don't be so hard on yourself, Amelia," Lucius Howard’s gentle voice filled the room. "Chris is a stubborn man. He’ll wake up when he’s ready. In the meantime, you need to care for yourself too."
What is Howard doing here? Chris gritted his teeth in his mind. And why is she making him tea? She’s never made tea for me.
The sound of their quiet laughter and the aroma of fresh tea filled the room, fueling a fire in Chris’s chest that finally broke through the gray veil of his coma.

###Chapter 33
When Amelia returned from seeing Lucius out, she found Leila sitting by the bed, her arms crossed defiantly.
"Flirting with the employer while your husband lies in a coma? You really have no shame, Amelia," Leila sneered, her red dress vivid against the sterile white room.
"My personal life is none of your business, Leila," Amelia replied calmly, checking Chris’s monitor. She noticed his heart rate was fluctuating.
"You think you can move on to someone like Lucius Howard? You’re a Tudor—a name that’s synonymous with debt and scandal," Leila continued, her voice rising.
"Get out," Amelia said, her patience finally snapping. "Before I lose my temper."
Leila laughed, but her laughter was cut short by a sharp, rhythmic beeping from the heart monitor. Both women froze.
Chris’s eyes slowly fluttered open.
Leila was the first to react, rushing to his side and seizing his hand. "Chris! You're awake! Oh, thank God. I was so terrified... I didn't know how I’d go on without you."
Amelia stood at the foot of the bed, her heart racing. She saw Chris’s gaze settle on Leila, a flicker of something unreadable in his brown eyes.
"It's okay," Chris rasped, his voice raw from weeks of disuse. "Thank you... for being here."
Leila sobbed with relief, clinging to him. Amelia felt like an intruder in her own marriage. She turned to leave, wanting to give them space, but a cold, hoarse voice stopped her in her tracks.
"Stop."
Amelia froze. She turned back to see Chris looking at her. There was no warmth in his eyes—only a sharp, piercing intensity.
"Chris is awake, and you’re just going to walk away?" Leila snapped, standing up. "He nearly lost his life because of the situation you were involved in. Have you no gratitude?"
Amelia took a breath and stepped forward, bowing her head slightly in a gesture of sincere respect. "I am glad you are safe, Chris."
Chris’s expression remained stony. "A bow? That’s how you repay a debt of this magnitude?"
"What do you want from me, Mr. Spencer?" Amelia asked, her voice steady. "I’ll do whatever is required."
The doctors and nurses rushed in then, performing a flurry of checks. Throughout the entire process, Chris’s eyes never left Amelia. It wasn't the look of a husband; it was the look of a creditor watching his most valuable asset.
"Since you're so eager to be 'useful'," Chris said once the doctors had left, his voice regaining some of its former strength. "You will stay here. You will take care of my recovery personally. Only when I am back on my feet will I allow you to discuss leaving."
"Chris, I can take care of you," Leila protested.
"No," Chris said firmly. "This is her responsibility. She owes me this."
Amelia felt the weight of his words like a physical chain. "Fine," she whispered. "I’ll stay."
By the afternoon, the Spencer family had gathered. Victor was the only one Chris allowed into the room.
"You were impulsive, Chris," Victor scolded, though his eyes were red with relief. "Jumping into the ocean like that... what were you thinking?"
Chris leaned back against the pillows, looking exhausted. "I'm fine, Grandpa. Let’s not dwell on it."
Victor looked at Amelia, who was standing quietly in the corner. "Amelia, come here. Sit. You’ve worked harder than anyone these past few weeks."
Amelia moved forward, her gaze meeting Chris’s. The battle between them was far from over, but for now, the silence of the hospital had been replaced by a much louder, more complicated debt.

###Chapter 34

Amelia froze, her eyes instinctively darting to Chris.

He was leaning there, staring at her with a look that could kill, his thoughts a complete mnystery.


After a moment, she slowly walked over and sat next to Victor, making sure to keep her distance from Chris.

She didn't want to set him off.


"Come closer. It's thanks to you taking care of Chris day and night that he woke up," Victor, still strong despite his age, grabbed the armrest of her chair and pulled it over with her in it.

Amelia almost lost her balance and looked up in a panic, meeting Chris's mocking eyes.


He was staring at her again, like he wanted to eat her alive.

"Grandpa, I didn't really do much. He woke up because of his own willpower," she quickly looked away, not wanting to mneet those terrifying eyes.


Victor, however, looked very pleased, watching them with satisfaction."Everyone says you two aren't right for each other. They just don't see what I see. Look at you now, you're perfect together. I hope you two can get along well and don't repeat the previous mistakes."

Amelia's face stiffened, but she still nodded.

After finally seeing Victor off, Amelia stood outside the door, avoiding being alone with Chris.
"I want some water," Chris suddenly shouted.

Amelia instinctively responded, "Coming."

She felt confused. Why was she so obedient to him?

Maybe she had already been influenced by him.

Amelia kept telling herself that this was just a way to repay a favor.


She poured him a glass of warm water and thoughtfully prepared some snacks and fruit.

Chris glanced at her lazily and suddenly asked, "Who saved you back then?



The question was as casual as asking about the weather.

Amelia blurted out without thinking, "Mr. Howard's people."

No sooner were the words spoken than she realized her mistake.

But once the words were out, they couldn't be taken back.


The room instantly felt like it dropped ten degrees.

Chris squinted his eyes, looking at her with a dangerous glint. "When did you start hooking up with him? He even set up such a big plan for you?"

Amelia felt like a sword was hanging over her head, not knowing when it would fall and take her life.

"I didn't," her voice trembled.

Knowing that explaining was futile, she still couldn't help it.
"Oh,did you?" Chris's gaze grew darker, "Then why would he help you to this extent? Did you sleep with him?"

"Bullshit!" Amelia's cheeks flushed with anger, "I didn't!"

She could endure his humiliation towards herself, but she couldn't tolerate him insulting others, especially Lueius, who had helped her many times.

"You're protective of him. What's so good about him? He saved you because he was there waiting to see the drama between you and me. You foolishly think he really cares about you. He's just using you,you idiot!"He was already losing his temper.

"So what?" Amelia gritted her teeth, shouting angrily, "At least he didn't hurt me."


Chris was stunned, silent for a moment before saying,"With your limited understanding, someone could swindle you, and you'd still thank them."

"If you keep talking nonsense, I'll leave." Amelia turned her back to him,showing her determination, "I have already done my duty by taking care of you these days. Besides, I didn't ask you to save me back then."

She was devastated; every word he said was like a dagger to her heart.

"Amelia!" Chris's face turned pale, each word cutting deeper, "Even a dog knows to wag its tail at the person who gives it a bone."

"But I'm not a dog." Amelia smiled bitterly, "If you want a dog, there are plenty outside."

She had become numb to such venomous words. Why did she still harbor hope?
Suddenly, she felt a sharp pain in her shoulder.

She was startled and instinctively turned around, only to see him pounce from the bed, already standing behind her.

His eyes were deep, filled with a terrifying cold light.

His hand was gripping her shoulder, almost crushing it.

"What did you say?" He stared at her intently.

Amelia's heart tightened immediately.

A dull pain came over her, making her breathless.

His face was pale, his body visibly trembling.


Amelia was worried, "Your wounds haven't healed yet, how can you get out of bed?"


As she spoke, she had supported his arm, trying to help him back to bed.

The hospital gown on his thigh was soaked with blood from his wound,and his chest was also faintly bleeding.

"Are you worried about me?" Chris's lips curved slightly.

"Stop talking, you're bleeding. Lie down, I'll get the doctor to change your dressing."

"You change it for me!" Chris grabbed her arm, not letting her go,his attitude particularly harsh.

Amelia frowned, "How can I do that? I'm not a nurse."

"You do it." Chris used a commanding tone, "Didn't you always want to
look after me? I'm giving you a chance, don't be ungrateful."

"But I'm afraid of hurting you." Amelia was helpless. "Why don't you let the doctor change it? I'm concerned I'll..." She wasn't a professional nurse;what if something went wrong?

"Cut the crap." His voice trembled, carrying an undeniable authority.

At this point, why was he still putting on airs?

Amelia had no choice but to brace herself.

She first unbuttoned his shirt. The wounds on his upper body weren't too severe, mostly superficial, but there was a deep one under his armpit near his ribs, the wound a shocking black-red, exuding a bloody smell.

Was this a shark bite?

Amelia could almost imagine the scene of him fighting a shark. She didn't know how he survived.

The words she had just said seemed excessive.

"Are you dead?" Chris impatiently scolded, urging her to hurry up.

Amelia quickly used iodine cotton to clean the bloodstain around his wound.

Even though she was extremely careful, when her hand touched his body.he gasped, showing a suppressed look of pain.

"Sorry, are you okay?" Her eyes turned red, her voice weak.

Chris looked at her, inexplicably feeling she had returned to how she was when she wasn't asking for a divorce, when she wasn't trying to leave him.
"Not dead." He said gruffly, "Hurry up, don't waste time."

Amelia didn't argue, being even more careful and cautious, finally changing the dressing on his upper body.

But he had another wound on his leg, more severe, which was close to his groin.

Amelia tried to cut his pants but found it would be easier to just take them off.

If she accidentally cut something she shouldn't, it would be very embarrassing.

"What about calling the nurse to change the dressing here?" She asked.
###Chapter 35

With that, she was about to get up.

But Chris grabbed her arm. "Stop talking crap, just change it!"

Amelia bit her lip, trying to stay calm.

In the end, she gave in and looked at-his crotch, feeling a bit helpless."
Why don't you take it off yourself first, and then I'll..."

"Then why do I need you?" His words hit her like a bucket of cold water.

Even though he said that, Amelia still felt embarrassed, and her expression turned awkward.

"Let me help you up first," she said. "Otherwise, I can't take it off."

Chris's face suddenly darkened.

But strangely, he cooperated, using her outstretched hand to slowly and cautiously stand up.

Amelia went to unbutton his pants.

But she had never done such a thing before, and after fumbling for a long time, she still couldn't figure out how to undo the damn button.

For some inexplicable reason, his genitals seemed to have changed a bit.

"Enough! What are you fumbling around for?" He suddenly swatted her hand away. "You're so stupid,go out and get the nurse to change it."

Alright, he was the one who wanted her to change it, and now he refused to do it.
Amelia had no choice but to walk out to get a nurse.

She didn't expect to see Leila.

Leila's face was livid, glaring straight at her.

Leila was holding a thermos box, obviously having made a loving lunch for Chris.


Amelia couldn't quite describe her feelings and decided to ignore her.

"Amelia, stop right there." Leila's voice was low but urgent. "What were you just doing?"

Because of her anger, her tone had changed, making it particularly harsh.

Amelia guessed that she must have seen something through the small window on the door.


"How could you be such a whore, doing that for him..." Leila couldn't finish her sentence, glaring at Amelia as if she wanted to tear her apart.

Amelia realized that she had misunderstood.

"What,do you want to try too?" She didn't bother to explain, knowing Leila wouldn't believe her. "You can go ahead."

"You..." Leila was so angry her face turned grim.

Before she could finish her sentence, Amelia had already left,leaving behind a frail figure.

She had been stifled in the ward with Chris all morning, feeling awful, so she took the opportunity to walk in the garden downstairs to relieve her mood.
"Amelia." Lucius's voice came from not far away.

Amelia was stunned for a moment, then turned to see Lucius approaching.

"Mr. Howard, what brings you here?" She was a bit surprised. Didn't he get along poorly with Chris? Why was he here?

"My father asked me to come by when I had time, and I also have some business to discuss with Chris. Why aren't you upstairs?"

His voice was gentle and elegant, very soothing.

Amelia thought that Lucius and Chris were two extremes, one irritable and easy to get angry, the other always emotionally stable.

These two were born to be at odds.

"The doctor is changing his dressing, so I came out for a walk," Amelia explained.

"How have you been feeling lately? Have you told Chris about your pregnancy?" Lucius asked.

The question was too direct and Amelia didn't know how to answer for a moment.

She instinctively touched her lower abdomen, where a lovely little baby was growing, her future family, possibly her only one.

"I'll tell him in a few days. Mr. Howard, please keep it a secret for me,"she said.

Lucius smiled. "Of course."

He looked at her quietly. It was hard to imagine that such a weak girl had
saved them both at a critical moment.

But she didn't even know that the people she saved were them.

Fate sure has a funny way of working things out.

After their chat, he handed her a gray folder. "I'm not going upstairs.Please pass it to him."


Amelia sat downstairs for quite a while. She knew Chris would lose his temper if she still stayed here. So she slowwly made her way upstairs.

"Mr. Spencer, this is fromMr.Howard..."

As soon as she opened the door, she was shocked by the scene in front of her.


Leila was feeding Chris.

They were sitting very close, Leila practically in Chris's lap, carefully feeding him oatmeal, looking all lovey-dovey.

Chris was also playing along, silently eating.

"Can't you see we are busy here, Amelia? Why don't you wait outside for a bit?" Leila's face had a smile, but her voice was cold and full of provocation.

It was like she was saying, 'Amelia, see, Chris and I are the perfect match,he loves me the most.'


Amelia hadn't expected this.

Her heart ached, like a dull knife cutting flesh.
She had clearly decided to let go of Chris, to leave him.

But she still felt hurt seeing this scene.

"Then I won't disturb you, carry on." She took a deep breath,barely suppressing the pain in her heart, placed the folder on the table, and silently retreated.


"Stop!" Chris suddenly spoke, "Did I allow you to leave?"


He had an aura of authority, even a simple sentence was enough to make people tremble.

Leila was puzzled, "Chris, she..."

"Who gave you this?" Chris's cold gaze swept over the folder on the table.

Amelia then understood why he suddenly acted up.

"It was Mr. Howard, he asked me to give it to you," she explained calmly,holding back the urge to curse.

Leila, however, said sarcastically, "Oh? Mr. Howard wants to discuss business with Chris, but didn't give it to him personally, instead, he gave it to you. Are you two very close, or is there something special between you?"

"It's none of your business." Amelia retorted.

"Chris, look at her, clearly guilty, yet questioning others. Doesn't she know any decency? She hasn't even divorced you yet, and she's already so wanton." Leila snuggled up to Chris, lightly, not daring to lean too close.

"Yes, some people are just like that." Chris snorted coldly,"So how should we punish her?"
Leila was stunned.

"Kick her out, Chris, out of sight, out of mind, let her get far away, so we don't have to..."

"Did you hear that?" Chris glared at Amelia, "Get out."

Amelia's heartache reachedI its peak.

Her head was aching and dizzy, her vision blurred.

She didn't delay for a second, turned and left.

She almost fell due to her fast pace, luckily she held onto the wall.

It was okay, her wounds could heal on their own.

She stayed in a secluded place for a long time, until her vision cleared,then slowly walked out, but hadn't taken a few steps before Ryder stopped her.


"Mrs. Spencer." Ryder stood at the corner of the hallway, his eyes calm.quietly watching her, "You can't leave."

"Chris has told me to leave," she was puzzled.

"Please come with me." Ryder made a"please" gesture.

Amelia shook her head, "I'm not going," she vaguely sensed how she would be treated next.

"This is Mr. Spencer's order, please don't make it dificult for me." Ryder was a bit helpless.

Meanwhile,in the ward.
Leila continued to pick up the bowl, "Chris, you barely ate, have some more.otherwise later..."

"You can leave now." Chris suddenly spoke.

Before Leila could react, someone came in to escort her out.

"Chris, what are you doing? I need to stay and take care of you."

"No need." Chris's voice was as cold as ever, showing no emotion.
###Chapter 36

"Chris, what do you mean?" She quickly set down the bowl and grabbed his arm gently. "I can't just leave you here alone."


"None of your business," Chris muttered, closing his eyes, clearly done with the conversation.


Leila knew it was time to go.

She barely managed to stand, wobbling on her high heels as they caught on the thick carpet.


"Chris, why?" Her voice trembled, tears brimming. "Why are you treating me like this? Was I just a pawn to you? Are you still hung up on Amelia?She doesn't care about you anymore. She's moved on, flirting with other guys."

"I said, get out," Chris snapped, his patience wearing thin.

The tension in the room was palpable.

Leila ran out, tears streaming down her face.

Amelia wasn't having a great time either. Ryder had dragged her back to her old home.

"Mrs. Spencer, you need to stay here until Mr. Spencer returns," Ryder said firmly. "Otherwise, we can't ensure your father's safety. His health is unstable and he needs care."

Amelia shot back, "You're using my dad to blackmail me?"

How absurd.
"I have no other choice," Ryder sighed. "Please, don't make this harder for me."


He even bowed to her.

Amelia stood there, feeling like her blood had turned to ice.

But what could she do? Her father was still under their control.

Fine. She'd take it one step at a time.

There wasn't much in this house that felt like hers anymore, buIt remnants of her past lingered.

The beige carpet in the living room, the pink dishes in the kitchen, the green plants on the balcony, and the designer bags in the three-story walk-in closet that she never used.


She never thought she'd be back here.

Life was full of surprises.

"Mrs. Spencer, the bath is ready. Would you like to take one now?" The maid asked with a smile. "Dinner is also prepared."

Amelia was taken aback. Since when were they so nice to her?

She used to be invisible in this house.

But she did need a good soak.

As soon as she sank into the bathtub, Amelia felt like she had been standing forever and finally found a placeto sit.

The warm water enveloped her tired body, relaxing her limbs,and slowly
lowering her guard as she slipped deeper into the water without realizing it.

She was so exhausted, she just wanted to stay like this.

She even closed her eyes, letting her arms drape over the edge of the tub.

She didn't notice when the door creaked open.

"Asleep?" Chris stood at the bathroom door, looking at her peaceful face with a hint of mockery.


Damn Amelia, she was so careless she could drown herself.

Chris walked in slowly.

Watching her slide further into the water, with her neck and chin submerged, he felt a twisted sense of amusement.

It would be interesting to see her choke on water.

She deserved it for her mistakes.

In just a few seconds, Amelia really slipped under.

But in that moment, Chris reached out and pulled her up.

Amelia was nearly scared to death. When she saw who it was, she was even more shocked. "Chris, what are you doing here? Let go of me."

She shoved him away, then quickly crouched back into the bathtub,covering her chest with her hands,her face turning bright red.

Chris's clothes were soaked, and after being pushed, he staggered back a few steps, his leg wound reopening painfully.
"Damn it. Amelia!" He gritted his teeth, glaring at her. "Ungratefu fool!"

"I didn't mean to. You barged in suddenly, and..."

She stopped mid-sentence, noticing his pale, pained expression.

She swallowed the rest of her words, but the concern stuck in her throat,unable to come out.


When she saw the blood seeping from his leg wound again, she hurriedly said, "You're bleeding again. Go out and let Ryder bandage you."

Chris sneered, "What does my bleeding have to do with you? Haven't you already hooked up with Lucius? Why care about me?"

Amelia rolled her eyes.

"Turn around so I can put on my robe." Her legs were going numb from crouching.


Chris looked impatient. "I've seen you in every possible way,stop pretending to be shy."

With that, he suddenly stood up, bracing himself against the wall, and staggered towards her.

His tall, slender figurecast a suffocating shadow like a demon.

Amelia's face turned pale, and she kept holding her ground without retreating. "Chris, you're bleeding. Go out."

Before she could finish, he grabbed her shoulder, his hand like a vice,almost crushing her bones.

Amelia winced in pain, her face turning pale, but she gritted her teeth,
refusing to beg for mercy. "Release me, you..."

He suddenly lifted her horizontally, turned to the bedroom, and threw her onto the bed, then pressed her down.

Their eyes met, and Amelia could see the flames of anger and her own pale face in his eyes.

"What are you doing? Are you crazy?" She instinctively looked at his leg. "You're still injured."

Chris's eyes flashed with irritation, and he kissed her lips.

Finally, the world was quiet.

Amelia's eyes widened, her mind in chaos.

He was kissing her? Had he suffered from a mental disability?

Gradually, he tried to pry open her lips, going deeper, while his hands roamed her wet, naked body, easily finding her breasts.

Amelia's mind went blank, and in her struggle,she slapped him.

Chris stopped abruptly, his ears ringing.

"Amelia!" His voice was filled with murderous intent.

Amelia was almost paralyzed with fear, her legs trembling as she crawled away.

"Stop!" His face turned red with anger, but his wound reopened, causing him intense pain.

Amelia quickly hid in the guest room, locking the door and pushing a half-
height cabinet and a leather sofa against it.

At this moment, this was the only way she could avoid him. He was too terrifying, like he wanted to devour her.

There were plenty of people outside to take care of him.

As she expected, after Chris threw a fit, he gradually calmed down.

Ryder gently persuaded him to treat his wound to avoid any lasting effects.

"Mr. Spencer, you need to rest and avoid strenuous activity and stress," the doctor advised earnestly.


Chris just gave a cold smile and spat out a violent sentence, "Amelia,just wait!"
###Chapter 37

To keep herself safe, Amelia spent a night shaking with fear before calling Victor,offering to cook him a meal.


Victor was thrilled. He showed up early in the morning,even before Chris was awake.

"Grandpa, have some fruit first. The salmon you like will be ready soon,"Amelia said, her smile as bright as a blooming flower. She handed Victor some fruit and snacks before rushing into the kitchen.


"Amelia!" Chris's angry voice suddenly boomed from the second-floor bedroom.


Even in the kitchen, Amelia could hear the fury in his tone.

She pretended not to hear it.

The next moment, Victor's authoritative voice rang out, "What are you yelling for? Get up quickly!"

Amelia felt a bit relieved. Thank goodness.

"Chris, whay aren't you in the hospital? What are you doing back here?"Victor asked, clearly annoyed, as he sat at the dining table.

Chris's face was cold, his eyes fixed on Amelia like she was prey.

Amelia ignored him, focusing on serving dishes to Victor. "Grandpa, it's a bit hot, be careful. Also, try these broccoli and green beans. The vegetables are good for your health."

Victor smiled warmly at her but turned serious when he looked at Chris."
Answer me, are you mute? In your condition, coming back here is just asking for trouble."

"The hospital is boring," Chris muttered, his expression almost twisted."Grandpa, what brings you here?"

He shot a sharp glance at Amelia, who was quietly eating.

"What, I'm not welcome?" Victor snorted.

"Grandpa, after breakfast, how about we go for a walk? I haven't been out in a while," Amelia suggested sweetly, her eyes sparkling.

Victor was glad to go, but his next words left Amelia stunned.

"Chris, since you don't want to stay in the hospital, you should come with us. Whatever Amelia likes, you buy it for her," he decided with a wave of his hand.


Amelia was speechless.No!

"Sure," Chris finally smiled, but it was a dangerous smile, like a snake ready to strike.

"Grandpa, his body hasn't fully recovered. Going out might not be a good idea," Amelia cautiously advised.


"No problem,I can walk just fine," Chris said, raising an eyebrow, a clear challenge in his eyes.

"Don't worry, he's strong. And we can bring a doctor along." Victor laughed heartily.

Amelía's face turned pale, but she couldn't argue with Victor and was forced to go shopping with the two of them.
It was really uncomfortable.

Soon, they arrived at the nearest mall, which had been cleared out,leaving only smiling salespeople giving them strange looks.


Amelia even thought it would be better if Leila were here; at least she could divert some attention.


"Amelia, do you want to buy some clothes? This store looks nice," Victor pointed to a nearby women's clothing store and asked.


Amelia wanted to say no, but then she remembered she'd been to this store before, and it had a row of big fitting rooms.

"Sure, let's check it out," she said, trying to sound enthusiastic.

She used the excuse of trying on clothes to hide in one of the fitting rooms.


The moment she sat down, she finally felt a bit of relief, even if it was just for a few seconds.


Should she make a run for it, or fake being sick and leave right away?


Chris was definitely planning something today.

"Amelía, are you done changing?" Victor's voice suddenly called out.


Amelia jumped, quickly got up, and hurriedly put on the fiery red dress.

But she couldn't zip up the back.

"Excuse me, miss, could you come in and help me with the zipper?" she asked the salesperson outside the curtain.

Before long, someone came in.
Amelia heard the sound and said, "Please help me, I can't reach the top."

Then, a large hand held her waist, and another hand slowly pulled the zipper up.

But the touch felt oddly intimate.

Amelia suddenly felt a chill run down her spine.

That instinctive sense of danger kicked in.

She turned around instinctively.

Sure enough, she met Chris's intense gaze.


Chris was looking down at her, leisurely, with a mocking smile, like a predator eyeing its prey.

The cramped fitting room felt even smaller with the two of them in it.leaving her no room to escape.


"Why are you here? This is the women's fitting room," Amelia's voice trembled, and the color drained from her face.


Chris raised an eyebrow and said indifferently, "So what?"

His demeanor was like that of a king.

Without another word, Amelia tried to slip past him.

But he easily grabbed her and pinned her against the wall.

"Trying to run?" His figure loomed over her like a giantmonster."Amelia,I thought you had some guts."

He gradually closed in, trapping her in his arms, forming a narrow
enclosure. No matter how she struggled, she couldn't escape.

"What are you doing? Grandpa is still outside, and there are other people.Do you want them to see this?" Amelia's eyes were frantic, like a helpless fawn.

"He's already gone," Chris grinned maliciously. "I sent him away."

Amelia was freaked out.

It was over.

"How should I deal with you for what happened last night?" Chris's voice was low and magnetic, exuding extreme danger. "Now, you have nowhere to run."


"It has nothing to do with me," Amelia gritted her teeth, each word difficult to utter. "It was you who..."

Before she could finish, he grabbed her by the throat.

Fortunately, he didn't use much force, and the gesture was more of a threat than an actual attempt to harm her.

"Then kill me, and we'll be even," she grabbed his hand with both of hers,trying desperately to pry it off, but it was futile.

He watched her struggle with interest, finding it amusing. Amelia had transformed from a timid mouse into a bold eagle over time.

He wanted to see what else she could become.

"Chris, do you have feelings for me?" She had a sudden idea and put on a delighted expression,
Her voice and demeanor were just like the old her.

Chris squinted his eyes, a flash of disgust passing through them.

He immediately let go of her throat.

Amelia, feeling as if she had been granted a reprieve, didn't think twice and pushed him away to run.
###Chapter 38
His arms suddenly felt empty. Before he could react, Amelia had already turned and bolted toward the exit.
Chris’s temper flared instantly. "Don't let her leave!" he commanded, his voice cold and echoing through the hall.
Amelia barely made it to the courtyard before two security guards moved to block her path. They didn't strike her, but their presence was an immovable wall. When she tried to push past, they firmly guided her back toward the living room.
Chris was waiting, leaning back on the sofa with a gaze that made Amelia feel like a chess piece being moved against her will. At that moment, a rage she had suppressed for years finally erupted.
"Let go of me!" she cried, her voice raw. Her eyes were wide, filled with the desperate energy of someone who had reached their breaking point.
The room fell silent. Even Chris seemed taken aback by the sheer intensity of her defiance. He signaled for the guards to step back.
"You shouldn't have run, Amelia," he said, his tone low. "It only complicates things."
Amelia let out a sharp, mocking laugh. "Complicates things? For whom? What right do you have to dictate where I go or who I see?"
The feeling of being trapped was suffocating. Chris’s jaw tightened, and for a moment, he seemed unable to find an answer that sounded reasonable.
"Because I say so," he finally replied, a dark smile playing on his lips. "Now, come back inside."
"No!" Amelia gritted her teeth. "Chris, I don't love you anymore. Do you understand? I want the divorce finalized. I want to live a life where I don't have to look over my shoulder to see if you're watching."
For a split second, a complex, unreadable emotion flickered in Chris’s eyes. Amelia was gambling—betting that even if he didn't love her, his pride wouldn't allow him to keep a woman who openly despised him.
"Say that again," he whispered.
"I said, I don't love you. I want a future without you. Are you really so desperate that you’d force someone who feels nothing for you to stay?"
"Then who is it?" Chris stood up abruptly, his composure finally cracking. "If not me, then who? Is there someone else?"
Amelia saw the white of his knuckles as he clenched his fists. With a vengeful smile, she threw out the first name she knew would provoke him. "What if there is? What if it's someone like Lucius Howard? At least he treats people with respect."
The mention of Lucius was like a match to a powder keg. Chris moved faster than she could react, catching her arm and pulling her toward him. The intensity in his gaze was terrifying.
"Lucius?" he hissed. "You think he’s your escape? Fine. Let’s go ask him."
Amelia felt a surge of dread. "What are you doing? Chris, stop!"
He didn't listen. He led her out to the car, his movements driven by a reckless, unbridled energy. He got behind the wheel and floored the gas, the engine roaring as they sped toward the city center.
"Chris, I was just trying to get a reaction! Stop the car!" she pleaded as the needle on the speedometer climbed. "You aren't even fully recovered yet! I was wrong to say it, okay? I don't feel that way about him!"
The car suddenly screeched to a halt by the roadside. Amelia lurched forward, but Chris’s arm shot out to steady her. He looked at her, his eyes icy and filled with a pain he refused to acknowledge.
"Get out," he said, his voice a jagged rasp.
Amelia was stunned, but she didn't hesitate. She opened the door and ran, disappearing into the shadows of the evening.
Chris stayed in the car, watching her go. His chest felt tight, a weight pressing down on him that he couldn't explain. He told himself it was just possessiveness—that he simply didn't like losing what was his. But deep down, the silence of the car felt heavier than it ever had before.
That night, Amelia walked through a quiet park with her friend Sophia.
"He’s completely lost his mind," Sophia said, shaking her head after hearing the story. "Does he even know what he wants from you? It’s like he’s obsessed with the idea of you, but doesn't know how to actually be with you."
Amelia looked at the distant city lights. "That’s why I need to leave. He doesn't want me; he just wants to win."
Before she could continue, Sophia’s phone rang. It was Nolan, one of Chris’s associates.
"Is Amelia with you? Chris is at the club," Nolan’s voice sounded frantic. "He’s been drinking despite his medication. He’s in a bad way, and he won't let the medics near him. He keeps calling for her."
Amelia grabbed the phone. "Nolan, he has dozens of people to look after him. Why are you calling me?"
"Because he’s going to end up in the ER if he doesn't stop," Nolan replied. "Please, just come and talk him down."
Amelia hesitated. She remembered the many times Chris had used his health to manipulate her. But the thought of him actually being in danger made her heart ache in a way she couldn't ignore.
"I'll just see if he's okay and come straight back," she told Sophia, ignoring her friend’s warned expression.
The club was an elegant, high-end establishment. Nolan met her at the entrance, his face pale with worry. "He’s in the private suite. He’s been out of control since you left. Go in there, please. You’re the only one he might actually listen to."
Amelia took a deep breath and pushed open the heavy mahogany doors, unaware that she was walking back into the very cage she had just tried to escape.

###Chapter 39

The second the door to the private room swung open, the vibe turned icy.

Amelia's eyes locked onto Chris in the corner.

And the delicate figure next to him.


"What the heck is going on?" Nolan's face was a mix of shock and confusion.


He quickly turned to Amelia, "Sorry, I have no idea what's happening.Just a moment ago..."

"Mr. Powell, why bother explaining to her? Do we need her permnission for anything?" Leila's voice cut through the tension.

She was draped all over Chris, her hands snaking around his neck, almost kissing hís cheek.


But Chris just sat there, letting her cling to him, not even glancing at Amelia standing at the door.

"Got it." Amelia's smile was faint, a flicker of realization in her eyes.

She'd embarrassed herself again.

Sophia was right; she was a fool for walking into this.

Being deceived over and over hadn't made her see the truth.

They were all laughing at her.

"Leila, what are you doing?" Nolan's face twisted in disgust.
"Mr. Powell, what do you think I'm doing? I'm helping Chris. Can't you see he's feeling awful?" Leila's smile was sweet, her face annoyingly charming.

Amelia turned and walked out.

She couldn't stay another second.

As soon as she left, Chris's eyes followed her.

Her back was so strong.

How had he never noticed this proud side of her before?

"Chris, want some water?" Leila's grip around his neck tightened, her voice sugary sweet.

Chris's body tensed, but he didn't push her away.

"I had someone make ginger tea; it'll be here soon." Leila kept smiling, but her eyes dimmed because Chris wasn't looking at her at all.

"Get out." Chris's voice was suddenly cold.

Leila blinked, "What?"

"Get out," Chris roared, "All of you, leave."

Leila's face went pale, and she didn't dare say another word.

Everyone else quickly left too, except for Nolan, who looked at Chris helplessly, "Look at you, causing all this drama. You should've stuck with the pity act; it was working. She came, didn't she? Now you're trying reverse psychology, but Amelia's not someone you can mess with like that."
"She's gone, so shut up!" Chris snapped, "Come over and drink!"

Nolan sighed, "Alright, alright, I give up. Having a friend like you..."

They drank glass after glass,getting completely hammered.


When they were both out cold, a figure appeared, helping to carry Chris to the presidential suite upstairs.

Then, she drew the curtains, undressed, and slipped into bed beside him.

This was how it should be.

Finally, she had her chance!


The next morning, sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting a glow on Chris's handsome, chiseled face.

His head was killing him.

Chris rubbed his temples, trying to piece together the hazy memories of last night.

As he sat up, he noticed someone next to him.

Leila? His face immediately darkened.

Leila woke up at that moment too.

Their eyes met, and a flash of shock crossed her face.

"Chris, this..." She quickly pulled the blanket over herself, her voice trembling with anxiety, "I don't know what happened last night, I also..."

"Cut the act." Chris wasn't having any of it,"Get out."
Leila's face tightened, a hint of defiance showing,but she got up, turned her back to him, and quietly got dressed.

"Chris, we both passed out drunk last night. I don't blame you, and I won't tell anyone about this. Don't worry." Leila wiped away a tear, grabbed her bag, and headed for the door.


"Wait." Chris's voice halted her.

Leila's heart skipped a beat.

She knew this would work. Spending the night together, waking up in the same bed, he would have to acknowledge something happened.

And maybe, just maybe, she could win his heart!

"Leila, do you think I'm an idiot?" Chris's words were like stones thrown into a calm lake, causing ripples.

Leila's face went pale.


She felt like she couldn't breathe, as if someone was choking her, her life hanging by a thread.


"What do you mean? Are you suspecting me of deceiving you? Do you think I'm that kind of woman? How can you treat me like this?" she asked,her voice shaking.


"I'm not suspecting you," Chris sneered, "I'mn certain."

He looked at her with disdain, "This trick is old. I can't believe you'd even try it."

Leila bit herlip hard, feeling humiliated, like she was standing naked and no one even wanted to look at her.
Other women were just ordinary; how could they compare to her?

She was the one who truly loved him.

It was all Amelia's fault, that bitch.

"This is the last time I'll be lenient with you," Chris said coldly, leaving no room for argument.

Leila stood there, frozen, for a full ten minutes before she finally caught her breath.


Then she left, opened her phone, and sent all the photos she had taken last night to Amelia.

Bitch, the pain I endure, you will suffer a hundred times more!

Soon,Amelia received the photos.

Leila, being a big star, knèw how to choose the best angles. Every photo she took was sexy,glamorous, and extremely suggestive.


Amelia's hand holding the phone trembled slightly, and her heart seemed to shatter along with the photos.

After leaving the club last night, she caught a cold, her head pounding,and a low fever setting in. She knew she was pregnant and couldn't take medicine casually, so she went to Lucius's hospital for a check-up and a prenatal examination.
###Chapter 40

She never thought she'd get such a shock while waiting for the doctor.

Amelia quietly deleted the photos, but each one felt like it was burned into her memory.

Out of nowhere, a sharp pain hit her stomach.

She couldn't take it and slid off the sofa.

"What's wrong with her?" Lucius asked, standing by the hospital bed.


"She became extremely upset and almost had a miscarriage. Luckily, I gave her some meds in time to save the baby," the doctor said seriously.


"Upset?" Lucius repeated, "Was it Chris again?"

His black-clad assistant stepped up, whispered something in his ear.

"Leila?" Lucius sneered, "I'm not surprised."

"She came out of Chris's room today, looking all down, like she failed."

"But she still managed to upset this little kitten." Lucius glanced at Amelia's pale face, "Go warn Leila to back off."

The assistant quietly left.

In the big,sterile-smelling room, it was just the two of them.

Lucius sat by Amelia for a long time, staring at her delicate face,his mind racing.

He couldn't help but thinkhow different Amelia was from Bella.
They had no connection, nothing in common.

But sometimes, he saw a flicker of familiarity in Amelia's eyes.

Lucius looked away and took a deep breath.

He was a strategist.

He couldn't let a pawn mess with his head.

Even if he did feel a bit guilty and sorry for this pawn.

"Mr. Howard?" When Amelia woke up, she saw Lucius's familiar face and thought she was dreaming.


"You're awake?" Lucius hid his emotions, stood up calmly, and touched her forehead, "The fever's gone, feeling better?"

Amelia nodded gratefully, "Much better, thank you, Mr. Howard."

Lucius sighed, "You should thank yourself. Luckily, you're in good health,which saved the baby."


"What?" Amnelia's face went pale, and she instinctively covered her belly,"What happened to my baby?"


"It was a close call," Lucius said seriously, "You're not alone now, you need to be more careful."


Amelia's tears started falling.

Hadn't she been careful enough? Why did people keep messing with her?

"What's your plan?" Lucius asked.

"I don't know." Her mind was a mess, "I need to settle down my dad first.
Chris has him under control, I can't just leave him."

"He's already out." Lucius smiled gently, "He was discharged yesterday morning and is back with your mom and sister."

Amelia looked shocked, "Is that true? I haven't heard from him."


"Stop hesitating. I'll give you a day to think about it." Lucius said and then got up to leave.

Should she leave?

Amelia's mind was spinning.

Those two had already slept together, what was she holding on to?

She then made up her mind.

Lucius was efficient and already arranged the nearest flight to Zephyria for her,three days later.

Amelia wanted to see her dad one last time.

She set up a meeting with Paxton at a restaurant.

"Dad, have some more. You've lost so much weight from being in the hospital." Amelia kept piling food onto Paxton's plate, which was already overflowing.


Paxton looked at her with concern, "You're the one who's lost weight.Look at your face, it's so thin. Have you been through tough things recently?"


Amelia's face tightened for a moment but then softened, "Dad, I'm doing fine. I got a new job, and my boss and coworkers are great. I'm much
happier now. But I have to go out of town in a few days."

"Where to? Why?" Paxton asked, worried.

Amelia held his hand, "My boss wants me to go on a business trip for a week. Don't worry. But I'm only telling you this, don't tell anyone else,especially not Mom, okay?"


Paxton knew his wife didn't like Amelia and sighed deeply, "You have your own life, I get it. I won't cause you any trouble."


As they parted, Amelia watched Paxton walk away,feeling a mix of emotions.


She took a cab to go back.

On the way, her mind was filled with thoughts of Paxton's graying hair,and she felt a deep sadness. Tears welled up in her eyes.


But there was a silver lining; she was finally going to leave everything behind.


"Hey, what's going on? That car's been following us and trying to cut us off!" The driver suddenly spoke up, annoyed.

Amelia snapped back to reality,"What's wrong,一Sir?"

She turned to look out the window.

She saw a car behind them trying to sideswipe their car, moving quickly,clearly up to no good.

Amelia felt a sense of dread.

"Sir, let's avoid it," shesaid.
The driver, however, was agitated, "No one on this street can cut me off.Hold on, I'll get us away from that car!"

"Don't, please drive steadily..." She hadn't finished her sentence when a strong pushback sensation hit her. She hurriedly grabbed the seatbelt, "Don't do this, slow down, Sir, I'm scared!"


The driver was confident, "What are you afraid of? I'm the best driver in our circle,just relax!"


Before he finished speaking, the car was hit from behind, sliding forward fifteen feet. The most dangerous part was that they were already on a bridge over the river.

There was a rushing river below!

"Damn it, how dare they hit my car? Do they have a death wish?" The driver was furious, reversing ten feet, trying to retaliate.


But at that moment, a car in front suddenly crashed into them.

The driver had no time to react, a strong force hit them.


The next second, they were airborne, and a strong sense of weightlessness surrounded them.


As the car hit the water, Amelia felt the breath of death.

How could this happen?


She instinctively protected her belly, but the feeling of despair was overwhelming.

She had just decided to start a new life.
Why?

"Miss, are you okay? Grab my hand!" The driver had already escaped through the window, trying to pull Amelia out.
###Chapter 41

Amelia's world was pitch black; she felt nothing but fear, cold, and endless tension.


Who was it, and why was she always the one getting hurt?

With these questions swirling in her mind. Amelia drifted into a shivering nightmare.

Meanwhile, Chris was at the hospital, changing his bandages.


For some reason, he was super irritable today, his heart filled with a vague unease, like something bad had happened.

"Mr. Spencer, you can't keep letting the wound split open like this, or it'll cause serious complications," the doctor warned.

Chris gave him a casual glance but didn't respond.

Ryder suddenly burst in, "Mr. Spencer, something's happened."

Chris shot up, "Spill it!"

Ryder's forehead was covered in cold sweat, his face pale, "Mrs. Spencer,she..."


"What happened?" Chris's face changed dramatically as he grabbed Ryder by the collar, "Speak quickly."

"She had a car accident and fell into the river," Ryder's voice trembled slightly.

In the past, this news might not have meant much to Chris; he didn't care if something happened to Amelia.
But recently, Ryder had noticed a change in Chris's attitude towards her.

"Damn it!" Chris staggered back a step, gritting his teeth, "Why are you still standing there? Go save her!"

He rushed out the door.


Ryder wanted to say he had already sent people, but before he could speak,Chris was gone.


At Pinnacle Culture Media Ltd1., in the conference room.


"Mr.Howard," Sable quickly stepped forward and whispered a few words in Lucius's ear.


Lucius's face changed slightly, "Are you sure?"

"Absolutely sure, Amelia fell in, and she hasn't been rescued yet," Sable's voice was panicked, worried that Lucius would get angry.

A month ago, Lucius had ordered her to keep an eye on Amelia and ensure her safety.

Lucius was silent for several seconds.

In the large conference room, all the senior leaders were watching him.


"Mr. Howard, is something wrong?" A director sitting next to him asked solemnly.


Lucius waved his hand lightly and said to Sable, "Go rescue her, and make sure everything is foolproof."

She nodded quickly.
Lucius added, "No, contact Shawn, let him go, you assist him, don't let Chris's people finad you, and don't let anyone know Amelia's whereabouts."

Until the evening, those people were still busy.


Many passersby were confused,seeing a tall young man in the crowd,anxiously looking around, repeatedly trying to go into the water to rescue someone, only to be pulled back forcefully.


"Mr. Spencer, there are already enough people down there, please, don't risk your life, you're not in good condition..."


"Shut up!" Chris snapped impatiently, "Don't come back until you find Amelia!"


"Chris, what are you doing? Your wound has split open again, are you out of your mind?" Leila rushed over, grabbing his arm, desperately trying to get him back to the car, at least out of the wind, his face was completely pale.


Chris pushed her away harshly, "Get lost!"

Leila cried, her figure weak and fraġile.


Amelia, wrapped in a thick blanket, quietly watched the scene from a car by the roadside.


She didn't know whether to thank fate or hate it.


When she sank to the bottom of the river, she blacked out for a bit but quickly came to.

Maybe it wwas because, at that moment, she thought of the baby in her belly and the decision she had finally made to start a fresh new life.
A strong will to survive and a sense of determination made her wake up,holding her breath with all her might,slowly floating up from the bottom.

She found herself carried a long way downstream, far from where she had fallen in.

As dusk fell, visibility on the river was low. WithouIt alerting anyone,she quietly floated a thousand feet downstream and then climbed ashore in a spot without cameras.

Her phone had sunk with the car, and she couldn't contact anyone related to Chris.


She thought of Shawn, through whom she could find Lucius.

She borrowed a phone from a passerby and dialed Shawn's number.

"Stop looking, you're about to freeze to death. Let's get you to the hospital now." Shawn rolled up the car window, looking at Amelia's pale face in the passenger seat, feeling sorry for her, and raised the temperature in the car by a couple of degrees.

Amelia, shivering, wrapped herself tightly and forced a smile, "Thank you,Shawn."


She felt an urge to cry. In less than a month, she had faced death twice.

Fortunately, this time, she didn't rely on anyone's help.

It turned out she could be this strong.

"If you want to thank me, please follow me." Shawn raised an eyebrow and smiled,"Sit tight."

Soon, she was taken to an ordinary mid-range apartment complex in the
suburbs.

Shawn had found a doctor to check her condition.

"Please, save my baby." Toavoid revealing her identity, Amelia wore a mask and sunglasses. As soon as she spoke, Shawn was stunned.


"When did you get pregnant? It surprised me!" His eyes were particularly complex, a flash of sadness passing through them.

Amelia had no time to explain, only repeating, "I must save the baby."

The doctor examined her, frowning, "Your body is cold, muscles stiff, there's a high risk of miscarriage, you must take medication immediately to protect the pregnancy."

"Please." Amelia's eyes welled up with tears.

This was her only child left. If she lost him too, what would be the point of living?


"I just heard you fell into the water not before long. You seem to be cursed with bad luck. Maybe you should go to a church and pray to God to get rid of the bad luck?" Shawn muttered.


Amelia was too weak to speak.

It seemed all her suffering began when she married Chris.


His family, the women around him, always brought her various pressures and negative impacts, and this time was definitely not an accident.

She was exhausted.

The doctor soon brought the medication, and Amelia took it without
hesitation.

At this moment, Shawn came back with two large bags.

"Rest here for now. These are all the supplies I bouight for you,enough for half a month." Shawn advised, "I have to go. If I stay here, Chris might trace me and find you."

He was very considerate.


"By the way, take this phone. I was surprised that you remembered my number. I've entered my number in it just in case. If anything happens,contact me, got it?" Shawn's tone was like they were at a spy meeting.

Amelia silently took the phone, looking at him seriously, "Thank you."
###Chapter 42

Shawn was slightly stunned.

Seeing her clear but distant eyes, he suddenly remembered how she always aimed to be the best at everything back in school.

She was so tough and full of life.

And she had this totally free spirit.

That's why he couldn't forget her all these years.

"It's nothing," Shawn shrugged with a casual smile. "After being overshadowed by you for so long, I had to grab this chance to help you,especially to stick it to that annoying guy Chris."

Hearing this, Amelia frowned.

She remembered what she saw not long ago.

He was all cozy with Leila, so why was he acting like he cared so much about her now?


Was he just trying to look like a devoted lóver for his own gain?

Amelia's heart ached, like someone was cutting it with a dull knife.

"Will it get you in trouble?" She forced a smile, trying to seem relaxed.

Shawn waved it off, "Nah, I'm like a ghost. I'll go over there and pretend to search you, then no one will suspect me. Just focus on getting better and don't worry about anything else."

Amelia nodded firmly.
There was Lucius, and then there was Shawn.

She would definitely remember the two of them, and if they ever needed her help, she'd give it her all.

The folks by the river had been at it for a whole day and night, and they'd almost caught all the fish in the river.

Chris still wasn't giving up.

"Chris, what are you trying to do? It's been over a day. Even if you find her,it won't matter!" Victor's voice was hoarse and pained.

"Yeah, Chris, your leg is bleeding. Are you trying to kill yourself? Come back with us!"


The other Spencer family members were there too, but no one could stop the crazed Chris.


He was terrifying, waiting there for so long without a word, like a trapped beast that wouldn't stop until it got what it wanted.

"Please, Chris, you've been up for a day and a night without rest or food.
You might collapse." Leila cried, her voice especially hoarse.

Hearing this, Chris suddenly looked at her, grabbed her collar fiercely, and asked through gritted teeth, "Was it you?"

He was completely panicked.

"No,how could it be me? I was filming on set yesterday. How could I have time to hurt her?" Leila's face went pale with fear, backing away but unable to move.

"It better not be you." Chris's voice was as cold as Arctc ice,sending chills
down everyone's spine.

After saying that, he casually tossed Leila aside and shouted, "Keep searching!"

"Now you regret it? What were you doing earlier?" Shawn taunted,"Amelia's gone, and now you're putting on a show. Anyone who doesn't know might think you're devoted to her. Look at our Mr. Spencer,so considerate and good,right?"


"Shawn, you're asking for trouble!" Chris turned around, locking eyes with Shawn.


Their eyes locked, and Shawn could see the contempt in Chris's eyes.

"You took her away, Shawn. You must have a death wish," Chris growled,sounding like a mnadman.

Shawn just sneered, "Mr. Spencer, looks like you've really lost it. If I took her,why am I here?" He was fuming too. "If I knew this would happen,I would've made her divorce you, you idiot. This is all your fault!"

Chris didn't respond with words. He threw a punch.

Shawn didn't back down, and they quickly started brawling.

"Stop!" Victor was so mad his blood pressure nearly spiked. He turned to the people around him, "Why are you standing idle? Break it up!"

The two were quickly pulled apart.

By then, Shawn was already beaten black and blue. He was no match for Chris.


But Chris wasn't doing much better. His body had deteriorated over the
days, and blood was seeping from his wounds, staining his clothes red.

"What's the point of denying it? The facts are right here. You can't even take care of your wife, always putting her in danger. She's quite unlucky to have met you..."

"Say that again!" Chris's body radiated a terrifying killing intent.

"I'll say it a hundred times if I have to. Anyone who gets close to you is unlucky. You're a jinx!" Shawn seemed to have a death wish, continuously provoking him.

"Shut up!" A gentle yet angry male voice cut through the tension,"Get out immediately."

It was Lucius.

"Lucius, please talk some sense into Chris. He's gone mad!" Victor seemed to see hope and hurriedly stepped forward to hold Lucius's hand.


"Dad, don't worry. I brought some good swimmers. They'll help." Lu1cius held Victor's wrist, his voice steady.

"Lucius, I know you are aware of her situation." Chris suddenly turned around, his sharp gaze fixed on Lucius.


A flash of anger crossed Lucius's eyes, "It has nothing to do with me.I'm here to help you."

He signaled to his assistant, "Get the doctor to treat him."

"Get lost, all of you!" Chris growled at Lucius's people, "Lucius, don't let me catch you."

"Take him away." Lucius waved his hand, and the bodyguards he brought
swarmed forward, pinning Chris to the ground, making him unable to move.


His wound split open again, and his body was extremely fragile.

If it weren't for Lucius, no one would dare to touch him.

"Lucius, if I find out you caused the accidJent..."


"Chris, stop talking nonsense. We've already investigated. It was an accident. The driver confessed, admitting it was his mishandling that caused it. How can you blame others?" Victor's voice was filled with sorrow and anger.

Chris was forcibly lifted onto a stretcher and taken to the ambulance.

"Dad, he just can't accept the truth. Let's go back." Lucius sighed,somewhat helplessly.


Victor silently gazed at the shimmering river reflecting the lights, a sigh escaping his lips.

That night, Amelia saw the news about her accident.

She also learned more about Chris's strange behavior after her accident.
###Chapter 43

But why?

He didn't love her at all, that was clear as day, yet he acted like he was head over heels. Didn't that wear him out?


She'd been holed up in this plain little apartment for over two weeks now.The doctor said she was stable during the last check-up, buIt her body had taken a serious hit and needed extra TLC. No more drama, he warned.


She decided to leave but not now. . She needed a solid plan first.

One day, Lucius dropped by.

"Chris has been stuck in the hospital for half a month. My dad's been staying with him, giving you some breathing room." Lucius was as cool as ever.


,He was always so unflappable, like a calm stream.

Chris, in contrast, was a mix of fire and ice.Amelia brought over two cups of coffee. "Thanks a ton, both of you. If it weren't for you, I don't know what would've happened to me."

She appeared healthier, not as worn out as before.

"No biggie, just a small effort. It wvas mostly your strength and luck that fooled Chris." Shawn crossed his arms, a clear smile in his eyes.


He was a straightforward guy,always smiling at her.


"Are you really sure about this?" Lucius changed the topic. "Once you decide to leave, there's no going back."
Amelia's face darkened, and she pressed her lips together. "Yes, I'm sure."

As soon as she said it, memories with Chris flashed through her mind like a movie.


If her time with Chris was split into ten parts, nine were filled with tears,with just a tiny bit of sweetness at the end.

In the past, even the tiny bit of love was enough to keep her devoted to him.


But now, she had something even more precious to protect.

"I've decided." She looked up at Lucius. "Mr. Howard, thank you so much.



She bowed to him.

When she looked up again, she noticed a different look in Lucius's eyes,something deeper.

Amelia felt a bit uneasy.

This was the first time she'd seen Lucius like this.

"No problem." He suddenly smiled, jokingly saying, "Ill just treat it like watching a show."


And he was also making moves on a chessboard.

In the blink of an eye, four years passed.

At the airport.

A young woman in her prime, dressed in a flowing dark green gown,
appeared gracefully in the crowd1. Her stunning beauty immediately caught everyone's attention, and people couldn't look away.


Not to mention her striking features under her sunglasses or her figure that sparked imagination, just her extraordinary aura was stunning.

"Is that Bella White, the famous painter? Can I get an autograph?"


Someone shouted, and in an instant, fans and non-fans alike swarmed over.


Bella didn't dodge, clearly used to such enthusiasm. She skillfully signed autographs and took photos with fans with her sunglasses on.

Then, she walked into the parking lot in her four-inch red high heels.

"Ms. White, Mr. Howard has alreadly booked the restaurant and is waiting for you," her assistant Sable said with a perfect smile.


Bella finally took< off her sunglasses, revealing her bright eyes.

"Alright, let's get moving." She pulled out a tissue to wipe the dust off her sunglasses, her nude-colored nail polish looking fresh and lively.

Sable watched her through the rearview mirror.


Bella was flawless from head to toe, even a single strand of hair screamed elegance and wealth. She was truly dazzling.

Only someone like her could stand next to Lucius.

They drove out of the airport, and the view outside became broader.

Bella quietly looked at the scenery outside the car window, both familiar and strange.
Her exquisite face showed a hint of melancholy.

It had been four years.

Time flew by so quickly.

It feels like everything has changed, but nothing has really changed.

But this time, she was well-prepared.

"Ms. White, someone is following us," Sable suddenly said.

"Shake them off." Bella instantly became alert and glanced back.


With just one look, she recognized that familiar Porsche 918, Chris's favorite car.


She didn't plan to meet him so soon.

Sable followed her instructions and sped up.

But her skills were limited and no match for Chris.

They quickly entered a busy area, and as the red light turned on, there was only a black business car between the two vehicles,perfectly blocking the view.


"Let's switch seats; I'll drive." Bella's voice was calm, without a trace of panic.


Sable instinctively agreed, only realizing how obedient she had been after getting õut of the car, even though she only ever took orders from Lucius.

"Ms. White, could you slow..." Before Sable could finish her sentence,the light turned green, and the car sped off, making her heart race.
She quickly grabbed the hanadle, her face turning pale with fear. "Slow down, please!"

She had never driven so fast before! She doubted that her cherished car could handle this speed.

She glanced at Bella, who remained indifferent, her profile as beautiful as a movie star's.

Even though she had seen it many times, she still couldn't look directly at Bella's nearly perfect face, her heart pounding.


"Why panic?" Bella smirked, glancing at the rearview mirror. The car was already a hundred feet behind.

But it wasn't enough.

It would only take a few minutes to catch up.


"Let's see if you can catch me." She grinned wickedly, as if entering the most thrilling virtual game.


She pressed the accelerator, changed lanes, and turned right. Her movements were as smooth as silk.


Five minutes later, the car turned into a narrow alley, weaving through twists and turns, finally shaking off Chris.

They arrived at the restaurant just in time.


"Are you alright?" Bella crossed her arms, glancing at the person beside her.


Sable's face was pale, clutching her chest, still recovering from the thrilling ride.
"Well, I think I feel better now." Sable forced a smile. "But Ms. White, can I make a small request?"

"Go ahead."

"Next time you drive, can you not go so fast?" Sable was almost in tears.

She had never felt such intense fear before, her heart nearly jumping out of her chest.

Bella raised an eyebrow and smiled. "Sure."

She would leave next time's matters for next time.

The elevator ascended, soon reaching the 22nd floor.

The doors opened, and they entered,with Sable politely stepping back.

"Mr. Howard." Bella respectfully greeted.
###Chapter 44

Lucius stood quietly by the floor-to-ceiling window, taking in the whole view of Pinecrest.


Time hadn't done much to him. Four years had gone by, and he still looked as classy and friendly as ever. The only difference was the coldness in his eyes had gotten more intense.

When he heard her voice, he turned around slowly.

Their eyes met, and a flicker of interest crossed his face.

"You're back."

Four years, and all he could muster was that simple line.

"You've changed a lot." He motioned for her to sit, then settled onto the sofa himself.


Bella waited for him to sit, poured him a glass of water, and then took a seat.


"Amelia, are you sure about this?" Lucius looked up at Bella. Her change was significant.


She had gone from a timid little kitten to a strong, independent woman.The fear in her eyes was gone, replaced by determination and calm.

Yep,this Bella was actually Amelia, who had been missing for four years.

If it weren't for some unexpected twist, she might never have come back.

But this time,she had no choice.
"Yes." She pressed her lips together, "Mr. Howard, you know I don't have any other options."

"So, what should I call you?" The smile faded from Lucius's eyes, "Amelia or Bella?"


Amelia was momentarily taken aback. Bella White was the identity Lucius had set up for her, and it was rock solid. No one would ever find out.

"Bella, I guess." Saying the name stung a bit, "If we're gonna do this, we should do it right, don't you think?"

Lucius gave her a cool look but said nothing.

"Oh, by the way." Amelia remembered something and looked annoyed, "I saw him. He probably suspects something."

Lucius took a sip of water, "It's normal for him to be suspicious. He never accepted that Amelia was dead."

Amelia was stunned, shock in her eyes.

Lucius continued, "After you left, I.set up a fake corpse to cover it up,but Chris didn't buy it. He spent a long;time looking for you, even following me and questioning me."

"He really knows how to put on a show." Amelia scoffed.

"Maybe only he knows if it's an act." Lucius waved it off, "Let's not talk about himn. Since you're set on this, stick to your plan. For now,focus on your art exhibition. I'll invite some people over."

Amelia nodded and left.

Downstairs, as she headed to the garage to get her car, she noticed a 3D
billboard on the mall across the street showing a familiar face.

It was Leila.

Four years had passed, and Leila had become a huge star. Even when Amelia was in Zephyria, she heard about her.


Six months ago, Leila got engaged to Chris.


No surprise there.Chris and Leila had been inseparable and madly in love back then.


They would probably get married soon.


But that had limited impact on her plan. Amelia looked away and went to the house she had set up beforehand, not far from Lucius's place, in a nice suburban villa area.


Meanwhile.

"What's up?" Chris's lazy voice came through, sounding a bit impatient.

On the other end of the line, Ryder sounded a bit nervous, "Ms. Ross said she made dinner for you."


"So?" Chris hung up the phone without another word.

He hit the gas and sped down the road.


Thinking about that fleeting glimpse of a figure at the airport, irritation surged through him.


Over the past few years, he had scoured Pinecrest, even traveled abroad countless times. He had often spot figures that looked like Amelia,but up close, it was never her.
Everyone told him Amelia was gone, her remains buried in the Spencer family cemetery, but he didn't believe it. He never even went to the cemetery.

But the figure he saw today was different. It was too similar. Even from a distance, it shook him.


He felt a wave of frustration.

Before he knew it, he was driving through the suburbs, just a mile or two from the cemetery.

Since he was already here, he might as well take a look.

Chris parked the car outside and walked in alone.

Amelia's young, vibrant face was etched on the cold tombstone, with a bouquet of fresh flowers placed in front by some kind soul.

Looking at the photo, Chris felt a pang of bitterness.

Suddenly, he chuckled softly. "Damn Amelia, you fooled so many people.But you can't fool me."

Chris lowered his head, touching the cold tombstone, the figure he saw today flashing in his mind again.

He quickly returned home, and a call came in.

Chris glanced at it,annoyed.

It was Nolan.

"Hey, Chris, did you know Bella White is back? The woman your uncle Lucius is so fond of. He's over thirty and still hasn't married, supposedly
because of Bella, We all want to see her, Why don't you come along?"Nolan's voice was full of curiosity.

"Not interested," Chris was frritated and ready to hang up.

Nolan hurriedly said, "Don't be so quick to decide. After all,she's your future aunt. You should at least take a look. Although she isn't officially scheduled to arrive for another two weeks, I will get to see her tomorrow.Come with me."

"No." This time, Chris didn't say another word and hung up.

The next day at the CanvasCove Art Gallery.

Amelia was directing the workers for the final cleaning.

This gallery was on the ground floor of a downtown mall,taking up a quarter of the floor. The moment one stepped into the mall, it was the first thing that caught the eye.

Before coming back, she had people decorate it for two or three months. It wasn't until last week that she started moving in the paintings she hadn't planned to sell over the years.

She named the gallery.

Outside the gallery.

"Shawn, when did you meet her? She looks so elegant and refined." Nolan was hiding in a boutique across from the gallery, staring intently at the busy figure not far away, expressing his admiration.

A hint of sadness flashed in Shawn's eyes, but he stayed calm, "You know my best friend is Lucius. That's my future sister-in-law. Of course,I've
seen her more than once."

Over the years, Shawn occasionally traveled abroad,visiting Amelia in Zephyria. Each time he went, he noticed her changing more.

The current Amelia seemed like the naturally grown-up version of the competitive, strong, and aloof girl she used to be.

As Nolan said, she was truly elegant and refined, exuding an artistic aura that set her apart from ordinary people.
###Chapter 45
Amelia was no longer the naive, timid girl who had disappeared years ago. She stood in the center of the gallery, radiating a confidence that was as striking as the art on the walls.
"Let me take a quick photo," Nolan grinned, tapping his phone. "I’ve got to show Chris the woman who’s taking the city by storm."
Shawn tried to intervene, but Nolan had already captured a side profile of Amelia as she turned to greet a guest.
Nolan stared at the screen, his expression shifting from amusement to confusion. "Why does she look so familiar? Is this Bella White? I feel like I've seen her somewhere before."
"Don't you think she bears a resemblance to Amelia?" Shawn raised an eyebrow, testing the waters.
Nolan’s eyes widened. "What are you saying? Amelia is a name from the past. Besides, they might share a face, but their vibes are worlds apart. Bella is untouchable—like a queen."
Shawn remained silent, a small, knowing smile playing on his lips.

Spencer Group Headquarters.
Chris sat in the executive chair, his expression unreadable as the HR director presented the latest personnel reports. The atmosphere in the conference room was stifling, as it always was when the CEO was in one of his moods.
Suddenly, Chris’s phone buzzed. He glanced at the notification—a photo from Nolan. He froze, his entire body tensing as he stood up abruptly, knocking his chair back.
The room went deathly silent. The HR director wiped sweat from his brow, wondering what part of the hiring budget had triggered such a reaction.
"Mr. Spencer, is everything alright?"
Chris didn't answer. He walked out of the room, leaving his executives in a state of bewilderment. He climbed into his car and floored the gas, heading straight for the location Nolan had sent.
In ten minutes, his Porsche screeched to a halt outside the mall. He looked up and saw the sign: CanvasCove Art Gallery. He passed this building every day, yet he hadn't noticed this new addition until now.
Just as he stepped toward the entrance, a figure walked out. It was the woman from the airport.
Up close, the resemblance was haunting. She had Amelia’s features, but they were sharpened by an artistic flair and a captivating presence he had never seen in his wife. His heart pounded against his ribs. Amelia, if you’re alive... why haven't you come home?

The Grand Opening.
The gallery was packed. Lucius Howard had ensured that the elite of the city were in attendance. The mall had even opened early to manage the crowds drawn by the debut of the mysterious artist, Bella White.
Amelia wore a sophisticated silk gown in shades of emerald and seafoam, paired with elegant black heels. Her makeup was flawless, highlighting her refined features without being overdone.
"You look breathtaking today," Shawn said as he arrived with Nolan.
Amelia nodded gracefully. "Welcome. I’m glad you could make it."
Nolan couldn't take his eyes off her. "You really are..."
Before he could say something reckless, Shawn pulled him away. Over the last two years, Shawn had grown into a formidable businessman in his own right, moving past his rebellious racing days.
"Stop staring, Nolan. It’s unprofessional," Shawn hissed. "Is Chris coming?"
"He's on his way," Nolan replied, finally looking away. "But wait—since when are you and Lucius Howard so close? You’re acting like his right-hand man."
Shawn didn't answer, his attention shifting to Lucius as he entered the room. Every head turned. Lucius moved through the crowd with an easy grace, eventually reaching Amelia’s side. She naturally took his arm, and they shared a look of mutual understanding that looked, to any observer, like the picture-of-a-perfect-power-couple.
"Chris is here. Stay sharp," Lucius whispered.
A cold light flashed in Amelia’s eyes. "Thank you for the warning, Lucius."
As the clock struck ten, Amelia stepped to the podium. She delivered her speech with a natural eloquence, her voice steady and her gaze sweeping the room. The audience listened in rapt silence, applauding at all the right moments.
Despite the crowd, she could feel one specific gaze burning into her.
"I swear, she’s a ringer for Amelia," Nolan muttered to Shawn. "Am I losing my mind?"
"You're just seeing ghosts," Shawn replied coolly. He wasn't worried. With Lucius’s backing, Amelia’s new identity was ironclad—a talented artist who had spent years abroad, now returning to her roots to open her own space. It was a flawless resume.
Amelia and Lucius began to move through the room, toasting their guests. When they reached Shawn and Nolan, Amelia smiled brightly.
"Ms. White, you’ve truly outdone yourself," Nolan said, clinking his glass against hers. "Lucius, you finally found your muse. When’s the wedding?"
A hint of warmth appeared in Lucius’s eyes. "We aren't in any rush."
"We’ll be sure to send you an invitation when the time is right," Amelia added with a charming smile.
As they moved on, Nolan’s smile faded into a thoughtful frown. "What now?" Shawn asked.
"Something feels off," Nolan whispered. "They don't feel like lovers. They feel like partners in a very high-stakes game."
"Don't overthink it," Shawn warned.
"Look, the star has arrived!" Nolan’s eyes lit up as a slender, exquisite figure appeared at the entrance. It was Leila Ross.
###Chapter 46

"Hey everyone," Leila said, taking off her sunglasses and flashing her trademark smile, instantly grabbing everyone's attention.


Amelia noticed her too but stayed cool, watching as Leila mingled with the crowd like she owned the place.


Finally, Leila made her way over, smiling. "Ms. White, nice to meet you."

Leila extended her hand, locking eyes with Amelia.


Amelia gave a polite smile and shook her hand. "Hello, Ms. Ross. I've heard a lot about you. You really live up to the hype."


Her tone was flat, showing she was used to these kinds of social events and the formalities that came with them.


As their hands met, Amelia felt Leila's palm was sweaty.

Their eyes met, and Leila's voice dropped to a whisper, "Are you Ms.White or Ms. Tudor? I can't tell."


The moment Leila walked into the gallery and saw Bella, she was struck.

Logic told her Amelia was long gone, a victim of her own schemes.

But Bella looked so much like Amelia, especially her features.

"You're not the first to ask, and you won't be the last, but my patience is wearing thin. I don't want to explain it every time." Amelia said coolly,trying to pull her hand back, but Leila held on tight.

With two stunning women in the same frame, the media outside went wild.snapping photos like crazy.
"Aren't you Amelia?" Lella smirked, "You better not be, because Chris and I are engaged, and no one can come between us."

"Seems like Ms. Ross is a bit insecure about her fiancé," Amelia raised an eyebrow, a flicker of disdain in her eyes. Taking advantage of Leila's distraction, she yanked her hand free.


She called over a waiter and wiped her hands with a warm towel right in front of everyone.

The crowd buzzed with shock.

Wasn't this a blatant insult?

Rumor had it Bella was tough to deal with, had a bad temper, and only smiled around Lucius. Guess the rumors were true.


"You..." Leila's face turned red with anger.

Amelia just smiled lightly, "Ms. Ross,why embarrass yourself?"

With that,she walked away.

But Leia wasn't done, "Ms. White, I have a painting here I'd like you to check out. See if it's one of your early works."

She clapped her hands, and two people brought in a painting covered with a red cloth.


Everyone looked confused.

Leila pulled off the cloth, revealing the painting in front of everyone.

"Who's in the painting? He looks so familiar."
"The painting is incredible. Is it Ms. White's work?"

"What's she trying to do, ruin the gallery opening?"

Amelia recognized it immediately; it was a painting she had sold when she was desperate. It showed Chris's back.


It turned out Leila had bought it.

No wonder the buyer was so generous; offering five million dollars.

"Sorry, I've never painted this." She shook her head slightly, "If Ms. Ross is in a bad mood, there's some dessert over there. I'll be excusing myself."


"Ms. White, are you afraid of facing your past?" Leila's voice suddenly rose,sharp and challenging.

Amelia paused for a moment.

She turned her head, looking at Leila like she was a joke. "My past? Ms.Ross, can you be straightforward with me?"


Leila was about to speak when she noticed Lucius nearby, and her body tensed up.

But she still pushed forward, "Amelia, don't think changing your looks will make you unrecognizable."


All eyes were on Amelia.

"Amelia?" She looked genuinely confused, "Who's that?"

The crowd was shocked. What was Leila talking about? Why would she create problems on the gallery's opening day?
Leila noticed the unfriendly stares but still stepped closer, lowering her voice, "Don't think I don't know what you're up to, you..."


"Security." Amelia had enough. She glanced at the plainclothes bodyguard beside her, "This lady's had too much to drink. Please escort her out to rest."


Leila's face darkened, "Amelia, one day you'll slip up!"

Her only comfort now was getting engaged to Chris early.

When Victor was seriously ill and worried Chris had no heirs, she proposed the engagement, and Chris eventually agreed.

But even though she often called herself Chris's fiancée, he never acknowledged it publicly, making her anxious.

Now with Bella around, Leila was especially worried she'd mess things up.

This little drama was soon forgotten. After a few rounds of drinks,guests started buying their favorite artworks.


"Your paintings are excellent." Lucius said, holding a wine glass and smiling, "A lot of people here like them. You should be happy."


Amelia smiled politely, but there was some anxiety in her eyes because Chris hadn't taken the bait yet.

Everything she did today was for him.

She wanted to get close to him, attract him, and get what she wanted as quickly as possible, no matter the cost, before he figured out her true intentions


So she had to take it carefully.
"Don't worry." Lucius held her wrist, comforting her, "What's meant to happen will happen. Just relax."

Amelia realized she was losing her cool, took a deep breath, "I see."


As the opening ceremony wrapped up, guests started saying their goodbyes, and Amelia finally felt a bit relieved.


Today was just about making a reappearance, showing up with a new identity.


Until the last guest left.

"Ms. White, a guest just bought your painting 'Moonlight' for fiftymillion dollars." The sales associate ran over, her voice trembling with excitement.

Amelia was stunned.


Who was so generous? Her painting was only priced at three hundred thousand dollars.


"The guest wants to see you. He's in the second-floor reception room." As the sales associate finished speaking, Amelia already had a guess.

As she expected, he had taken the bait.

She took a deep breath, informed Lucius, and went up to the second floor alone.


The door was half-open, and through the crack, she saw a tall, straight figure. Who else could it be but Chris?

Amelia's breathing hitched. She bit her lip and knocked on the door.

Chris paused for a moment and then spoke slowly, "Come in."
Only then did she step inside.

The place where he stood seemed to radiate a powerful chill,making the air feel icy, sending a shiver through Amelia's heart.
###Chapter 47

"Hi, Mr. Spencer, I heard you bought my painting 'Moonlight.' Thanks a lot." Amelia smiled, standing quietly behind Chris, watching his back.

It had been four years since they last saw each other.

He had changed, yet somehow he hadn't.


He was much thinner now, standing there like a cool protagonist straight out of a comic book.


"Just a verbal thank you?" Chris turned around slowly, a dangerous glint in his deep eyes.


Amelia's gaze turned cold, her demeanor calm, "So, what does Mr.Spencer want?"


Before she could finish, Chris started walking towards her, his eyes locking onto hers like he was trying to see through her soul.

"Why did you avoid me that day?" He suddenly changed the topic, "It's been years, and your driving skills have improved a lot. Did you learn from Shawn?"


Amelia smiled faintly, "I don't understand what you are talking about, Mr.Spencer."


Chris had already walked up to her, but he didn't stop. He kept approaching,forcing her to step back.

The polite smile on Amelia's face disappeared, a hint of displeasure flashing in her eyes, "It seems Mr. Spencer doesn't truly appreciate my painting and is just using it as an excuse to humiliate me. I have no idea
how I offended you. Why don't you just tell me directly?"

The next second. Chris suddenly stepped forward, grabbing her shoulder.forcing her to meet his cold, sharp gaze.

Their eyes met, and Amelia's eyes were full of impatience,"Let go of me!"

But she couldn't escape.

Chris stared at her, speaking word by word, "I knew you weren't dead,Amelia. What are you pretending?"


Amelia's heart tightened, almost making her lose her composure.


But she laughed. "Mr. Spencer's fiancée just caused me trouble, and now you're here too. It seems neither of you plans to let me go. Did I do something wrong?"


Amelia looked at him with a half-smile, her gaze unwavering.

"My patience is limited." Chris suddenly pushed her. She was unprepared.stumbling back several steps, almost falling until her back hit the wall.

"You're with Lucius?" He seemed to sense a change in her aura, "It's only been a few years, Amelia, and you're still a hussy!"

Amelia's heart tightened abruptly.

Hussy?

She didn't expect that after alI these years, he still saw her as despicable.

Amelia sneered, "I thought Mr. Spencer was truly as noble and self-restrained as people say, but I didn't expect you to be such trash."
Although she was in a lower position, she seemed to become the dominator of their relationship, glancing at his pale face, "I really feel sorry for your ex-wife. She's dead, and yet you still humiliate her like this."

"You..."

"I'm Bella White, not Amelia. Mr. Spencer, please mind your manners."Amelia quickly crouched down, escaping from his grasp.


"Stop!" Chris took a quick step and blocked her, "I'lI give you one last chance, Amelia. Don't force me to get physical."

Amelia crossed her arms, a contemptuous smile on her lips, "I had no idea there were men who would get physical with women. It seems Mr.Spencer doesn't live up to his reputation."

She turned to leave, "I won't sell my painting to someone as low-class as you, Mr. Spencer. I don't think we will meet again."

It wasn't until her figure disappeared that Chris finally looked away. Well played, Amelia. You sure know how to keep people on their toes. If that's what you want, I'll play along and see who can keep it up the longest.'

Ryder walked in, holding a file. "Mr. Spencer, I've got the info.She's Bella White. No known parents. She grew up in an orphanage with Lucius until she was ten. Then Lucius got adopted by Mr. Victor Spencer. She vanished for thirteen years. Two years ago, Lucius found her in Zephyria, and by then,she was a painter."

Ryder's yoice was steady, but there was a hint of helplessness.

Chris took the file and read through it carefully, not missing a single detail,and gradually felt more agitated.







-
"Mr. Spencer, she isn't Mrs. Spencer," Ryder reminded cautiously.

Chris shot him a cold glare, making Ryder shiver and not dare to say more.

But he couldn't stand it anymore.

Over the years, he knew better than anyone what happended..

Chris seemed indifferent, but he was deeply trapped in past memories,unable to move on, suffering from severe sleep disorders. Even after more than a year of treatment, he still needed sleeping pills to fall asleep.


Several times, Ryder had been by his side and heard Chris sadly calling Amelia' in his sleep.

"Ryder, you've seen her, more than once." Chris looked up, a glimmer of hope in his eyes, "Don't youa realize that Bella is Amelia?"

Ryder felt particularly troubled.

He wanted to lie, but he couldn't.


He couldn't lie when faced with the truth. Bella was a well-known painter and Lucius's girlfriend. How could she be Amelia?


"Mr. Spencer, think about it," Ryder mentioned carefully, "If she were Mrs.Spencer,how could Mr. Howard be with her and help her with today's art exhibition, introducing her to the crowd?"

Chris was stunned.

Yes, he knew Lucius's character.

But still, deep down, he felt that Bella was actually Amelia.
"I don't believe it." After a long silence, Chris opened his eyes, and a flash of unwillingness quickly crossed his gaze.

"Go find Leila," he said.

In less than twenty minutes, Leila appeared in front of him.

She had changed her clothes, her eyes filled with unease, "Chris, were you here just now?"


She cautiously probed, afraid that Chris would be angry at her actions.

"Yes, I saw everything you did." Chris slowly looked up, his gaze as cold as ice.


Leila's face turned pale, her voice trembling, "Chris, I just heard she was a great painter and wanted to have a visit. I meant no harm."

Subconseiously,she still thought Chris loved Amelia and didn't dare to overstep.

"Who do you think she is?" Chris asked, his eyes filled with scrutiny.

Leila paused for a second, then immediately realizing that Chris wasn't blaming her.


"I think she looks a bit like Amelia, but not really. Amelia was like a coward,but Bella dared to embarrass me in public. She has a bad temper."She pouted, still observing Chris's expression.

He remained silent.

Leila continued, "Besides, if she were Amelia, how could she be with Mr.Howard?"
Chris's gaze suddenly became sharp, "You can leave now."

Leila quickly stepped forward, wrapping her arms around his, "Chris, have dinner with me tonight. I've waited for you so many times. Have you forgotten we are already engaged?"
###Chapter 48

Before she could finish, Chris suddenly glanced over.

Their eyes locked, and Leila's face went stiff again.


"Grandpa's already better, you don't need to lie to him," he said coldly. "Besides, he doesn't really like you."


"But I saved you, and I love youso much, can't you just..."

"I've given you everything you've asked for all these years," Chris said,looking impatient. "Don't push it, and don't cause her any more trouble."

Thanks to Lucius's connections, Amelia's gallery quickly became a hit in the art scene.


Every day, visitors and fellow artists streamed in, bringing her a good income.


Amelia grew more confident, greeting guests in the mornings and spending the quieter afternoons and evenings in her office, focused on her painting.

She had gotten used to this peaceful, solitary time.

But someone seemed determined to disrupt her tranquility.

That afternoon,Lucius dropped by with a dessert.

Amelia was sitting by the floor-to-ceiling window, painting the beautiful sunset outside.


She wore a dark green dress, the hem flowing down her slender legs, the silk fabric catching the orange-red sunlight, making her skin look fairer
and giving her an even stronger artistic vibe.

"Have something to eat," Lucius said gently, placing the dessert on the table next to her.

Amelia stretched,got up, walked over to him, and opened her arms for台hug.

Lucius smiled indulgently, pinched her cheek, and gently embraced her.

"Did you make any sales today?" he asked as he opened the dessert box and set the utensils for her.


Amelia washed her hands and walked back leisurely. As she was about to sit down, she noticed someone quietly watching her from the comer of the gallery, and she felt quite annoyed. "Mr. Spencer, what exactly do you want? You've been here most of the day. Don't you have your own business?"


Since her gallery opened, Chris had been dropping by every day.sometimes for just a few minutes, sometimes for the entire afternoon.Today was the longest; he had been there since morning and still hadn't left.


She did want to get close to him, but his behavior was really puzzlíng.

"What,you're doing business and want to drive customers away?" Chris stared at Amelia, ignoring Lucius standing nearby.′′I′m a big client of your gallery, can't you show a little more courtesy?"

At this, Amelia got angry.

She had made it clear to Chris that she wasn't selling that painting,but he insisted on having it. Over the past few days, he had bought several
paintings, each costing anywhere from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. She wondered if he had so much money that he was just looking for ways to waste it.

"I said, you're not welcome here!" Amelia glared at him. "And if I remember correctly, I'm your future aunt!"


Chris frowned. "You've found yourself a new identity so quickly?" he said,enunciating each word. "Do you think the Spencer family would agree to let an orphan marry in?"

"That's my business," Lucius deadpanned. "Chris, stop it. She has work to do."


His tone was like an elder scolding a disobedient junior.

Chris's face changed slightly. He took a deep breath, suppressing the turmoil in his eyes.

"Lucius, you know exactly who she is," he said, stepping closer to Lucius. "You were the one who took her away back then."


"Enough!" Lucius snapped, his voice cold. "Ill have Dad suspend your position. You need to take a break and reflect."


"Do you even have that authority?" Chris sneered. "Since Grandpa got sick,I've been managing his assets."


"But Dad asked me to supervise you," Lucius shot back, his tone just as unfriendly. "If you act recklessly, I have the right to..."


"I can revoke your right anytime. Keeping you around is just to reassure Grandpa," Chris sneered again. "Do you really think I'm afraid of you?"
The two had been at each other's throats for a while,neither able to gain the upper hand.

"Alright, if he won't leave, we will," Amelia spid, sensing the tension rising.She grabbed Lucius's arm and pulled him away,

For several days in a row, even before she opened the gallery. Chris's Porsche was already parked outside the mall, making a statemnent.

Rumors started flying around that Chris had fallen for his future aunt at first sight, saying she resembled his deceased wife, which made him particularly attached to her.

It was utterly ridiculous.

Amelia tried avoiding him for two days but couldn't shake him off, so she decided to confront him.


She didn't expect Victor to show up today as well.

"She does look a bit like her," Victor said, glancing at Amelia thoughtfully."But not her. Chris, what are you doing?"

Victor was clearly pissed.

Chris's face stiffened slightly, but he seemed prepared for this. "Grandpa.could you please go back first? I have something to talk to her."


"Bella, don't take it personally. He's been through a lot and needs time to recover. He'll be fine after a while," Victor said gently.

It was the first time in years that Amelia had seen Victor, and she felt a warmth in her heart, but she didn't show it. She just smiled appropriately and saw him out.
"Mr. Spencer, what else do you want?" she asked.

Chris's voice was deep. "Have dinner with me."

"And you won't bother me anymore?" Amelia raised an eyebrow, looking at him challengingly.

Chris was silent for a moment. "You have no right to negotiate with me."

They had dinner at a very elegant restaurant.

The environment was great, and the food was top-notch, but...

Chris pointed to the mashed potatoes with blueberry saucein front of Amelia. "Why isn't Ms. White eating?"

Amelia was allergic to potatoes.

With a single bite, she would break out in large red rashes, and in severe cases, she could go into shock.

"I don't like blueberries," she said casually. "The steak is just fine."


Chris was a lover of fine cuisine and had several top chefs at home. He could have the dish he liked at any time. "Don't miss out on the mashed potatoes; they're a must-try," Chris said, putting down his utensils and watching her quietly.

It seemed he was determined to make her eat it.

Amelia pursed her lips, resigned, and took a small bite.

The properly seasoned mashed potatoes quickly melted in her mouth,very delicate. "Not bad," she said, taking another small bite.
"Why don't you try?" She asked with a suspicious smile. "Mr. Spencer has such a small appetite, no wonder you're so thin."

Chris had indeed lost a lot of weight. His already defined features were even more pronounced, and compared to a few years ago, he had a sharper, more somber aura.
###Chapter 49

He observed her quietly, saying nothing.A few minutes passed, and she finished eating.


"Mr. Spencer, thank you for the dinner." She elegantly wiped her mouth,stood up, and picked up her bag. "I hope Mr. Spencer will keep you word and don't show up again."

Her act of playing 'hard to get' was well-executed, and everything was going according to plan.

But he chased after her, grabbed her bag, and pushed her out, "I'll take you home."

Amelia didn't refuse, smiling generously, "Alright, thank you, Mr. Spencer."


The atmosphere in the car was particularly strange on the way.

Occasionally, when they stopped at the traffic light, he would glance at her from the corner of his eye.

She remained as elegant as ever, quietly sitting in the passenger seat,occasionally glancing at the scenery flying past the window.

Since she decided to start over, how could she possibly let any traces of the past remain on her? In her first year in Zephyria, she had been trying to eat potatoes, each time just a little bit, gradually increasing the amount.

At first,her reaction was as severe as before, breaking out in painful and itchy rashes, and scratching hard would leave marks.

But gradually, her OIT began to show results. Her body's reactions became less and less severe, and finally, after a year, she no longer experienced any
allergic reactions.

She didn't expect it would actually come in handy.

"Impressive." As she was about to leave, Chris smiled faintly, his gaze sweeping across her face, "You really go to any lengths."


Amelia pretended not to hear the underlying meaning in his words and didn't care, "Mr. Spencer is no different."


Even after walking a long distance, she could still feel a burning gaze fixed on her back.


Countless times before, she had also watched his back as he left.

Now, the roles were completely reversed, and the changes in fate were truly remarkable.

From that day on, Chris almost never came by again, and this continued for a week.

Amelia was thinking about how to appropriately pull back the person she had pushed away.

Coincidentally, that afternoon, Lucius came to pick up Amelia, saying he wanted to take her home for dinner.

"Does Grandpa still hold the tradition of organizing family dinners every month?" Amelia was a bit worried, "I haven't seen him in a long time.Would it be inappropriate to go suddenly?"

Lucius smiled noncommittally,"No, he will only welcome you. Besides.you need to provoke Chris more."

Amelia nodded.
As long as she could see Chris, she was willing to appear at any occasion.

In the evening, almost all the elders and juniors of the Spencer family were present, with a few children running around in the living room.

The moment Lucius and Amelia showed up, everyone's eyes turned to them.


Victor waved at them, "Come over here, let me take a good look at Lucius's girlfriend."

Amelia obediently walked over and sat next to Victor.

"Mr. Victor Spencer, how is your health?" She askedsoftly.

Victor stroked his white beard and laughed, "I'm pretty good. You are a nice girl, no wonder Lucius has been looking for you for so many years."

Amelia smiled at Lucius, and when their eyes met, it really did have a bit of the feeling of a couple in love.

"Grandpa, who is she?" A clear female voice rang out, it was Stella.

Once upon a time, when Stella was a little girl, she looked down on Amelia,thinking she tainted her brother. Now, even though years had passed and she had become an intern doctor, she still didn't hold a good attitude towards Amelia.

Amelia instinctively turned her head, meeting Stella's astonished eyes.

"You, you're Amelia?" Stella was very surprised, "Weren't you dead?"


This Stella was still so stupid.

"What nonsense are you talking about?" Victor glared at her, "She is your
future aunt. apologize now."

Stella was stunned, looking at Lucius in disbelief, "Uncle Lucius, is this true?"


She had heard that Lucius had brought a woman back, but hadn't officially met her. It was hard to imagine that this woman looked so much like Amelia, almost indistinguishable.


However,this woman had more temperament and was more refined than Amelia.


"It's true." Lucius's voice was cold, with a hint of displeasure.

Stella hurriedly said to Amelia, "I'm sorry, I misspoke just now."


Amelia smiled faintly, "That's fine, many people have mistaken me for someone else, I'm used to it."


"Why hasn't Chris come back yet? Call him, he must be here for the family dinner." Victor instructed.


It wasn't time to start the dinner yet, the family sat in groups chatting.and Amelia walked in the garden with Lucius.

"You've already gained the trust of eighty percent of the people, what's your plan next?" Lucius asked, one hand in his pocket.

Amelia's breath hitched, and she remained silent for a long time.

Her plan was clearly proceeding step by step, but why did she still feel so resistant subconsciously?

What kind of feelings did she still have for Chris?
Love? The feeling of love was already faint.

Hate? It didn't seem like she hated him much either.

"Maybe tonight, there will be progress." After a long silence,she spoke softly.


At this moment, she caught sight of Chris and Leila approaching.

"Hi, Ms. White,long time no see." Leila, holding Chris's arm, greeted Amelia sweetly.


The beautiful star attracted everyone's attention as soon as she appeared.

Amelia looked at her.

In the sunlight, Leila's face seemed to sparkle with tiny lights, her smile was beautiful, lively, and flawless.

But Amelia inexplicably felt a sense of decadence from Leila.

"Ms. Ross, you look as radiant as ever." Amelia's tone was flat, her gaze sliding over Leila's face to Chris beside her.


Chris didn't speak.

"Chris, when can I move in here? The houses here are much prettier than where we live now." Leila looked at the luxurious building behind them with anticipation.

Chris smiled indifferently, "Anytime."

"Great, how about tonight?" Leila jumnped up, holding Chris's arm like a young girl in love.
"Okay." Chris responded.

As he passed by Amelia, he suddenly said, "Ms. White, thisis your first time here, right? Feel free to walk around and take a look,after all,you'll be living here in the future."


This place was actually an estate, with over a dozen villas, providing ample space for the entire Spencer family to live in.


Victor had previously stipulated that the Spencer family children, whether male or female, must live at home for a period after marriage before they were allowed to move out.


"Of course." Amelia maintained a perfectly appropriate smile.

The show was about to begin.
###Chapter 50

Dinner kicked off in no time.

Amelia was sitting to Victor's left, with Lucius on her other side. Across from her were Leila and Chris. The rest of the Spencer clan filled in their usual spots, making the whole scene feel pretty cozy.

"Alright, everyone, let's raise our glasses," Victor said, grinning.

Everyone stood up, drinks in hand, and toasted to Victor.

Amelia got up too, holding a glass of red wine. The deep red liquid swirled around, giving off a rich, complex bouquet.

Chris couldn't take his eyes off her.

Amelia wasn't much of a drinker before.

She'd get tipsy after just one glass, so Chris's friends always found it amusing to get her drunk and watch her squirm.

But tonight, she downed half a glass of that strong red wine in one go.

A maid came over and topped off her glass.

"Here, have some food," Lucius said softly,placing a piece of beef on her plate.

The beef was tender and delicious. Amelia ate quietly, but she noticed Leila serving Chris some food out of the corner of her eye.

"Chris, try this fish. It's amazingly succulent," Leila said sweetly,practically hanging onto Chris.
"Uncle Lucius, when are you and Ms. White tying the knot? Grandpa's been itching for grandkids forever. You're keeping us on edge," a female voice suddenly piped up from the table.


It was Stella. She put down her fork and gave Amelia a look that seemed to say a lot.


Lucius stayed calm but held Amelia's hand. After a moment, he said, "It'll be within the next year or two. It also depends on Amelia."


Amelia played along perfectly, flashing a just-right smile. "Once we set a date, we'll let everyone know right away."

Everyone got the hint and responded enthusiastically,their faces lighting up with smiles and laughter.


"Chris, you and Ms. Ross have been engaged for half a year,but it was just a family dinner. You didn't even invite friends and relatives. Isn't that a bit rushed?" Stella turned to Chris again. "You won't let Ms. Ross feel slighted,will you?"

Leila's face went a bit pale.

Engagement? At that dinner, Chris had shown up and left in under two minutes. It hardly counted as an engagement party.

He'd just had someone announce the news publicly.

"Both your brother and I are swamped with work. Since everyone already knows, there's no need to make a big fuss," Leila said carefully,choosing her words.

Unexpectedly, Chris said, "It was a bit rushed. I'll make it up to you later."
His voice was as cold and indifferent as ever, showing no emotion.

Amelia heard this and felt a jolt in her heart.

What did he mean by that?

Was he feeling guilty about slighting Leila and planning to make it up to her with a proper engagement ceremony?

How thoughtful and considerate!

Amelia gripped her utensils tightly, feeling a dull ache in her chest.

She hadn't completely healed from those old wounds over the years.

Every time she faced him, the pain reminded her of how deeply she had loved him and how cruel he had been.


"Uncle Lucius, Ms. White, I hope you can attend," Chris suddenly said with a faint smile, his eyes locked on Amelia as if trying to read her.

Amelia's smile almost faltered, but she forced herself to keep it. "Of course,don't forget to send us an invite."

Her voice was clear and pure, without a hint of anything else.

But for some reason, the atmospherein the big dining room suddenly got chilly.

The meal ended up being pretty awkward.

Lucius got called away for business, saying he had to head out to Oceancrest City. He bid farewell to Victor, who then turned to Amelia and suggested she stay a few more days at the Spencer Mansion, since she was already there,to keep him company.Amelia didn't hesitate to agree.
She hadn't spent much time with Victor, and despite using a different name, she felt a strong desire to be there for him and make up for lost time.


"I don't know where you came from, you shameless hussy. You claim to be Bella, but who really knows if you are or not? Maybe you had plastic surgery to look like that bitch Amelia. Seducing Lucius wasn't enough, and now you want to seduce my Chris. You're disgusting!"

A woman's sarcastic voice came from behind her,mixed with the sound of high heels clicking on the ground.


Amelia turned around and quietly lookedat the beautiful Leila standing in front of her.


Behind Amelia was a stunning rose garden, personally planted and carefully tended by Victor. When Amelia used to live at the Spencer Mansion; she often helped Victor with these flowers and plants, gaining some experience.


"You surprise me. I never expected you to have a knack for gardening. No wonder Grandpa values you so much. But what exactly do you want?What are you trying to gain by getting close to Grandpa?" Leila approached step by step, her eyes cold and almost piercing through Amelia.


Amelia found it boring and continued watering the roses.

"Ms. Ross, if your relationship with Chris is shaky, you should focus on him instead of always targeting others," she said with a faint smile.indifferent to the provocation.

Leila gritted her teeth in anger. "Don't assume I'm unaware of your
intentions, you bitch, you..."

"Ms. Ross, watch your words," Amelia's voice turned cold. "We're in the Spencer Mansion. You did a lot toensure you could stay here to leave a good impression on Mr. Victor Spencer. Do you doubt my ability to turn him against you completely??"

"Who do you think you are!" Leila sneered, showing disbelief, but still instinctively took two steps back.


Because Bella's face in front of her was at least seventy to eighty percent similar to Amelia's from before, and a few years ago, Victor liked Amelia's gentle nature.


"Are you going to marry Lucius?" Leila was silent for a moment, then changed the subject.

Amelia stopped what she was doing and turned around unexpectedly,just in time to see the fleeting look of probing and unease in Leila's eyes.

"It seems you're quite afraid of me taking Chris away," she said with a faint smile, as if discovering a secret.

"But I'm not interested in him," she said, raising her voice slightly,probably loud enough for Chris behind the garden to hear clearly.

That night, Amelia hung out with Victor in the living room, watching TV for a while. The family doctor came to urge Victor to rest, and a maid led Amelia to a guest room upstairs.

The layout of this room was almost identical to the one she used to live in on the third floor. Even the furniture was exactly the same.

So when she walked in, Amelia felt a sense of unreality, like she had
stepped back in time to four years ago the moment she opened the door.
###Chapter 51
Victor was a man of rigid military routine. Every night at ten o'clock, the lights in the Spencer mansion were extinguished, casting the grand hallways into deep shadow. When the younger generation moved in, they had no choice but to adapt to his silence.
Thirsty and restless, Amelia used her phone as a flashlight, navigating toward the second-floor kitchen. She had barely taken a few steps when a tall figure emerged from the gloom, standing like a spectral sentinel.
"Who’s there?" she whispered, her heart racing.
"You’re jumpy, Ms. White," Chris’s voice echoed, sounding hollow in the dark. "But in my own house, I’m the one who should be asking the questions."
"Mr. Spencer, lurking in the dark is hardly the behavior of a gentleman," Amelia replied coldly, trying to mask her unease.
"Gentlemanly behavior hasn't gotten me the truth," Chris countered. He didn't wait for her response. He stepped forward, his presence overwhelming as he guided—almost forced—her toward the stairs. "Come with me. There’s something you need to remember."
Before Amelia could protest, they were on the third floor, standing before a door she knew only too well. He pushed it open and led her inside, the heavy click of the lock sounding like a gavel in the silence.
"Do you recognize this room?" Chris loomed over her, his tall frame cutting off the moonlight.
"You’re out of line, Chris!" Amelia snapped, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and indignation. "Look at me! I am Bella White. I am not the woman you lost."
"I don't believe in ghosts, but I believe in my own eyes," Chris’s voice was raw, teetering on a dangerous edge. "Every gesture, every tilt of your head... it all screams her name."
"I am your future aunt," Amelia spat, using her new identity as a shield. "You’ve lost your mind."
Chris let out a low, humorless laugh. "Aunt? You think Lucius Howard’s protection makes you untouchable? You’re as naive as she was."
He moved closer, pinning her into the corner with his shadow. "Four years ago, in this very room, she would have done anything to keep me. She threw away her dignity for a man who didn't even see her."
The memory hit Amelia like a physical blow. She remembered that desperate girl—the one who thought a child could save a dying marriage, the one who had felt utterly worthless after being rejected. But that girl was gone.
"How pathetic you are," Amelia whispered into the darkness. "You claim to know her, yet you only ever looked down on her. If I were Amelia, I would have chosen the car accident over staying another day by your side."
"Silence!" Chris growled, his aura radiating a volatile energy.
"Why? Does the truth sting?" Amelia challenged. "You hurt her until there was nothing left. You treated her like a shadow, an insignificant ghost in your house. And now you’re obsessed with the ghost you created?"
Chris paused, a twisted sort of pride flickering in his tone. "But she loved me. More than anyone else ever could."
Amelia was stunned. He sounded proud of that unrequited devotion, as if her suffering was a trophy he could still claim. "Keep dreaming, Mr. Spencer. I am not here to play a part in your delusions."
She tried to push past him, but Chris didn't move. He leaned in, his face inches from hers, his breath cold against her skin. The tension was suffocating—a silent, aggressive demand for her to break. Amelia didn't flinch. She stared back with a gaze that was as hard as flint.
"I find your obsession... disgusting," she said, her voice a lethal whisper.
She pushed him aside with a strength that surprised them both and walked toward the door. To her shock, Victor was standing in the hallway, his face etched with disappointment.
A few moments later, they were in Victor’s study.
"Grandpa, she is Amelia. She’s deceiving us all," Chris insisted, his voice thick with suppressed fury.
Amelia stood close to Victor, silent and composed. She didn't need to defend herself; the older man was already trembling with rage.
"How long are you going to harass this woman?" Victor sighed, his voice heavy. "She is Bella White. She belongs with Lucius. Even if Amelia were alive, why would she return to a man who never gave her a single day of peace?"
Chris gritted his teeth, his eyes locked on Amelia with the intensity of a predator. "I don't care what the world says. I will never let go of what is mine."
"Get out!" Victor roared, sweeping a porcelain cup off the table. The sound of it shattering against the floor echoed like a gunshot.
Chris turned and stormed out, but the look he gave Amelia as he left was a promise of a hunt that was only beginning. As the door slammed shut, Leila Ross emerged from the shadows to follow him, leaving the air in the villa feeling suddenly, blessedly clear.

###Chapter 52
Amelia collapsed onto her bed, but sleep remained a distant hope. The events of the evening felt like a physical weight on her chest, each breath a struggle against the suffocating atmosphere of the Spencer mansion. She stared at her phone, her eyes tracing over photographs until her resolve hardened. She had a goal, and she wouldn't let Chris Spencer’s volatility derail her.
Suddenly, a frantic knocking shattered the silence.
"Ms. White! Please!" the maid’s voice was thin with panic.
Amelia threw open the door. "What is it?"
"Mr. Victor... it’s a heart attack. The doctors are away, and the house is empty. We need to get him to the hospital now!"
Amelia didn't hesitate. "Get him into the car. I’ll drive."
She had learned to drive under the tutelage of Shawn, a former professional racer. While she hadn't mastered his most dangerous maneuvers, her precision behind the wheel was superior to most. In less than fifteen minutes, the car screeched to a halt at the emergency entrance.
As Victor was rushed inside, Amelia called Chris. He had only just left; he couldn't be far. To her frustration, Leila Ross answered the phone.
"What do you want, Bella? It’s after midnight," Leila snapped, her tone dripping with annoyance.
"Put Chris on. It’s an emergency. If you delay this, the consequences will be on your head."
There was a pause. Leila must have recognized the cold authority in Amelia’s voice. "He’s... occupied. He had a few drinks and passed out."
"Address. Now," Amelia commanded.
The club was nearby. When Amelia burst into the private suite, she found a scene of disarray. Chris was slumped on the leather sofa, a half-empty bottle in his hand, while Leila was hovering over him with a damp cloth.
Amelia didn't waste a second. She grabbed a glass of ice water from the table and threw it directly onto Chris’s face.
"What the—! Are you insane?" Leila shrieked, jumping back.
Chris gasped, the cold shock snapping his eyes open. He wiped the water from his brow, his gaze settling on Amelia with a mixture of fury and confusion.
"Your grandfather is in the ER, and you’re here drowning your sorrows," Amelia said, her words like whipcracks. "Get up. Now."
The alcohol-induced fog in Chris’s eyes cleared instantly. "What happened?"
"A heart attack. I’ve done what I can, but you’re his next of kin. He needs you."
Chris stood up, nearly knocking Leila over in his haste. He reached for Amelia’s arm, his grip firm but no longer the aggressive yank from before. "Let’s go."
The drive back was silent and tense. In the rearview mirror, Amelia saw Chris leaning back, his eyes closed. He looked exhausted, the weight of his recent injuries and his self-destructive behavior finally catching up to him.
"I’ve already checked him in," Amelia said, her voice steady. "But I can’t sign the consent forms. You need to be sober enough to handle the paperwork."
Chris opened his eyes and stared at her profile. "You’re remarkably calm, Amelia. Or should I call you Bella? You seem more worried about him than a stranger should be."
Amelia ignored the bait, keeping her eyes on the road.
At the hospital, the wait was agonizing. Leila arrived shortly after, her face a mask of performative concern. She spotted Amelia sitting on a bench, focused intently on her phone.
"Really, Ms. White? Grandpa is in surgery, and you’re scrolling through your feed?" Leila sneered. "How heartless can you be?"
Amelia didn't look up. She was busy researching post-operative care and cardiac diets, her mind already planning Victor’s recovery.
"I’m talking to you!" Leila reached out and swiped the phone from Amelia’s hand, tossing it onto the floor. "Show some respect."
"Be quiet, Leila," Amelia said, her voice dropping to a dangerous level. "I am doing more for him in this moment than your dramatics ever will."
As Amelia reached for her phone, Chris intercepted it. He glanced at the screen, seeing the search results for 'heart stent recovery' and 'low-sodium recipes.' A complex flash of guilt and recognition crossed his face.
He handed the phone back to her, his fingers brushing hers. "She’s right, Leila. Let her be."
"Both of you are exhausting," Amelia muttered, moving to a different bench, as far away from them as possible.
When the surgeon finally emerged, he confirmed that Victor needed an immediate stent for a blocked artery. Amelia stepped forward, but the doctor looked past her. "Are you family?"
Amelia bit her lip. "I... no."
"I’m his grandson," Chris said, stepping into the light. He took the pen and signed the documents, his hand steady despite the lingering effects of the alcohol.
They stayed through the night. As dawn broke, Amelia called Lucius to update him.
"We have it under control, Lucius," Chris interrupted, leaning over and hanging up the call before Amelia could finish.
"What is wrong with you?" Amelia glared at him. "He deserves to know."
Before Chris could respond, the doors opened and Victor was wheeled out. He was pale but conscious. Amelia rushed to his side, taking his hand. Tears she had held back all night finally spilled over.
"Mr. Victor... thank God," she whispered.
Victor forced a weak smile. "Don't cry, child. I’m not going anywhere yet."
Leila pushed forward, dabbing at her dry eyes. "Grandpa, we were so worried! I’ll stay here and look after you."
Victor waved a hand dismissively. "Go home, both of you. You look like ghosts. Amelia will stay for a while."
Leila’s face twisted in a brief flash of anger, but she forced a nod. "Of course, Grandpa. Whatever you need."
As Chris and Leila turned to leave, Chris looked back at Amelia one last time. She was still holding Victor’s hand, her silhouette framed by the rising sun. For the first time, he didn't see an enemy or a ghost—he saw the woman he had spent three years ignoring, and the realization was more painful than any injury.

###Chapter 53

Victor's assistant. Justin Davis, came rushing over too.

"Big thanks to Bella this time," Victor said, leaning back against the bed with a smile. He handed the box Justin brought to Amelia. "I meant to give you this gift yesterday, but I totally forgot."

Amelia was caught off guard and took it. greatly surprised. "Thank you for your gift, Mr. Victor Spencer. I really appreciate it. You haven't fully recovered yet, and you're still thinking about me and giving me the gift."

Victor had just managed to sit up, and he still looked pretty pale.

"It's no big deal. Open it up," Victor said, struggling a bit, then started coughing hard.

Amelia quickly patted his back and poured him a glass of water, just like she had done before.


Chris watched everything from the side, his gaze getting more intense.

Amelia opened the box.

A soft glow appeared before her eyes. It was a bracelet with a deep blue gemstone.


"This bracelet is a Spencer family heirloom. My wife should've given it to you,but since she's abroad, I had to do it myself," Victor said with a kind smile.


Amelia's heart raced.

Years ago, Victor had promised that once she gave birth to Chris's child,he
would give her the family heirloom bracelet, but it never happened.

And now, after all these years, the bracelet was in her hands.

"Mr. Victor Spencer, I can't accept this. I haven't married Lucius yet; I'm not part of the Spencer family," she said, a bit anxious, avoiding Victor's all-seeing eyes.

She was scared of giving anything away.

"Exactly," Chris frowned. "Grandpa, you're rushing things."

Victor glared at him. "Mind your own business."

Then he turned to Amelia and said, "Bella, this was always meant for you.As long as you and Lucius are happy, that's all that matters. When you get married. you can wear it. No, wear it now, let me see."

Victor smiled warmly at her.

Amelia felt a warmth in her heart and finally gave in, putting on the bracelet.

The bracelet was stunning. Under the light, the gemstone shone with a captivating brilliance and dazzling colors,resting against her slender wrist.

"Thank you, Mr. Victor Spencer. I really like it," Amelia said with a genuine smile.


Victor was pleased. "See? It looks beautiful on you."

"Ms. White is really lucky. In just two days, you've made Grandpa like you so much," Leila said, her voice tinged with jealousy.


"You have something too " Victor's smile faded a bit as he looked at Justin.
Justin then took out another box. also a royal blue gift box, but smaller than Amelia's.

"This is for you. Open it." Victor nodded towards Leila.

Over the past two years. Leila had occasionally visited him, showing some signs of respect and care for him. At first, he was impatient.

But over time, even for Chris's sake, he couldn't be too cold.

And with the current situation, he couldn't let things get worse.

Leila immediately cheered, hurriedly stepped forward, took the small box,and opened it.

A pair of finely crafted gold earrings lay quietly in the box,radiating a dazzling glow.

Gold was valuable, but it got nothing on that deep blue gemstone.


Like,it's worth hundreds of times less.

Leila's eyes flashed with disappointment, but with everyone watching,she had to keep it together.

She forced a smile. "Thanks, Grandpa. I absolutely love it. I'll put it on right now."

"No rush," Victor waved his hand. "Those long earrings don't match your current hairstyle. Wait until you change it up; they'll look better then."

Leila's smile froze.

What did he mean by that?
She swallowed her feelings of disparity and unwillingness, trying to look especially cheerful in front of Victor.

But when no one else was around, she couldn't keep up the act.

Standing on the stairs, she said to Amelia, who had just come back from outside, "You must be really happy today. Grandpa gave you such a valuable gemstone bracelet, but only gave me a cheap piece of junk."

She gritted her teeth, and seeing Amelia ignoring her, she got even more furious. "What exactly do you have that makes Grandpa think so highly of you?"

Amelia had just returned from buying food and didn't want to argue with the unreasonable Leila. She needed to take care of Victor.

"Please move aside and let me pass." She glanced at Leila indifferently.

Leila's face darkened. "Bella, don't get too smug. One day, I will..."

"Then I wish you success." Amelia bypassed her and walked towards
Victor's ward.

But just then, Leila suddenly stuck out her foot,trying to trip her.

Amela rolled her eyes inwardly. This fool was as foolish as ever.

Was she trying to make her fall and break the priceless bracelet?


In that split second, Amelia understood Leila's intention. She quickly lifted her foot and stomped hard on Leila's foot.

Leila immediately let out a scream and jumped in pain. The next second,
she tumbled down the stairs, crying out even more miserably.
Her cries quickly attracted a crowd, including Chris.

He stood on the stairs, seeing Leila sprawled at the bottom, looking disheveled.and a flash of disgust crossed his eyes.

But he hid it well.

"What happened?" He quickly went down and helped Leila up with one hand.

Leila had twisted her ankle, and her elbow was scraped and bleeding.She didn't seem seriously injured, but at this moment, she felt extremely wronged.

"Chris, it hurts so much. My ankle and my arms hurt. I don't know what I did to offend Ms. White. I was just greeting her, and she cruelly pushed me down the stairs."

Her acting was quite something.

Amelia was speechless.

There were surveillance cameras in the hallway. Had she forgotten?

"Ms. White,how do you explain?" Chris's clear gaze swept over, lingering on the gemstone bracelet on Amelia's wrist, his eyes growing deeper.

Amelia instinctively hid her bracelet-wearing hand behind her and coldly said, "Believe it or not,I didn't push her."

"How can you say that? You clearly pushed me. You're simply unreasonable!" Leila cried even more pitifully,tears streaming down her face.
"You're back." Amelia's eyes lit up. "Let's go see your father."
Love Disappears Before Blindness

###Chapter 54

"Chris, I feel terrible," Leila groaned, collapsing to the ground.

Chris scooped her up and dashed to the nurse's station, looking like a comic book hero, but sadly, not Amelia's hero as his concern was entirely for someone else.

Amelia's lips twitched, a hint of bitterness on her face.

"Stay calm," Lucius whispered beside her, "Don't lose your cool."

Amelia looked up at him, surprised. Over the years, Lucius had been her mentor and friend, always there to help. She'd asked him why he was so kind, but he only gave vague answers each time. She'd tried to figure it out herself but never got the answer. Now, looking into his wise eyes,a spark of insight hit her, and she had a faint guess.

The news of Leila falling down the stairs eventually reached Victor.

"I didn't do it and I'm not going to admit it," Amelia said coldly,her voice firm.


"The cameras didn't catch the scene, so you can say whatever you want,"Chris said, his eyes dark and intense.

He was defending Leila.

"I swear," Amelía avoided his gaze as she said, her heart tightening and a chill running through her, "If I'm lying, I'll live in pain forever."

"That's enough," Victor waved her over, "I believe you. Come here."

Amelia's nosetingled, and she forced down the moroseness, sitting beside
Victor.
Lucius spoke up. "It might be a misunderstanding; Ms. Ross has misunderstood Bella before."

"That's true. Leila doesn't like Bella," Victor said in a slightly indifferent tone. "Let her rest. Chris, take care of her."

Chris left without a word, clearly unhappy with the outcome. Amelia knew this wasn't over.

When she went to the pantry for water, she ran into him.

Chris appeared suddenly, seizing her hand and pulling her to the stairwell.He then grabbed her shoulder. making a move as if to push her down the stairs.

Amelia's heart pounded, and she instinctively clung to his arm as if it were her last hope, "What the hell are you doing?"

Chris showed a vicious smile, still pressing her down slowly with only one hand.


Amelia's body tilted, and she teetered on the edge of falling down the stairs.


Was he avenging Leila?

Her eyes reddened, anger rising, "Mr. Spencer, you're truly despicable!"

Chris sneered, "Haven't you been acting all along? Why should I be a gentleman in front of you?"

This made no sense.
Amelia's face went pale, but she had to hold onto his arm tightly as if it were a lifeline.

This feeling of having her life controlled was awful. Especially by him."Well. I get the firsthand look at your vindictive and petty nature today,"Amelia sneered, thenlet go,letting herself fall.

She was betting he wouldn't let her fall.

As expected, the moment she released her hands, Chris's usually calm eyes showed shock and anger.

He instinctively reached out to grab her, but ended up getting pulled down too. In that critical moment, he held her tight, using his body to shield her.

The dizziness and impact hit her hard, and it took Amelia a while to realize she was in Chris's arms.

"Are you okay?" His tense voice came from above her head, "Did you hurt?



Amelia quaickly calmed down, then she checked herself and founad she was fine, while Chris's voice was clearly shaking.


They had fallen together, and he had protected her.

A strange feeling stirred in Amelia's heart.

But she showed an impassive expression, coldly saying, "I'm fine, Mr.Spencer. Don't joke like this next tíme."

With that, she pushed him away and stood up.

He got up too, but his left arm looked off, like it was broken.
"I like to joke," he said, seemingly unfazed by the injury, staring straight into her eyes, "This game is only fun when we play it together, don't you think?"

"Crazy," Amelia muttered under her breath and went upstairs.

That night, she heard from Victor that Chris had sprained his arm. When he went to get it set, he was sweating bullets but didn't say a word.No one knew how he got hurt.

Amelia stayed quiet, secretly thinking about how to use the next few days in the hospital to get closer to him.

She figured another "accident" might do the trick.

But she didn't expect an accident to come her way.

That noon, she brought the soup she cooked to the hospital.

As soon as she got out of the car, a familiar female voice rang out.

"Amelia, it's really you, you bitch! Since you're back, why didn't you come to see us?" It was Nina, and the moment she appeared, Amelia's heart tightened.

Nina was her biological mother, and that natural bond couldn't be erased in just a few years.


But Amelia couldn't show her panic.

She turned calmly and saw Nina and Karen rushing over.

Four years ago, these two were a wealthy lady adorned with gold and silver, and a young lady dressed in luxury brands.
Now they seemed to have fallen on-but their voices were still loud.

"You bitch, speak up! Why don't you talk? We've been looking for you like crazy these years. If Karen hadn't seen your news, we would still be looking. You bitch, you..."

"Mom, look at her, she looks rich now. Stop wasting time, ask her for money, she owes us." Karen said coldly.

Nina and Karen had been living in poverty for years,barely able to pay rent and utilities, while Amelia still looked so glamorous. They found it really unfair.

Reminded by Karen, Nina immediately realized and sneered, "Exactly, you owe us. If you hadn't insisted on divorcing Chris, our family wouldn't have fallen. Debt collectors have been breaking down our door, and we've been hiding like rats in the gutter. But you..."


"Excuse me," Amelia's aloof face showed a trace of impatience, "You've got the wrong person. I'm not Amelia. If you keep bothering me, don't blame me for calling the police."

Nina was shocked, "You want to call the police? Go ahead, I'm not afraid of you. You heartless bitch, your family is suffering, and you're putting on airs. I'm telling you, if you don't give us money today, we won't leave!"

Karen added,"Amelia, you can't be heartless. Dad is still in the hospital,don't you care about him?"
###Chapter 55

Amelia's deep eyes widened in astonishment.

No way.How could this be?

When she left. Paxton was almost fully recovered and didn't need any more treatment.

"Yeah,your dad's in the hospital, waiting for surgery. His heart's acting up again, and he needs another stent. We can't afford it, and you..."

"Hello, dispatcher, there's a robbery happening on the street." Amelia calmly pulled out her phone and called the police.

But Nina snatched the phone from her. "This is the latest model, must've cost over ten grand. Look at you, living the high life. Just a bit of your money could save us. How can you be so heartless, just watching your mother and sister suffer?"


How ironic and absurd to encounter the two people who once deeply humiliated her.


Amelia waited for Nina to finish her rant and then said, "There are cameras around the hospital entrance, in front of this store, and on that utility pole over there. I'll giveyou three seconds to leave, or I'll see you at the police station."


The scared girl she used to be was long gone. Now, she feared nothing.

"Mom, she seems different." Karen grabbed Nina's arm, trembling. "Could she really not be Amelia?"

Nina wasn't so sure anymore. She stared at Amelia, comparing her to old
photos on her phone, and realized there was a big difference.

Amelia used to be a timid, pitiful kitten.

This woman in front of them had a much stronger presence, almost like an Iron Lady.


Damn. Did they mistake her identity?

"Mom, what's wrong? Don't faint!" Karen had an idea, holding Nina and frantically winking at her.


Nina got the hint and collapsed.

Karen screamed,"Momn, someone help!"

She glanced at Amelia, who looked indifferent and even amused.

"How heartless." A deep male voice came from behind Amelia, dripping with sarcasm.


She didn't need to turn around to know who it was.

"Mr. Spencer, your arm's better?" She shot back coldly.

"Chris, you're here. Look at her, is she Amelia? She says she's not,but..."


"Cut the act." Chris waved his hand, looking pleased. "She's heartless and won't budge just because you shed a few tears."

His words were infuriating.

Amelia didn't bother to argue and turned to leave.

But her heart felt heavy, likeit was weighed down by thick, wet cotton.
"Chris, what did you mean by that? Do you think she's Amelia too?"Karen stopped her fake tears. "But why won't she admit it? What happened to her these past few years? Why has she changed into a different person?"

Chris watched Amelia's determined back, a dark shadow crossing his eyes."I have no idea."


"Don't worry, I've been keeping an eye on Mr. Tudor's situation." On the phone, Shawn reassured her softly, "Rest easy."

Amelia sighed in relief, "Thanks, Shawn. I couldn't have made it without you these past few years."

After hanging up, Amelia sat in the garden for a bit, trying to get her emotions in check before heading to Victor's hospital room.

She was grateful to have a friend like Shawn, who always had her back.

She needed to stay focused and reach her goal as soon as possible.

Time flew by, and three days passed.


Shawn brought news that Paxton did have some health issues and needed a stent, but it wasn't serious. He had already covered the medical bills, and the surgery could be arranged in a couple of days.

Amelia tried to transfer a hundred thousand dollars, but Shawn refused it.

"We are good friends and I would like to show my care for your father,"Shawn explained.

Two days later, Paxton had the surgery. Karen and Nina stayed at the hospital, while Shawn was kept outside, and no one could get close to
gather information.

That night, the hospital reported bad news: Paxton's surgery had triggered other acute conditions, and he was in critical condition.

Hearing this, Amelia panicked and rushed to the hospital.

She couldn't go against her nature anymore when it came to her father.


After years of not seeing him, their reunion was under such circumstances.Amelia's heart ached, and tears welled up uncontrollably. She wiped them away and stepped on the gas.

Suddenly,the phone rang urgently!

She held the steering wheel with one hand and reached out to turn it off.only to see the caller was Lucius.

"Your father is fine." Lucius's voice was particularly calm on the phone."Someone deliberately misled you, trying to expose your identity."

Amelia's mind went blank.

Lucius continued, "Trust me."

Amelia cried, overwhelmed by the immense relief.

"Thank you, Mr. Howard, As long as my dad is okay, that's allthat matters." She had been terrified, her mind filled with memories of her time with Paxton. And that stormy night four years ago, when Paxton cried and begged her to ask Chris not to divorce her.

Her father was always her weakness.

"Amelia, I don't want to see you lose control like this again." Lucius
paused before speaking again.

Amelia shivered. She took a deep breath, "Got it."

Twenty minutes later, she parked in a temporary spot outside the hospital and walked in alone.


The moment she appeared, she was spotted.

"Amelia, you said you're not Amelia? You bitch, I finally caught you!"Nina ran out of the stairwell like a madwoman, grabbing Amelia's arm."Don't you admit it? You..."


"Release me." Amelia coldly shook her off, looking at her with disgust,and brushed off nonexistent dust from her clothes. "Show some respect."


"Respect? Amelia, don't forget who gave birth to you and raised you. After all these years, you're still shameless, not even admitting yourown mother!" Karen gritted her teeth, full of hate.


"Stop pretending. If you are not Amelia, why did you come here to visit your dad?" Nina looked smug, as if her trick had worked.


Amelia showed a puzzled expression,"Who?"

"Your dad,Paxton Tudor. You're still pretending?"

"I've got my own business and don't have time to argue with you." Amelia calmly walked past them towards the outpatient building.

Nina was totally stunned, her mouth hanging open but no words coming out.
###Chapter 56

Karen quickly started bawling, "Mom, what are we gonna do now that Dad s like this? He's the head of the famnily, and if something happens to him,we're..."


"God, this is so unfair! A heartless daughter living her life well,not even caring about her own father, and now he's about to die!" Nina wailed loudly, drawing a lot of curious stares.


"What's going on? A daughter not caring about her own dad?"

"Why does she look so familiar, like some celebrity?"

"Quick, take a picture, it's entertainment news."

In no time, cameras were pointed at the three women.

Amelia stayed particularly clinical, lifted her sunglasses, and kept walking away like she didn't have a care in the world.


"Follow her!" Nina's face changed instantly, "She must be going to see your dad."


Karen gritted her teeth and nodded, "Yeah, we were too hasty. We should've exposed her disguise right at Dad's hospital room."

They trailed Amelia from about a dozen steps back.

They watched as she went to the second-floor medical office and entered the neurology clinic.

What was going on?

This idiot couldn't even tell where the inpatient department was, or where the cardiovascular department was?

"What are you doing here? Your dad's in the inpatient department. If you don't go now, you won't even see him one last time!" Nina followed Amelia into the clinic, coldly questioning her.


"Dr. Nguyen, please call security to get these two women out of here."Amelia's face showed her impatience, "They've been following me and spouting all sorts of nonsense."


"Security, take them straight to the psychiatric department." Gabriel Nguyen waved his hand, and the security at the door immediately came in,holding electric batons, and started driving Nina and her daughter away.

Nina was shocked, "You ungrateful daughter, is this how you treat your own mother and sister? You're simply insane!"


"Who's insane?" Amelia shot back apathetically, her whole body radiating an icy aura, "If you two keep bothering me, don't blame me for being rude!"


Nina was so scared she froze, unable to say a word.

Was this still the timid and fearful Amelia from before? How did she become so strong and cold?

Could it be that they really mistook her for someone else?

"Mom, Amelia has a mole on her waist and another on her arm,remember?" Karen quickly reminded her.
But by this time, security was already pushing them out.

Nina urgently said, "You say you're not my daughter, dare you let me check?"

Amelia crossed her arms and sneered,"Check what?"

"You don't need to know. Just ask if you dare?" Nina smiled sinisterly,with a look of absolute confidence.


Amelia calmly countered, "What if after the check, there's nothing unusual?



Nina didn't even think before speaking, "Impossible. But if there really is nothing. we'll just leave." She wouldn't lose anything either way.

But it wasn't that simple.

"If you can't find what you're looking for, you both have to apologize to me and never show up in front of me again." Amelia's eyes turned cold,exuding an undeniable aura.


Nina stiffened,looking at Karen.

The two exchanged a glance, and Karen signaled that she couald agree.

Anyway, it was not a big deal.

"Fine." Nina snorted, "Whatever."

"I want you to swear," Amelia pressed on, "If you can't do it,may you be poor forever."


"You vicious bitch!" Nina's face turned pale with anger, "I refuse to swear."

"Then sorry, security, please..." Amelia was interrupted by Karen before she could finish.

"Okay. Mom. we can do it." Karen quickly grabbed Nina's arm,signaling her continuously.

Nina hesitated,clearly unwilling, but had no choice.

"Fine, if there's nothing we're looking for, we'll never come to you again.Otherwise, may we be poor forever, okay?" With that, she couldn't wait to step forward and lift Amelia's coat sleeve.

A delicate arm, smooth and flawless, with no mole at all.

Nina's breath hitched. Karen stepped forward, "Mom, maybe it's the other arm?"


The two checked Amelia's other arm.

Amelia was getting impatient, "What exactly are you looking for?"

Both her arms were clean, with nothing on them. Even the fine hair was barely visible unless you looked closely.

"The waist, check the waist," Nina gritted her teeth.


Amelia took off her coat herself, lifted her shirt, revealing a delicate waist.

She used to be very thin, the kind of thin that looked unhealthy, but after years of conditioning and exercise, her body was now well-proportioned and strong, her slender waist exuding a unique feminine beauty and allure.

And her waist was even smoother than her arms.

Nina looked carefully all around but found no mole.
"Impossible, this is impossible!" She gritted her teeth, stepping back, "You must have had the mole removed, I don't believe you."

"Believe it or not." Amelia glared at her coldly, quickly putting on her clothes, "Remember what you said."

Meanwhile,outside the hospital.

Chris sat quietly in a black Porsche, watching the live feed on his phone.

When Amelia lifted her shirt,his eyes narrowed.

She had a slender waist and gave him a very familiar feeling.

He also remembered that Amelia used to have a mole on her waist, though it wasn't very noticeable, but now it was clearly gone.


"She is really ruthless to herself." He chuckled, turning off the screen.

When Nina and Karen proposed this test, he knew that Amelia wouldn't fall for it.


How could a ruthless Amelia who shattered her past and flushed it down the drain overlook such small details?


But what exactly was she planning?

He opened the car door and went directly to the medical office where Amelia was.


"Dr. Nguyen, my boyfriend has been having trouble sleeping lately, do you have any remedies for him?" Amelia's voice was calm, unaffected by the recent friction.


Gabriel asked a few more questions, which she answered one by one, then
she took the prescription and went to get the medicine.

As soon as she stepped out, a tall figure blocked her, pulling her away.

"Chris, what are you doing?" Amelia was shocked, struggling hard,but it was futile.

Chris was incredibly strong, his grip on her like a vice. He remained silent,resembling a terrifying demon.

"Let go of me!" Amelia anticipated something, "We are in the hospital."

"Stop pretending." Chris suddenly smiled, a malicious curve on his lips,"I know you want to see him."


Amelia was startled, but had no time to speak, as he forcibly took her to the inpatient building, to Paxton's room.
###Chapter 57

Paxton had just had heart stent surgery and looked pretty weak, but the second he saw Amelia outside the door, a spark of excitement lit up his tired eyes.


"Amelia, is that you? Really?" Paxton was thrilled and tried to get out of bed.


Amelia's face tightened, and she almost teared up. "Mr. Spencer, what do you mean? I've told you a million times, I'm not Amelia!"

Her voice was loud enough for the family of three in the room to hear clearly.


Paxton's face went stiff, and he looked at Karen,surprised.

Karen snorted. "I don't get what Amelia's thinking. Now that she's made it,she doesn't want to acknowledge us poor folks anymore? It's one thing to ignore me and Mom, but not even Dad? She really has no heart."

Nina chimed in with a hint of sarcasm, "Paxton, take a good look at this famous painter. Is she your daughter? Karen and I have tried everything,but she just won't acknowledge us. As her mother, it breaks my heart."

"Mom, why don't we leaveand let Amelia have some time alone with Dad?" Karen pulled Nina towards the door.

"Amelia, what's going on? How did you become like this? But you look better now. My daughter has become better. Karen said you became a painter, right? You always loved painting when you were little.But why didn't you come back to find us when you survived the accident? Where have you been all these years?"
Paxton's voice was hoarse, filled with a deep sadness.

Amelia stood there,tense, not knowing what to do for several seconds.


Her mind was a mess.

This was her father, the only one in the family who was good to her, the father who would beg and kneel to others for her happiness.

Chris sure knew how to hit her where it hrt.

"Sir, I don't understand what you're talking about." Amelia paused,took a deep breath, and said, "Many people say I look like Amelia, but as far as I know, she is already dead. And I feel sorry for her, but it really bothers me to be mistaken for her so often. I hope you won't mistake me for her again in the future."


After saying that,she walked away. Though her heart ached badly, she had no choice.


She had more important things to do now.

"Mr. Spencer, I've tolerated your rudeness several times, but today you are way out of line." Outside the door, Amelia glared coldly at Chris, her eyes full of displeasure.


Chris casually put one hand in his pocket andI looked at her nonchalantly, "You are so cruel, ignoring even your own father? What exactly are you trying to do?"


"What does it have to do with you?" Amelia sneered.

"Just so happens I'm in a good mood today, let me take yo somewhere."

"Why should I follow you?" Amelia walked towards her car.
Chris's cool voice sounded behind her. "Because I'm your big client."

Before he finished speaking, Amelia stopped in her tracks and sighed.

The two of them arrived at the Spencer family cemetery.

Amelia followed him silently, walking towards a tombstone with a black and white photo but no identity inscription.


Was this her tombstone?

How merciless Chris was! Even after she died, he didn't give her an identity.


An unmarked tombstone, how ridiculous.

"Your ex-wife was miserable." Amelia sneered, "During life,you mistreated her in every possible way, and now in death, there's not even an epitaph."

Chris stared at the photo on the tombstone for what fel like forever before he finally spoke. "She didn't die. Everyone said she drowned in the river,but I didn't buy it. I almost drained that river,searched for months,and ended up with severe insomnia because of it..."

"What are you trying to say?" Amelia cut him off, glancing at her watch. "I m not interested in Mr. Spencer's past."

Chris turned his head and looked at her quietly.

The breeze lifted the strands of hair on Amelia's forehead, giving her an indescribable distant and noble aura. Her whole vibe had changed a lot,like she was a different person.

He wondered,could four years erase all traces of a person's past?

Was it possible?

But the fact was right in front of him.

Chris suddenly turned and walked towards the cemetery gate.

Amelia was a bit puzzled but knew he would definitely return,so she waited in place.


Looking at the unmarked tombstone in front of her, she felt a sense of desolation.


Forget it, her past was buried with this tombstone.

As long as she ddn't admit it, no one could uncover it.


As she expected, Chris soon returned. But he was holding an iron hammer.

Amelia realized what he was going to do and was immediately shocked,"
What are you doing?"

"It shouldn't exist." Chris said nothing more, raising the hammer and smashing it onto the tombstone.


Amelia's heart trembled violently, and she instinctively stood in front of the tombstone, spreading her arms, "No, don't!"

A trace of doubt flashed in Chrs's deep eyes, "Move aside."

"You're truly insane," Amelia hissed through gritted teeth. "Aren't you afraid your ex-wife will haunt you in a visitation dream?"

"I never see her in my dreams." Chris smiled bitterly, "You don't understand."
Amelia's gaze was complicated, "Mr. Spencer, sometimes I genuinely don't understand what you're thinking. Do you love her or hate her?"

If it was love, why hurt her so much?

If it was hate, why remember her deeply?

Chris suddenly stiffened, and his whole body visibly tensed up.

As night gradually fell, everything between the sky and the earth became the backdrop for his cold figure.

He was silent for a long time before speaking heavily, "I don't know."

As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly staggered back a few steps.

Amelia was startled and quickly supported him as he was about to collapse, only to find that he was burning up with fever.

She took him back home.

After all, it was very close to her home, and this was also an opportunity for her.


"Lie down first, I should have left some fever medicine here." She settled him on the sofa and was about to leave when he grabbed her arm, "Amelia,it's you, I know it's you."


At this moment, her gentle and caring demeanor was exacrly the same as a few years ago.

"Yes, I am Amelia, You rest first, I..." Before she could finish, a strong force pulled her into his arms.

The fresh scent of him enveloped her, and Amelia panicked,struggling a
bit, only to be pinned down by him.

"Amelia, I know it's you. Your scent hasn't changed." He kissed her eagerly, as if using all his strength.

This scene had played out in her mind countless times.

To achieve her goal, she had to go through this process.


But when she actually had intimate contact with him, she realized that her body didn't reject him as much as she had imagined.


Did she still love him?

In a moment of distraction, her shirt was already torn open, and her chest felt a chill. She quickly pushed him away and snapped, "Are you crazy?"
###Chapter 58

He tensed up. and in his weakened state, the hostility in him had faded a lot, making him way more mellow than usual.

He glanced up. looking all confused. like he couldn't figure out who was in front of him.


"You,Amelia.n."

"T'm your future aunt," Amelia said with a smirk, but her words cut deep.

Chris got pissed off right away and grabbed her shoulder, "Aunt? Not a chance without my say-so!"


Amelia then called Leila.

Since this drama was already rolling, why not crank it up a notch?

Leila showed up in less than twenty minutes, still in a fancy evening gown.clearly having rushed over from some swanky party.

"Chris, what's wrong with you, what's going on?" Seeing Chris slumped on the sofa, Leila's face went pale, "Bella, what did you do?"

"You should be thankful I haven't done anything to him," Amelia said provocatively, "Otherwise, you wouldn't be here."

Leila gritted her teeth, "You're shameless. Bringing my boyfriend back in the middle of the night, aren't you scared Lucius will find out?"

"I've got nothing to hide, so what's there to fear?" Amelia sneered,"Take him away now."

The two left in a hurry.
In the big suite, only Amelia was left. She drew the curtains and finally let herself show a vulnerable and helpless expression.

Staring at the photo on the screen, she couldn't help but wonder if she had just missed a great opportunity.

But if she didn't push him away while he was still conscious, with his cunning,he would surely suspect her true intentions.

She had to be patient and make him lose his cool first, then she could move forward with her plan.

Three days later. Victor was discharged from the hospital.

Amelia went back to the studio, keeping up her persona, quietly painting and selling her artwork.


She was planning their next meeting but found no peace, as troubles kept coming.


That afternoon, a piece of news disrupted her peaceful life.

"It's really unfair. We painstakingly raised a beautiful daughter,only for her to grow up and become an ungrateful wretch who doesn't recognize her own parents. It's so heartbreaking."

Watching the short video edited from the live broadcast of Nina crying.Amelia's face turned icy.

Sable also looked helpless, "She started a lve broadcast last night.Although it was quickly shut down, those clips were still edited and widely shared, spreading all over the internet."

Amelia took a deep breath, "Don't panic, there's nothing to be afraid of."

She leaned back on the sofa. closed her eyes, and thought about what to do next.

Sable was a bit uneasy. "What if those people dig up your past?"

"They won't" Amelia said without hesitation, "Mr. Howard won't let that happen."

After work. Amelia went to the garage to get her car.

As her hand touched the car door handle, a strange feeling washed over her,and she subconsciously sensed danger.


Before she could react, a dark figure flashed by, and a knife was aimed at her heart.


Amelia's hair stood on end, and she instinctively grabbed the person's hand.seeing the vicious face clearly.

Ace! After four years, he was still alive.

"Bitch!" Ace missed his first strike and swung the knife again. Amelia couldn't block it, and her arm got stabbed, blood pouring out instantly.

The sharp pain brought back the feeling of being on death's doorstep.

"Are you insane?" Amelia gritted her teeth and growled, "This is a crime!"


Ace was seething with rage, "Even if it's a crime, I'm gonna kill you, bitch!"

"I'm Bella White!" Amelia was shocked and scrambled to dodge.

She kept praying someone would show up to help her. This lunatic seemed hell-bent on killing her.
At that moment. her phone rang.

She answered it while running,not caring who it was, and urgently shouted into the phone, "Help me. I'm in the studio garage."

"Bitch, you dare call for help!" Ace chased after her like a madman.stabbing her twice in the back. Amelia felt unbearable pain and tripped over a parking barrier, falling to the ground.

Ace sneered and didn't rush to attack, instead kicking her legs like a cat playing with a mouse, "Bitch, run? Why aren't you running?"

Ace seemed to have had a rough few years, completely changed,full of hostility, no longer resembling a wealthy young man.


"How dare you! I am Lucius's girlfriend!" Amelia endured the pain and shouted angrily.


Ace laughed, "Do you think I believe that? If it weren't for you, bitch,would I be in this situation? Even if I die today, I'll take you with me!"


"No!" Amelia was terrified, her fear growing, almost releasing her former timid self.


She gritted her teeth, constantly reminding herself not to be afraid, not to be weak!


"If you kill me, Lucius will never let you go!" She said, "Just do it if you don't believe me!"


Ace was stunned for a moment. As his rationality returned, he remembered that he only wanted revenge; he didn't actually want to kill her or get into legal trouble.
Suddenly,a car horn blared.

The high beams flashed. and Ace was startled to see the car coming straight at him.

His heart jolted immediately, and he hastily pulled Amelia up, pressing the dagger against her neck for self-protection.


Amelia was covered in blood, her face pale.

At this moment, the person in the car got out. It was Chris!


Amelia couldn't describe her feelings, but her heart,which had been in her throat,relaxed significantly.

His presence gave her a strong sense of security, which was inexplicable.

"Chris!" Ace was filled with malice, gritting his teeth and glaring at him, "It s you again!"


It was Chris who had been sending people to hunt him down all these years,forcing him from a privileged young man to a despised outcast.

"You court death." Chris's gaze swept over Amelia's pale face, his expression turning cold.


Time seemed to rewind to four years ago,everything happening again.

He couldn't save her last time; how could he let himself fail again?


"Let her go, and I will spare your life today," Chris's voice was frigid,like Satan.


Ace trembled, the deepest fear almost making him wet his pants.
But he knew even if he let her go, he would die too.

"Step back, or I'll slit her throat!" Ace threatened.
###Chapter 59

Following his words. Chris took a couple of steps back, but his eyes were still icy cold.

Amelia was barely hhanging on. The heat from her body was fading fast,and the cold was creeping into her heart and lungs.

"Help." she whispered,looking at Chris.

Their eyes met, and she saw the rage in his eyes.


"Yeah, that's it." Ace sneered. He was losing it, the thriIl of making a strong opponent submit was too much, something he had never felt before.


"Keep begging for help. I want to see how much he can take," he laughed so hard his whole body shook. But then, Amelia collapsed.

She had lost too much blood and couldn't stand anymore.

Ace was terrified, staring at Amelia on the ground. His face went pale,and his mind went blank, with only one thought: Run, run now!

But the next second, Chris punched him, sending him flying.

The pain hit him hard, and he fell, half of his face numb, teeth flying out.

His head was buzzing, and before he could recover, a sharp pain pierced his shoulder.


"Go to hell!" Chris raised the knife, and the dagger that had hurt Amelia was now deep in Ace's shoulder, piercing straight through.

Then, he quickly got up, took off his coat, tore a few strips of cloth,and wrapped them around Amelia's bleeding arm.
Only then did he notice the wounds on her back.

"Amelia, wake up!" His voice trembled. and his heart was filled with fear.

Her injuries were too severe, he didn't dare to move her himself and immediately called for an ambulance. În the meantime,he held her.pressing on her wound.

'Amelia, you have to be okay.' His usually strong heart was now trembling like a leaf in the wind.


"Sir, please let go of her!" After a while, someone shouted, asking him to release his hold.


Chris finally came to his senses and said, "Her arm and back were stabbed with a dagger about seven inches long, she lost consciousness due to severe blood loss, she needs a blood transfusion immediately."


The nurse quickly lifted Amelia onto the stretcher, and Chris followed.watching as Amelia was hooked up to an oxygen tank. Only then did he realize his legs were weak.

He kept thinking, why didn't he get there sooner? If he had arrived just a few minutes earlier, she wouldn't have been hurt so badly.

At the hospital, he was the only one waiting outside Amelia's operating room.


It took two hours before she was pushed out of the emergency room. By then, her complexion had improved a bit, but she stillhadn't woken up.

Chris stayed by her bedside, staying awake all night.

The next morning, Lucius and the others arrived.
"What happened, how did she get so seriously injured?" Victor took one look at Amelia's pale face and broke down, his voice choked with sobs.

Lucius's face was even grimmer. "Why didn't you tell me immediately when she got hurt?" He questioned.

Chris sat there quietly, motionless, as if he was the only one left in the world.


"Speak." Lucius, used to be calm and composed, now showed his true emotions, angrily grabbing Chris by the collar, his voice icy, "What happened?"

He hadn't had time to dig into it yet.

"Why should I explain to you?" Chris's face was a blank slate.

"She's my girlfriend." Lucius gritted his teeth, "Chris, you crossed the line!"

"Oh really? Then where were you when she was almost stabbed to death?I know your game, you want to use her to get to me, dream on." Chris shot a cold glareat Lucius, his whole body radiating hostility.

"You..."

"Stop, Bella's awake," Victor scolded in a low voice.

Amelia was indeed awake, but she had no strength left. Just opening her eyes had drained her.


"Bella, how do you feel? Should I get the doctor?" Victor asked gently.

Amelia managed a weak smile, wanting to say she was fine, but her throat was parched.

The words she wanted to say turned into a single word, "Water."

"Water, did you hear that? Get some water!" Victor ordered urgently.

Chris suddenly stood up. but Victor pushed him back down,giving him a silent glare.

Lucius quickly brought a cup of water, but Amelia couldn't move, so he used a small spoon to feed her bit by bit.

A look of gratitude and guilt flashedin Amelia's eyes.

It was all because she had let her guard down.

"It's okay, just rest and you'll get better soon," Lucius smiled.

For someone who rarely smiled, his smile was actually quite warm.


The two of them didn't say much, nor did they make any extra movements,
but there was an invisible bond, filled with gentle affection.

Chris watched this scene, feeling both irritated and angry. The negative emotions pressed down on him, almost driving him mad.

"Chris, you should go rest," Victor said, "Look at you, you're completely worn out."


Chris stood up,glanced at the half-dead Amelia on the bed, and snorted."I saved her, and I get no thanks?"

Amelia struggled to turn her head to look at him, "Thank you,Mr. Chris Spencer."


She was so badly injured that even saying a few words made her break out in a cold sweat.
"Alright, don't talk anymore," Lucius said, holding her hand tenderly, then turned to Chris. "Chris. I apologize for my earlier attitude, you saved Bella.I should thank you."

"Save it." Chris sneered, "T've never seen someone thank another on behalf of the person who was saved, I don't need it."

He then looked coldly at Amelia, "Remember,you owe me your life."


Four years ago, he had said the same thing.

Amelia's heart tightened, and a heavy emotion spread through her heart.

The news of her incident quickly spread, almost overshadowing the false statements Nina had been spreading.


Now,many people were linking her mysterious background to this violent incident, making all sorts of speculations and posting them online.

In no time. Amelia's Instagram gained tens of thousands of followers.

"Stop looking at your phone," Lucius came over and took her phone away,"I'll handle those things for you, your job now is to recover, don't think about anything else."


It had been three days,and Amelia could barely sit up, but her body was still weak, she couldn't get out of bed, nor was she allowed to.

"Where's Ace?"She asked.

Lucius's eyes darkened, "He's in jail, and he'll be sentenced."
###Chapter 60

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to push away the scary memories in her head.


"That's good," she whispered.

She was super bored in the hospital, so by the third day, when she could finally get out of bed, she asked someone to bring her painting supplies and started painting in her room.

That afternoon, an unexpected visitor showed up.

Amelia had gone to the bathroom to wash her brushes. When she came back, she saw a very familiar figure standing outside the slightly open door.

It was Paxton, her dad, the only person who truly cared about her.

Amelia froze, her nose tingling with emotion, and for a moment, she didn't know what to do. Would he want to acknowledge her?

But Paxton just stood there quietly with no intention to come inside,his eyes full of love.


Amelia got it. Maybe he knew it wasn't the right time for her to acknowledge him.


She took a deep breath and calmly went back to her painting, moving the canvas a bit closer to the door so he could see more.

The silent understanding between father and daughter was at its peak.They didn't say a word, just stayed together for over ten minutes until an untimely voice broke the silence.
"Mr. Tudor, why don't you go in?" It was Chris.


That damn guy was here again.

Amelia pretended she had just noticed and looked towards the door.


Paxton turned away to avoid her gaze.

Outside the door, he waved at Chris and lowered his voice, "Don't disturb Ms. White, I'm leaving now."


"Mr. Tudor," Chris grabbed his arm, "Did you see clearly who she really is?



Paxton's eyes paused, a trace of sadness flashed in his eyes, and he sighed,"I once hoped that Amelia hadn't died, but Mr. Spencer, anyone with eyes can see this Ms. White is way better than Amelia. Amelia has been dead for four years, and we should accept it."

His voice was hoarse, and his whole body exuded a sense of sorrow.

Chris had no reason to stop him, watching him leave, his steps faltering.

"Is he Mr. Spencer's ex-wife's father?" Amelia finally came out,leaning against the wall, "Have you taken care of him? With your capabilities,making sure he lives well is just a matter of words."

Chris thought for a moment, then looked up at her, "You're testing me."

"Think whatever you want," she turned and went back into the room, the wound on her back seemed to have opened up, and the bloodstains were particularly noticeable.

Chris saw this and his breath caught, instinctively becoming nervous,and couldn't help but shout, "Stop!"
Amelia was puzzled and turned to look at him. "What, Mr. Spencer,are you going to have a debate with me,who is injured?"

"Your wound has opened up, sit down immediately, don't move," he helped her to the sofa, "let the nurse change your dressing."

He seemed deeply worried about her.

"No need," Amelia stopped him, "the nurse just changed the dressing around half an hour ago, I might have accidentally pulled it, it's not a big deal."


Chris stopped, turned his head, "So, you'd rather not trouble others and endure the pain yourself, are you insane?"

Amelia rolled her eyes. His words were extremely harsh.

After a while, the nurse came in, saw the blood on her back, and hurriedly said, "Ms. White, let me change your dressing again."

Amelia didn't refuse. She sat there, back to the nurse, lifting her shirt,revealing her slender waist.

Her waist had been deliberately trained, thinner than before but well-proportioned, with tight skin and more strength.

She suddenly felt a burning gaze on her and realized Chris was still there.

"Mr. Spencer, please leave," she said sternly.

Chris's eyes darkened as he looked at her waist for a moment, but unusually, he didn't argue and silently walked out.

And the scene just now lingered in his mind.
He had been with Amelia before, touching every inch of her skin,including her waist.

Back then, she was delicate and soft, her slender waist seemingly boneless,particularly smooth.

But just now, he could see a noticeable change.

Her waist was thinner, more attractive, and more vibrant. He couldn't help but have wild thoughts.

After the nurse finished changing the dressing, he walked back in.

Suddenly,he noticed the wallpaper on Amelia's phone when it lit up with the sound of an incoming message. Then Chris grew suspicious when
Amelia quickly turned her head towards him upon seeing his eyes focused on her wallpaper.


Chris was faster than her, quickly grabbing her phone and looking at the photo closely before the screen went dark.

Amelia with two children, a boy and a girl, smiling happily.

Those two kids...


"Why did you snatch my phone?" Amnelia walked over, frowning, "Give it back to me."


"Who are the the kids in the photo?" Chris questioned.

Amelia's expression didn't change, "They are my friend's children, Boy-Girl Twins. I have a good relationship with them. They are five years old.I think they are cute, so I use the photo as my wallpaper. Is that not allowed?"
Damn,how did she forget to change it back?

Chris looked at her suspiciously. "Ms. White, don't lie."

His presence was particularly intimidating, making people instinctively fearful.

While Amelia smiled faintly, "Why would I lie? What do you have that's worth lying about?"

Chris was silent for a moment, then left.

Amelia's heart, which had been hanging, finally relaxed.

She picked up her phone, looking at the children on the screen, her heart instantly softening.

That night, Lucius came over.

"Your father publicly clarified for you, look at this video," he handed her the phone, the screen playing a video.

"I am Amelia's father. My daughter died in a car accident four years ago.I do not know this Ms. White. Please treat this matter rationally and do not harm innocent people..."

The video was only a few seconds long. In the video, Paxton wore dark clothes, facing the camera, exuding a solemn aura that made people believe him.


Amelia stared at the video of Paxton for a long time, her eyes turning wet.

"He's afraid I'll be attacked," she choked up slightly, "Mr.Howard,did he recognize me?"
Lucius pursed his lips, holding her hand, "Perhaps."

Amelia stiffened, instinctively pulling her hand back.

They had never done such an intimate gesture when alone.

Did he forget that this was a hospital room, and there was no one else here?


"Sorry," a trace of darkness flashed in Lucius's eyes, "I forgot."


Her instinctive reaction had already exposed her inner thoughts. Perhaps he was too hasty.


"How are Owen and Olivia these days? Have they been asking for their mom?" Lucius paused, then suddenly asked.


Amelia was stunned for a moment, got up to close the door, and then said."I haven't contacted them for several days. They might have forgotten about me."


"Impossible." Lucius smiled, "Why don't you video call them now,let me see them too."
###Chapter 61

Amelia didn't say no.

Over the past few years, if it wasn't for Lucius, she wouldn't have been able to keep these two kids safe.Those were her kids, a boy-girl twin duo.The older one was Owen Tudor, and the younger one was Olivia Tudor.

They were the bright spots in her otherwise dark life, sticking with her through the roughest times.

Amelia quickly dialed up the nanny, DDora Hill.

The video call connected, and Olivia's little face popped up on the screen.She yelled. "Owen, hurry up, it's Mommy!"

In no time, a little guy about four years old showed up in the video. He had this composed look on his face, but even though he was small,he had a certain presence.

"Slow down," he said, worried, "Dora said you can't..."

"Stop talking and come see Mommy and Mr. Howard," Olivia said,pulling Owen over with her tiny hands. "Mommy, Mr. Howard, hi! Long time no see! I missed you so much, did you miss me?"

Olivia's sweet little voice melted Amelia's heart through the screen.

"Of course, I missed you the most, Olivia. Give me a kiss." Amelia brought the phone closer and kissed the screen.

Right then, she was her true self, happy like a kid.

Lucius watched her, his smile growing as he saw her so happy.
"Owen, say hi to Mommy," Olivia told Owen.

Owen,still looking calm, glanced at Olivia, a bit helpless. "I've been looking at Mommy."

Amelia laughed, "Owen, can you give me a smile? Mr. Howard and I both want to see you smile."

Owen struggled, and after a while, he managed a small smile that quickly faded from his little face.

"Mommy doesn't call often, and you don't smile. I don't like you anymore!"Olivia pouted,crossing her arms and glaring at Owen.

Amelia covered her mouth, laughing, and glanced at Lucius, who had a gentle look on his face.


Owen panicked and said to Olivia, "Hey, you know Mommy doesn't call often. Don't be mad. I won't be like that anymore."

Olivia immediately smiled.

The two kids were so different, one collected and the other lively. Amelia often wondered if genes were that powerful because Owen was like a mini Chris.


When hanging up, Amelia were loath to say goodbye to her lovely kids,but her mood was much better.

"They're really cute," Lucius said thoughtfully.

Amelia didn't quite get what he meant and replied, "Yeah, but they're not easy to handle. Mr. Howard, don't you remember? When they were little,they were a handful. You even sent someone to help mne take care of them,
and the babysitter had a tough time!"

Lucius looked at her softly but didn't say anything.

Amelia felt a bit awkward and changed the subject.

Recovering in the hospital was boring, so Amelia started a live stream on a small platform,painting.

She had tens of thousands of followers on this platform, so as soon as she went live. people started sending her virtual gifts.

Meanwhile, at a club in Pinecrest.

"What are you guys watching?" Nolan asked, seeing a few friends huddled in a corner, focusing on their phone screens.

"A streamer is live painting. It's pretty cool," one of his friends said casually.


Nolan grabbed his phone and leaned back on the sofa, a few people gathering around him.

On the screen, there was just a painting frame, a slender back,and a window with a nice view in the background.


Even though she was streaming, she hadn't said a word. The only sounds were her brush strokes and the occasional gift notification.

"What's so interesting about this?" Nolan handed the phone to Chris."
That back looks familiar, and that waist is so thin. If I could touch it, that'd be great."

Chris leaned back on the sofa, took the phone, and glanced at the screen.seeing the hands sketching seriously.
Suddenly, his face darkened, and he sat up straight.

The others, thinking Chris was interested, all pulled out their phones and sent a bunch of gifts to the streamer, filling the screen with special effects.

Amelia noticed and smiled gently, her soft voice coming through the phone.
"Thank you all."

Her voice seemed altered, but it was clear she was a gentle woman.


"She's got that kind of charm. Not bad, good at painting,sweet voice,she must be beautiful too," someone laughed.


They didn't notice Chris's face growing darker.

"Turn it off," he ordered coldly.

Everyone in the room was startled, looking at each other, but no one dared to disobey.


Leila, seeing this, walked over and sat next to him, "What's wrong,Chris?Something bothering you?"

She also noticed something was off. The live stream looked like it was in a hospital, and the back looked exactly like Amelia, or rather, Bella. No wonder Chris was angry.

"Nothing," Chris said indifferently.

Leila poured him a cup of ginger tea, "Drink some of this; it'll help settle your stomach."


Chris got up and walked out.

This time, Leila saw him off to the car but didn't go with him. Instead, she
got into her own car.

Leila opened the live stream and found it was indeed Amelia. That hairstyle, that dressing style, who else could if be?

"Go to the Spencer family hospital," Leila ordered through gritted teeth.

When Leila arrived, Amelia had already finished the live stream, and a nurse was changing her dressing.


"What an unfortunate coincidence, I arrived late and missed seeing how our Ms. White was live-streaming her flirting with men." Leila strutted in on four-inch heels, her eyes flashing with mockery.

Amelia asked the nurse to leave and then said, "Well, Ms. Ross wants to learn? But you already have Mr. Spencer, it wouldn't be appropriate to hook up with others."


"You bitch, do you even know what decency is? You already have Mr.Howard, and you're still seducing Chris. Do you forget that we're already engaged?"


Leila had been holding back for days. Chris often came to the hospital,sometimes going in and out, but more often, he just parked outside and sat there silently, no one knew what he was thinking.

His behavior was extremely weird, and it was all because of this bitch.

"Ms. Ross, that's strange. You failed to handle your boyfriend and now you are blaming me?" Amelia poured herself a glass of water, took a sip,found it too hot, and put it down.

"You bitch."
"I recorded it." Amelia shook her phone and casually threw it on the coffee table, "You're a public figure, don't be so excessive, or you'll embarrass yourself."
###Chapter 62

Leila's face turned beet red with anger as she stepped forward, "You're really lucky to be alive, aren't you? That person stabbed you so many times,why didn't they finish the job?"

Amelia ignored her and uploaded the recording to her social media without naming names.


Leila didn't notice it and kept going with another nasty remark, "That day,were you trying to use your injury to make Chris pity you? But he didn't care at all and left you in the hospital. Let me tell you, not all men are like that..."


Before she could finish, her agent, Nora Evans,called.

Leila, annoyed, hung up, but Nora kept calling, clearly something urgent.

Leila finally answered, snapping in front of Amelia, "What is it? Spit it out.



Nora, holding back her anger, said urgently, "Leila, what have you done? I know you hate her, but it is wrong to curse her with mean words like wishing her dead!"


Leila was stunned, "When did I curse..."

Halfway through,she remembered Amelia.

She saw Amelia looking at her with a mocking smile.

"How dare you!" She was furious.

Ever since she got with Chris, with his strong backing, she had been a
bully in the entertainment industry, and no one dared to defy her. Even if she messed up. others would tolerate her for Chris's sake.

But today, her actions were exposed online, and netizens weren't that forgiving.

"Get PR on it, no, have Mr. Spencer's assistant, Mr. Jones handle it," Leila ordered coldly.

Nora was almost in tears, "It was Mr. Jones who told me about this. He said you need to apologize immediately and get Ms. White's forgiveness.Otherwise, he can't help you."

Leila's face went pale.How came?

"Stop talking nonsense!" She hung up and called Ryder.

The call was quickly answered, but it wasn't Ryder's voice.

"Didn't I tell you not to provoke her?" A cold male voice came through,making Leila stiffen.


It was Chris.

"Chris, I didn't mean to. I was just upset and angry. Could you forgive me this once? I won't do it again, please." Her voice was mixed with sobs,evoking pity.


"Apologize." Chris left her with just that cold word.

No more voice from the other end, and the phone showed it was disconnected.


Leila was frozen in place.
"Ms. Ross, leave here immediately and make a public apology to me.promising never to do such a stupid thing again. Otherwise. I won't let it go."

What a joke. Leila had cursed her to her face and bullied her. How could she endure it? Did she really think she would be scared by this?

"You're dreaming!" Leila gritted her teeth andI turned to leave.

She was going to find Chris and had already made up her mind,even if she had to cry or kneel and beg him, she would do it to avoid apologizing to Amelia. If she publicly apologized, she would lose all her dignity.

At Chris's house.

"Chris, I know I was wrong. Just this once, okay? Help me,or I won't survive in the entertainment industry anymore." Leila rushed over and hugged Chris's arm. tears steaming down her face, "I was just upset. She got hurt, and it took all your attention away. I'm not willing to accept it. I hate her."


Chris's face was ice-cold.

"You deserved it." He closed his eyes, picturing Amelia's cold and calm face.


Most likely, when Leila went to provoke her earlier, Amelia didn't even flinch and just treated Leila like a joke.

Amelia was quite impressive. In four years, she had totally reinvented herself.


"Chris, don't do this to me. I know I messed up. You promised me that no matter what, you'd protect me. Have you forgotten?" She cried so hard she
was almost fainting.

Chris took a deep breath, shook off her arm, and looked down at her, "Do you think that incident will protect you forever?"

Leila's whole body trembled. She finally got it-Chris was truly pissed.

But why? Why was he so biased towards that bitch?

"I get it." Leila wiped her tears and painfully stood up.

Fine. It was just an apology.

Chris was still protecting her. As long as he was her fiancé, her status in the entertainment industry wouldn't be a problem.

That night. Leila recorded an apology video.

Facing the camera, she cried and said it was a misunderstanding and that she was under too much mental pressure, which led to her irrational behavior.


"Is this for real? Are celebrities' emotions this unstable?"


"The way she cursed was so scary. It's over, I'm turning from a fan to a hater."


"Is it possible that she's just jealous? The entertainment industry is messy."

Her Instagram comment section was quickly filled with continuous insults,and the popularity she had built over the years vanished in an instant. In less than an hour, she lost tens of thousands of followers.

The management company even sent someone to tell her not to show up for a few days and to stay low to avoid being recognized and causing more
trouble.

"Get out, all of you!" Leila picked up a pillow and threw it at Nora, "You're all here to laugh at me, get out!"

Leila's voice was sharp and terrifying, completely different from her usual glamorous self.

Nora crouched down, holding her head,avoiding the pillow. When she got up, she saw Leila's hysterical and furious state and couldn't help but shiver.


Leila was so scary. Had she literally gone mad?

"Bitch, I won't let you get away with this!" Staring into the quiet void,Leila muttered viciously.

Meanwhile,Amelia was unaffected by this issue and was playing chess with Lucius.


She stared at the board in frustration, having paused for a long time.

He had almost finished a cup of tea, and she still hadn't figured out her next move.


"Chris didn't protect Leila this tíme. It seems his feelings for you have changed," he said.


Amelia's expression stiffened, then she nodded thoughtfullý, "Maybe."

"What's your plan next?" Lucius asked.

His words distracted her, making it harder to decide her next move.

She got up to pour herself a glass of water and took a sip,"I've been
thinking about whether I can get his sperm without physical contact, but it doesn't seem possible."

"Indeed." Lucius's confirmation made her even more disappointed, "But you can't rush it either. You still have time. I'm afraid if you take shortcuts,it will be hard to get out."

That was also her biggest concern.

"Then what about giving him a strong dose or creating some misunderstanding to get his sperm secretly?" She asked.

A complex look flashed in Lucius's eyes. "Is there no other way?"

"No." Amelia smiled bitterly, "This is the method the doctor evaluated to have the highest success rate."
###Chapter 63

Two weeks later, Amelia finally got out of the hospital, and Lucius and Victor were there to pick her up. 
"Bella, I got this scar removal cream made specifically for you. I know you girls care about your looks, so make sure to use it every day, okay?" Victor handed her a fancy royal blue box, his eyes full of affection. 
"Thanks, Mr. Spencer," Amelia said softly, but she caught sight of two familiar figures out of the corner of her eye. It was Chris and Leila. 
"What are you doing here?" Victor asked, clearly annoyed as he glanced at Leila. 
Leila, looking all humble, quickly stepped forward. "Grandpa, Chris and I heard Ms. White was getting discharged today, so we came to visit. I was immature before and misunderstood her. I apologize to Ms. White." She sounded really sincere and handed over a delicate gift box. 
Amelia had no intention to take it, but Victor said, "Since Leila is apologizing sincerely, Bella, you should accept it. You might be family in the future." His words had a deeper meaning. Amelia took the box but didn't open it, planning to toss it later. 
Unexpectedly, Leila insisted, "Ms. White, why don't you open it and take a look?" 
Amelia sighed and opened it, revealing a fancy ladies' diamond watch, sparkling brightly. It was a luxury watch endorsed by Leila, worth over two million dollars. Leila, being a famous celebrity, it was no wonder she would be generous. 
Amelia smirked slightly. "Ms. Ross, you seem serious, but I hope you remember what you said today. I don't want any more drama." 
Leila's face changed, her barely controlled emotions almost bursting out. "Of course," she forced herself to say. 
Chris stood there, looking at Amelia with a cold gaze, like he could see right through her. 
"By the way, Ms. White, I was thinking of commissioning a painting from you. Would you accept my request?" Leila suddenly asked with a smile. 
"Sure," Amelia smiled faintly. Who would say no to money? 
The next day, Leila showed up with a photo. "Ms. White, I want you to paint this photo for me. Can you do it?" Leila crossed her arms, looking at Amelia with a smug smile. 
The photo was of her and Chris, snuggled up together. Leila was smiling down, and Chris was holding her close, his expression tender. Amelia stared at the photo, feeling a bit dazed. It turned out they were quite intimate in private, and she had been completely unaware. 
"Ms. White, what are you thinking?" Leila's high heels clicked, snapping Amelia back to reality. 
"Sorry, I can't paint this," Amelia pushed the photo back. 
Leila raised an eyebrow. "Why? You're supposed to be the most talented painter online, but you can't handle this? Maybe that reputation is self-proclaimed." 
"Are you that bored?" Amelia stood up, gesturing for her to leave. "Please leave." 
Leila was stunned for a moment. "Oh, come on, are you kicking me out? I'll pay you more." 
Before Leila could finish her sentence, Amelia's phone rang. Seeing it was a call from Dora, Amelia immediately got nervous, declined the call, and then turned to Leila. "Leave, or I'll call security." 
Leila shot her a reluctant glare but turned and left. Amelia closed the door and called Dora back. 
"Ms. Tudor, Owen is missing!" Dora's anxious voice came through the phone. It felt like a bolt of lightning struck Amelia's head. 
"What do you mean, Dora? Don't rush, take your time to explain." With that, she grabbed her bag and headed out. "How could Owen go missing? Are you sure he's not just hiding somewhere in the house?" 
"Olivia and I searched the house inside and out, but all we found was a note on the coffee table saying he was leaving. We don't know where he went," Dora's voice was trembling, indicating she was extremely panicked. 
Amelia felt like her heart was frying in oil. She didn't notice that after she left, Leila emerged from behind the decorations at the office door. 
"Owen? Who is that?" Leila looked thoughtfully at Amelia's hurried departure, full of suspicion. She had never seen Amelia so flustered. 
That night, at the airport, the last flight landed, and passengers disembarked one after another. Sophia, pulling her suitcase, was texting Amelia while walking towards the airport exit. In four years, she had changed a lot. She was dressed elegantly, ready to start working at Pinecrest's top hospital. 
[Amelia, I'm at the airport, come pick me up.] 
She didn't notice a small figure with a smaller suitcase slipping away quickly nearby. 
"Whose child is that, without an adult?" someone exclaimed. 
Sophia instinctively turned around, only to see the back of a small child, looking somewhat familiar, like Owen. She didn't pay much attention, thinking Owen was safely in Zephyria. Besides, how could a child under four travel halfway across the world? 
"Don't worry, Owen is very capable," Amelia sighed later. "He's likely already left the airport." 

###Chapter 64
Lucius called Amelia with urgent news: Owen had managed to slip away and was now at the Spencer family’s private hospital, where Victor was recovering.
The news hit Amelia like a physical shock, but she quickly steadied herself. Panic wouldn't save her son. After a tense consultation with Lucius and Sophia, they devised a plan. Sophia would go ahead to claim Owen. As Amelia’s closest friend, Sophia was the only one who could plausibly claim the child was hers without raising immediate suspicion.
"Don't worry, Amelia. I’ll get him back before anyone connects the dots," Sophia promised as she hurried toward the hospital.
Ten minutes later, Amelia and Lucius followed, carrying a selection of high-end nutritional supplements to maintain their cover as concerned visitors.
"Stay focused," Lucius whispered as they stepped into the hospital corridor. "Just follow the lead we’ve established."
Amelia nodded, her heart hammering against her ribs. As they approached Victor’s suite, they heard a sound that stopped Amelia in her tracks—Victor’s hearty, genuine laughter.
"You little rascal, you’ve trapped my queen again!" Victor’s voice sounded more alive than it had in weeks.
"It’s just a simple tactic, Mr. Spencer. You were looking at the wrong side of the board," a soft, childish voice replied. It was Owen, sounding uncharacteristically polite and sweet.
Amelia pushed the door open, and the scene inside was almost surreal. Owen was perched on Victor’s lap, both of them leaning over a tablet displaying a chess game. The room was scattered with toys and snacks—a high-tech robotic dog sat on the coffee table, a testament to Victor’s sudden generosity.
Sophia stood to the side, looking like a mother caught between relief and nervousness.
"Amelia!" Sophia cried out, her acting pitch-perfect. "I can’t believe it! After all this time, you finally show up?"
Amelia took a breath, forcing herself to look at Victor instead of her son. "Mr. Spencer, who are these people?"
"This is a friend of Chris’s... former associate," Victor introduced, his eyes gleaming with affection for the boy on his lap. "She came to collect her son. This bright young man is Owen."
"You... you look just like a friend I used to have," Sophia continued the charade, her eyes welling with tears.
Before Amelia could answer, Owen slid off Victor’s lap. He walked toward Sophia, taking her hand. "Mom, this lady is very pretty. She looks like the lady in your old photos."
Amelia felt a surge of pride. Her son was a natural. "You’re a very charming boy," she said with a faint, distant smile.
Owen blinked, a flash of recognition in his eyes that he quickly masked by hiding behind Sophia. "Mom, I’m shy. Let's go."
"Forgive him, he’s tired," Sophia said, crouching down to hug Owen. "Say goodbye to Mr. Spencer. We’ve disturbed him enough."
Victor stood up, looking at Owen with a wistful expression. "Time flies. He’s a remarkable boy. His father must have been a man of great character."
Sophia’s expression dimmed. "My late husband was... exceptional. He was from Zephyria, which explains Owen’s unique features."
Victor nodded solemnly. From the moment he saw Owen, he had felt an inexplicable bond—the boy reminded him so much of Chris as a child. But Sophia’s explanation seemed to close that door.
"Goodbye," Sophia said, leading Owen toward the door. As they passed Amelia, she paused. "It was a pleasure to meet you, Ms. White. Perhaps we can be friends?"
"I would like that," Amelia replied graciously.
Just as they reached the threshold, the door swung open. Chris stood there, his imposing figure casting a long shadow into the room. Leila followed closely behind him.
Amelia held her breath. Chris’s gaze immediately dropped to the child.
"Whose child is this? He’s adorable," the assistant behind Chris remarked. "Wait... he looks strangely familiar."
"Owen, don't wander off," Sophia said coldly, her voice sharp as she caught sight of Chris and Leila. She tried to move past them, but Chris’s voice stopped her.
"Wait."
The word was like a block of ice. Sophia’s back stiffened. Chris walked up to Owen, his eyes narrowing as he scrutinized the boy’s face.
"You’re very handsome, sir," Owen said, looking up at Chris with wide, innocent eyes. "Almost as handsome as my dad was."
Chris raised an eyebrow, the suspicion in his eyes warring with a sudden, strange curiosity. "And who was your father?"
"That’s none of your business," Sophia interrupted, stepping between them. "We don't have time for interviews."
"Sophia, where are your manners?" Leila sneered, crossing her arms. "We’re just asking a question."
"I have plenty of manners for people who deserve them," Sophia retorted, her voice dripping with disdain. "Unlike some who spend years waiting for a ring that never comes."
Leila’s face turned a brilliant shade of red. "You—!"
"Enough," Chris cut in, his eyes never leaving Owen. "You said he is your son?"
Sophia’s palms were slick with sweat, but Owen didn't falter. He stepped forward, looking Chris directly in the eye. "Yes. Is that a problem?"
The boy stood his ground against Chris’s overwhelming aura, his small reflection mirrored in Chris’s dark eyes. In that moment, Owen thought: So this is him. He’s handsome, but he’s the reason Mom was sad. I won’t let him know who I am.
"Mom, let’s go. This man is making me uncomfortable," Owen said, pulling Sophia’s hand.
They hurried out, leaving a heavy silence in their wake. Amelia and Lucius soon followed, making their excuses to Victor. In the parking garage, they encountered Chris and Leila once more near their cars.
"What a coincidence," Leila said with a forced smile. "It seems we’re all frequenting the same places these days."
Amelia met her gaze with a calm, unbothered expression. "The world is smaller than you think, Ms. Ross. Especially when people are looking for things they’ve lost."

###Chapter 65
Amelia opened the car door, her movements deliberate and calm, ignoring Leila’s piercing gaze. But Leila wasn't finished.
"That boy shares a striking resemblance to you, Ms. White. A bit too much for a coincidence, don’t you think?"
Amelia paused, turning to meet Leila’s eyes with a cool, unbothered stare. "Ms. Ross, if you spent as much time on your rehearsals as you do on these creative fictions, your career might be in a better place."
"Is the boy truly your friend's son?" Chris’s voice cut through the air, low and dangerous. He stepped closer, his shadow falling over Amelia.
Amelia raised an eyebrow, a small, weary smile playing on her lips. "I’ve already introduced him as Sophia’s child. Do I need to provide a notarized family tree for your personal records, Mr. Spencer?"
"Don't test my patience," Chris’s voice turned icy. "His features, his eyes... they remind me of someone."
Amelia’s heart skipped a beat—the fear of exposure was a cold needle in her chest—but she didn't flinch. "He looks like his mother, Sophia. If you’re seeing someone else in a child’s face, perhaps that says more about your own preoccupations than it does about reality."
"His father was from Zephyria," Lucius added, his voice firm and grounding. "Chris, you’re overreaching. Bella has no reason to hide anything from you."
Chris gritted his teeth, his gaze lingering on the car as if he could see through the metal. "I know what I saw," he muttered, though the conviction in his voice wavered under Lucius’s steady presence.
"What exactly is your goal here, Chris?" Amelia asked, her tone softening with a touch of calculated pity. "You have Ms. Ross by your side. Why are you so determined to chase ghosts?"
The question hit Chris harder than a physical blow. He stood silent for a moment, the absurdity of his own fixation momentarily clear to him.
"Let's not delay Ms. White any further, Chris," Leila said, her voice tight with suppressed jealousy. She turned to Amelia. "About the painting for my concert—I’m prepared to pay three times your usual rate. I want the best, and I’m told you’re it."
"If you can meet my fee," Amelia replied, rolling down the window as she settled into the driver’s seat. "Fifteen million dollars. Transfer it by tomorrow, and the piece is yours."
Leila’s expression faltered at the price, but she quickly recovered, clutching Chris’s arm. "If it’s for my art, Chris won’t mind supporting me."
"Whatever it takes," Chris said distractedly, his eyes still tracing the lines of Amelia’s face.
Amelia drove away, the city lights blurring into long streaks of gold. "Are you worried she’ll try something with the painting?" Lucius asked, his expression serious.
"It’s just canvas and oil," Amelia replied, her mind already moving to the scene waiting for her at home.
When she arrived, she found Owen sitting quietly on the sofa. "Owen, come here," she said, her voice stern.
Sophia immediately stood in front of the boy. "Amelia, take a breath. He’s safe."
"Mom, I didn't mean to cause trouble," Owen said, peeking out with a look of genuine remorse. "I just wanted to see him... to see if he was as scary as you said."
Amelia felt the anger drain out of her, replaced by a sharp pang of guilt. "It was dangerous, Owen. You’re in a city where people are looking for any reason to tear us down. You have to be careful."
"I know, Mom. I’m sorry." He walked over and took her hand.
Owen had always been mature for his age, often looking after his younger sister, Olivia, without being asked. It was easy to forget that he was still a child, driven by the same curiosities and needs as any other four-year-old.
"He’s a brave boy, Amelia," Lucius said softly, joining them. "But we’ve taken precautions. His records have been updated; legally, he is Sophia’s son. Not even Chris’s investigators will find a link."
Over the next week, Amelia threw herself into her work. She finished Leila’s commission—a hauntingly lifelike portrait that seemed to capture a depth Leila herself lacked. When Leila came to collect it, she handed Amelia an invitation.
"My concert is next week. Only the inner circle and select media are invited. Chris will be there, of course. I’d love for you to see the painting in its proper setting."
Amelia was prepared to refuse, but the mention of Chris’s attendance changed her mind. It was an opportunity—a chance to observe him in a public setting, to find the cracks in his armor.
"I’ll consider it," Amelia said indifferently.
Leila smirked, crossing her arms. "I still don't know how you’ve managed this act, Bella. To come back after all these years and pretend to be a stranger... it’s impressive."
"I’m not sure what you’re implying, Ms. Ross," Amelia replied, her voice smooth as silk. "But I’ve learned that it’s best not to argue with someone whose reality is so far removed from the truth."
"You’re insufferable!"
"I’m Bella White," Amelia corrected, making a polite gesture toward the door. "And I have work to do."
Leila stormed out, heading straight for the Spencer Group. She waited for hours in Chris’s office until he finally emerged from a meeting.
"Chris, the concert is everything to me," she pleaded, clinging to his arm. "I spent fifteen million on that painting to make sure the buzz is perfect. You have to be there."
Chris looked down at her, his thoughts clearly elsewhere. "I’ll have the funds transferred to your account tonight, Leila. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to finish."

###Chapter 66

Leila's face went stiff. and her eyes got all teary. "Chris, please, don't be like this. You're my fiance. How can you keep being so wrapped up in work and ignoring me? If you keep treating me like this. I'm gonna get depressed. Don't you care about me at all?"

Tears started to roll down her cheeks.

Chris's face showed a flicker of impatience. "I don't have time."

"Even Ms. White will be there. Despite being busy, she managed to paint for me.. Could you please just show up for a bit?" Leila tried a different approach.


To her surprise. Chris hesitated and relented. "I'll check my schedule."

He had just flat-out refused, but after she mentioned Bella, he changed his tune instantly.


Leila was so mad she clenched her teeth.

She couldn't help but blame Amelia even more.

'But it doesn't matter,' she thought. 'On the day of the concert, everything will be sorted out.'


In the morning, Amelia and Sophia took Owen to kindergarten together. It was about time for him to start school.

"Goodbye, Mommy," Owen said, carrying his little backpack as he walked through the gate.

Amelia wiped her eyes.
"Time flies. It feels like just yesterday I had him, and now he's off to school,"she sighed.

Sophia sighed too. "Owen's a bit of a loner. I wonder if he'll get along with the other kids."


She pinpointed the exact concern that Amelia also had.

Owen had always been solitary, not really into playing with kids his age.When asked, he'd reluctantly say, "They'retoo childish,too boring,not interesting."


Amelia felt a bit helpless.

"It's okay. We can always talk to his teacher. She'll let us know if anything happens," Sophia reassured her.


They turned and saw Chris standing by his black SUV, watching them quietly with one hand in his pocket.


Amelia felt her heart buoy into the back of her throat. 'Damn it, why is he everywhere?


"Don't panic," Sophia said. "Let's just walk away and ignore him."

But before they could reach their car, Chris had already walked over.

"Let's talk," he said, looking at Amelia.

"Not interested." She didn't even glance at him. "Please move."

"Do you dare say that child has nothing to do with you, Amelia? What are you trying to do?" Chris grabbed Amelia's wrist tightly, and no matter how much she struggled, it was useless.
"Of course, he has something to do with me." Amelia sneered."I acknowledged that child as my godson. Is that not allowed?"

Sophia quickly added. "That's right. My son likes to draw and hit it off with Ms. White. What's wrong with that?"

"Impossible!" Chris gritted his teeth,staring into Amelia's eyes, not missing any hint of emotion.


"What's impossible? You think he's your son? That's ridiculous." Amelia laughed in anger. "Or do you think I'm Amelia, that I didn't die four years ago, and I secretly had your baby, hid for a few years, and then brought him back without acknowledging you? Chris, if that's the case, what would be my motive? What would I gain?"

She made a good point. It didn't make sense.

She coldly shook off Chris's hand. "Mr. Spencer, please stay away from us and stop being crazy."


They drove away.

"I still think it's dangerous. How about we send Owen away?" Sophia sighed.


Amelia shook her head, "No, that would just make them more suspicious."

All she could do now was keep the secret, no matter what.

And she had toreach her goal as soon as possible.

Time flew by, and soon it was the day of Leila's concert.

Amelia showed up with Lucius, and out of the blue, Sophia and Owen were there too.
"I couldn't resist your son. He insisted on coming, saying his classmates would be here too." Sophia said, spreading her hands, looking a bit helpless.

Owen nodded seriously, "Yeah. Mommy, my classmate's name is Raymond Spencer. We became friends."

Raymond Spencer? Amelia didn't remember anyone by that name.

"Raymond is a relative of Dad's brother and also related to Chris," Lucius explained.

"Since we're all here, let's go in together. There are a lot of people around,and we need to keep a close eye on the kid. Besides, Chris might not even show up," he added.


The concert was at this fancy opera house, with luxury cars parked outside and celebrities and wealthy businessmen everywhere. When Lucius and Amelia arrived, many people who usually only appeared in financial news came over to greet them.

She hadn't anticipated these people would be supportive of Leila. Or rather.Chris was really pulling out all the stops for her, inviting so many big shots to back her up.


Inside the venue, more than half the seats were already filled.

No sooner had Amelia and Sophia taken their seats than Owen disappeared in the blink of an eye.

"Owen might have gone to the bathroom. He mentioned it while we were in the car," Sophia said, taking out a small mirror to touch up her lipstick."I wonder if I'll meet any handsome guys later and have a little romance."
Amelia was at a loss whether to laugh or cry, Whats so great about romance? At best, it's minor troubles, at worst, it could cost you half your life."

"Don't be so pessimistic. Aren't you doing well now, with a son and a
daughter?" Sophia smiled.

Amelia fell silent and didn't respond.

Meanwhile. Owen and Raymond had sneaked backstage.

Raymond was smaller than Owen, but he didn't slow Owen down. They quickly avoided the crowd and hid in the dressing room behind thick curtains.


After a while, Leila came in, looking at herself in the mirror, thinking she looked perfect.


"Chris, why aren't you here yet? It's about tostart," she called Chris."
Anyone else can be absent, but not you. You are my spiritual support, you know?"


"I'm on my way," Chris's voice was as indifferent as ever on the phone.

"Okay, love you," Leila immediately perked up.

She picked up the painting next to her and examined it carefully.

"That bitch's painting is nothing special. She even calls herself a great artist,what a joke, shameless and disgusting!" Leila sneered and casually threw the painting on the sofa.

"If it weren't useful, I wouldn't even care." She twisted her waist and adjusted her dress, ready to go on stage.
The dress she was wearing had been ordered three months in advance.with over eight thousand diamonds meticulously embedded.It was not only a rare perfect dress but also a valuable piece of art.

She could already imagine the shock o people's faces when she appeared
in this dress.

Unexpectedly, a small figure rushed out at that moment,so fast and strong that it knocked her to the ground.
###Chapter 67

Leila feIt a sharp pain, like someone had kicked her hard in the stomach.making it spasm.

She lay on the ground for a few seconds before managing to get up by holding onto the wall.

As soon as she stood up, she noticed a long tear in the hem of her skirt.completely ruining its original beauty.

"Haha, serves you right!" A kid at the door was gleefully shaking his butt at her.


Leila felt dizzy, and by the time she looked up, the kid had already run off.

She was furious and shouted, "Nora! Nora!"


Nora rushed in, "What's wrong? Oh my god, how did your dress get torn?"

Leila gritted her teeth, "Get me the surveillance footage, find out who came in here just now."


Nora nodded and asked, "What should we do now about your dress?"

"Go get the spare one," A look of regret flashed in Leila's eyes, and she scolded loudly, "It's all your fault. Why weren't you watching over me? Go get it now!"


Owen, who was hiding behind the curtains, took the chance to sneak out unnoticed.


The two kids met up in the banquet hall.

Raymond's little face was lit up with excitementas he covered his mouth
and said to Owen, "You should've seen the look on that wicked Leila's face.so pale."

Owen's brows drew together,"What if she finds out?"

Raymond waved his hand nonchalantly, "I'm the only kid in the family.what can that wicked Leila do to me? You know what? She is all smiles in front of you but stabs you in the back. Last year on my birthday,she was so nice to me in front of others, but as soon as they left, she called me a jinx because I accidentally stepped on her skirt."

Owen's expression was thoughtful, "No wonder you're displeased with her."

Raymond put his arm around Owen's shoulder and headed towards Sophia, "Listen, as long as I don't agree, she can never marry my uncle.".

"You're that powerful?" Owen looked at him with admiration but was clearly skeptical.

Raymond immediately stopped, "Of course, just wait and see."


"Owen." Sophia noticed them, "Where did you go just now? Is this the classmate you mentioned?"

Owen nodded, looking like a little adult, "We went to the restroom.This is Raymond Spencer."

Raymond sweetly called out, "Hello, MMrs. Tudor, you're so beautiful."

He looked at Sophia, then at his friend, and scratched his head suspiciously.

"Why don't you two look alike? Everyone says I look just like my mom."He asked.
Sophia's face stiffened. Owen wasn't her biological child, so it would be strange if they looked alike.

"I look like my dad. My dad is dead." Owen spoke softly, "Raymond, don't bring this up again. It makes my mom and me sad."

Raymond looked apologetic, nodded, and went to his family.

Sophia pulled Owen to sit next to Amelia and told her about the conversation.


Amelia was briefly startled, increasingly feeling that her son didn't seem like a four-year-old child.

"Owen. try not to talk too much in crowded places. The more you say, the more mistakes you might make, understand?" She patted Owen's head and advised.


Suddenly, a low sneer sounded behind her.

Amelia immediately stiffened, knowing without turning around who it was.

"Ms. White, are you overstepping your bounds?" Chris stared at her ears with a half-smile, his intense gaze making Amelia feel extremely irritated.

She took a deep breath, put on a smile, and turned to look at him,speaking in an exceptionally tender tone, "Mind your own business and leave me alone"


Chris raised an eyebrow and smirked, "Is this how Ms. White talks to her savior? People might think you're a heartless shrew if word got out."

What a venomous man!

"Ms. White is not a shrew. She's very kind to me, like a beautiful fairy." At
this moment. Owen stood up. "I don't allow you to talk about Ms.White like that."

It's amazing how a kid like him could always remember so many titles accurately and say them at the right time.

Chris glanced at him and changed the subject, "What's your name?"

"I don't like you, and I don't want to tell you." Owen turned and sat next to Sophia,ignoring Chris.

Amelia felt delighted and couldn't help but tease, "Mr. Spencer, you are quite a loser, even a child doesn't like you."


Chris replied coldly, "Luckily, he's not my son, or I'd spank him."


Amelia quickly fired back, "Whoever becomes your son is unlucky. But with Mr. Spencer's wedding to Ms. Ross approaching,you'll probably have a son soon. I hope you won't be looked down upon in the future."


Chris's face turned cold, and a chill emanated from him.


At this moment, the host took the stage and introduced the concert's program. The first part was the grand entrance of the main character, Leila.Amelia glanced absentmindedly,feeling puzzled.

Today was supposed to be Leila's big day, but why was she wearing an ordinary evening gown?

Although the gown was paired with extravagant diamond jewelry, it couldn't hide the dullness of the white satin dress.

All the lights in the venue went out, leaving only a soft spotlight on Leila.However,the effect was mediocre because the large diamonds on her ears
and neck refracted the light, making her face somewhat blurry.

As a result, the audience and media had little reaction,and some even whispered that she couldn't carry off the jewelry.

Leila's eyes reddened wwith anger.

Originally, the spotlight and her stunning diamond dress were supposed to complement each other, making her shine like a princess. Her team had even conducted a simulation experiment for this.


But she couldn't back down.

She had more important things to do.

"Before the concert begins, I have something to announce." She smiled and glanced backstage.


Nora immediately brought up the painting.

Seeing the painting, Amelia's expression stiffened.

It was the one she had painted.

"What's going on? We're here for a concert."

"Yeah,why bring out a painting covered with cloth?"

"What are they doing, making it so mysterious?"

The audience whispered among themselves.

"Everyone,please bear with me for a moment." Leila began her monologue.
"Today is a very important day for me. The people who care about and support me are all here,including the person I love the most."

The audience immediately applauded, like thunder.

Amelia couldn't help but frown. Was Leila goingto confess?

Chris was right behind her, and she wondered what he was thinking.

"Thank you all for your support. I'm very excited." She smiled,seemingly with tears in her eyes, "When I came back, I said I would win back my first love, and today is the day."


She looked towards the audience, in Chris's direction.
###Chapter 68

The audience was dimly lit, but not pitch black; they could still make out the people around.

Chris,being the attention magnet he was, had already become the center of focus even before he showed up. Naturally, everyone was watching his every move.

But right now, he remained apathetic. "Mom, what's happening? Is this okay for kids?" Owen whispered to Sophia.

Sophia looked intrigued, "I think that pretty lady on stage is about to propose to someone she likes."


Owen was taken aback, "Why is a girl proposing? Isn't that something guys do?"

Sophia was momentarily at a loss for words.

Meanwhile, Leila continued, "I've known him for many years. I'll never forget his care, love, support, and help during this time. Today, I want to take advantage of this special day."


As she spoke, she slowly pulled the red cloth off the painting,revealing its content.


Everyone was surprised. The people in the painting were clearly Leila and Chris.


They were tightly embracing, looking particularly intimate.

The artist who painted this picture was truly skilled. Every detail was handled so perfectly that even the strands of hair appeared to flow and
come to life, leaving everyone in awe.

"This painting is great. I wonder how much it cost."

"Could it be painted by some famous artist? It's amazing."

"This painting must be expensive, probably custom-made by her."

Amidst the chatter, Chris stared intently at the painting.

The style of the painting was unmistakably Amelia's work.


His face darkened.

"You are so impressive, taking on any job. How desperate for money are you?" He sneered,grabbing Amelia's seat and pulling it back.

Caught off guard, Amelia and the chair were about to fall into his arms.


She instinctively grabbed Lucius's arm beside her, who immediately helped steady the chair, "Chris, don't cause trouble."

"What's it to you?" Chris gritted his teeth coldly.

Chris's sharp gaze swept across Amelia's profile, like the cold glint of a dagger.


At this moment, Leila said, "Chris, I love you. Let's get married."

The crowd was in an uproar.

Leila had actually proposed, and to the famous CEO of the Spencer Group,Chris.


All eyes were on Chris, except for Amelia.

Everyone watched the slender figure in the audience,while Chris's cold face was covered with a frosty expression.

He stood up and walked step by step onto the stage.

He stood shoulder to shoulder with Leila, while his gaze remained on Amelia,as if wanting to prove something.

"Chris, I knew it." Leila was excited, rushing into Chris's arms and hugging him tightly.

Chris's tall body stiffened, and he lowered his voice, whispering something in Leila's ear, causing her face to change instantly.

Then, Chris pushed her away and turned to leave the stage.

Everyone looked puzzled, wondering if he had agreed or not.

The concert continued, but Amelia had no intention to watch anymore and got up to go to the restroom.

The mirror reflected her distressed look, almost exposing her inner turmoil and discomfort.


She lowered her head, placing her hands on the sink, trying to clear all the thoughts inher mind.


She kept telling herself not to get emotional or reveal her identity, and she had to stay calm.

But her heart keened. It had been four years,why did she still have feelings for Chris?

Amelia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and opened them again.
In the large, bright mirrot there was another person.It was Chris!

Amelia's oyes widened, thinking she was seeing things,or maybe her emotions were to overwheiming that she was halluwinating. But it was him.
"What, heanbroken?" Chris's lips curled into a faint smile, gently hugging her from behind, his lnrge hand pressing against her abdomen,sending a chill through her.

Hitting the mark, Amelia reflexively tried to push him away, "You're pervert, this is the women's restroom!"

"What are you afraid of?" Chris held her tighter, whispering in her ear,No one will come here at this time."

With that, he directly wrapped his arm around her waist,forcibly taking her to a stall and closing the door behind them.

"What are you doing? Your fiancée is outside!" Amelia struggled and shouted,her blood humming.

But the space was too small, and with a gentle push from Chris,she lost her balance and sat on the toilet lid.


In the cramped space, Chris's tall figure filled her senses, bringing a strong sense of oppression.


Amelia was forced to look up, meeting his gaze, and realized his expression was cold and somewhat frightening. He was angry.

"Chris, stop this. There are so many people outside. If they find out we're here..."


"So what? Who would dare say a word? Amelia, don't think I have no
idea what you're up to. Getting close to me with all these tricks, playing hard-to-get, isn't it all toachieve some unspeakable goal? You do have patience. What exactly do you want?" Chris's voice was extremely icy and impatient.


Amelia's stomach gave a decisive downward jolt. He had seen through everything.

No, she couldn't admit it. This was exactly the effect she wanted.


She lightly pursed her lips and smiled, "Because I want to help Mr.Howard. I'm his girlfriend, you1 know that."

Chris looked daggers at her, as if wanting to devour her.


Amelia slowly stood up, her soft hand gently brushing his cheek, her voice particularly coy, "Mr. Spencer probably doesn't know that the project leader of the Wilson Group, who you've been in touch with recently,just landed half an hour ago and is currently meeting with Mr. Howard's assistant. Mr. Howard's offer is much better than yours. Who do you think the big boss will choose?"

"So, Lucius used you to provoke me, to mess with my mind, just to strike at me?" Chris grabbed her neck, applying a bit of pressure, full of threat.

Amelia raised an eyebrow and smiled, saying nothing.

"You think I'll believe that?" Chris pushed her back to her original position,"The chairman of the Wilson Group has a daughter named Chloe Wilson.She's liked Lucius for many years. Did you know that Lucius used to avoid her, never getting involved with the Wilson Group? Later, after I suppressed him to the extent of having no way out, he started selling his looks to get close to Chloe. You two are..."
"That's bullshit!" Amelia's pupils suddenly contracted. "He would never abandon me, nor would he ever betray me. He must be using her!"

Her emotions visibly intensified, her eyes full of anger and panic.

"Are you worried about losing him?" Chris leaned down, his complex gaze sweeping over her pink lips.

"He's my boyfriend!" Before she could finish her sentence,her mouth was sealed with a domineering kiss.

Chris pressed down on her, pinning her hands above her head.
###Chapter 69

The kiss that took her breath away landed on her lips,cending s ruch of anxiety through her, but there was also a spark of eacitement.

She figured she might as well use this chance to get what she wansed.She was in her ovulation period, so maybe she could get pregnant right tow.

"Let go of me," she pretended to struggle.

Feeling her resistance. Chris held her even tighter,freeing one hand to caress her slender waist.


"Lucius stole my business,so I'll saral his girlfriend." Chris suddenly bt her go,his eyes cold and sneering. "Seema faie to me."

Amelia's hair was a mess. her lipoarek ameared. and her dress wrinkird making her look complesely dishroeind.

She glared at him fiersely,grining har tauth. "You re despuable and shameless, Leila is just ousside. If she fiedis oue.."

"Then you should blame yourseif for seducing me." Chris pulled heruP leaning close to her ear, and said slowly. "And aren't you mad?You came to seduce me for Lucius, but he has been cheating on you."

"That's not possible."

"Why not? Do you think he's a saint? Chloe is the only daughter of the Wilson family. Marrying her is way more beneficial than marrying someone useless like you."

It was difficult to distinguish between what was true and what was faine Every word was dripping with heavy temptation.
At least at this moment, he had genuine desire for her.

"He wouldn't," her gaze turned empty and desolate.

"Only a fool woman like you would think he's pure and flawless. He's got a thousand faces," Chris pinched her chin, coaxing, "He betrayed you. Don't you want to know what it feels like to betray him too?"

He smiled faintly, his eyes burning with intensity.

Amelia's expression changed, staring straight at him, her eyes filled with emotion.


The next second, she broke free, wrapped her arms around his neck, and kissed him hard on the lips.

She mumbled. "Then let's fall together."

Desire reached its peak at that moment.

Their breaths mingled, heavy with passion. Soon, her dress was half off.barely hanging around her waist, leaving only her pure white underwear on her upper body.

With just a glance at her breasts, Chris's eyes turned red. He bit her neck hard,making her gasp,

Meanwhile, his hands roamed up her back, quickly grasping her full,ample breasts.

Amelia's body had already begun to produce arousal fluids. She frantically tore at his clothes, accidentally ripping off a button, revealing his eight-pack abs.
could ignite Amelia's intense lust.

They clung tightly together, kissing each other madly. At that moment,Amelia forgot everything, as if time had rewound to a few years ago.

Soon, he grabbed her hand, guiding it to his already hard cock.

"Chris, where are you?" Suddenly, a familiar voice called out faintly.

Amelia stiffened abruptly. It was Leila.

Chris's face changed noticeably, a trace of impatience flashing in his eyes.He urgently tried to kiss Amelia again, but she pushed him away.

"Aren't you afraid she'll come in and see this?" Amelia tried to escape from his embrace.


Chris chuckled lowly, holding her waist tightly and roughly, pulling her into his arms. "You're so horny, are you really afraid of being caught?"

"Of course. I'm Lucius's girlfriend now. He can offer me moe,"she said with a smírk, lifting his chin playfully. "You're just my gigolo when I look for fun. Big difference."


Chris's eyes darkened with anger. "What if Lucius dumps you?"

His eyes were full of possessiveness, burning fiercely.

Amelia frowned. "He won't."

"Well,we'll see," Chris said with a knowing smile.

"Chris," Leila's voice was getting closer.
walking in and making things awkward."

She let her messy hair down, giving his penis a flirty squeeze. "Mr. Spencer,I was actually looking forward to it."


Chris's eyes darkened like a predator in the night, but then he relaxed and smiled. "You're not bad either."


"Better wipe that lipstick off your face," Amelia said, pushing him away and walking out.


She was touching up her lipstick in the restroom when Leila burst in.

"Amelia, what are you doing here?" Leila asked, noticing her disheveled appearance. "Where's Chris?"

Amelia glanced at her coolly. "How would I know? Ms. Ross, maybe you should keep a better eye on him instead of asking others where your boyfriend is."


Leila stepped forward, gritting her teeth. "Did you seduce him? Tell me,where is he now?"


"Ms. Ross, don't be so harsh. I have to go," Amelia said, putting away her lipstick and turning to leave.


But Leila grabbed her arm. "You smell like his aftershave. He was just with you."


Her tone was certain.

Amelia raised an eyebrow, lowering her voice provocaively. "Yes,so why not go confront him and see if he'll admitit?"
A few years ago.whe this trick, sleeping with Chris and taking intimate photos to provoke her.

Now it was the other way around. How ridiculous.

"You bitch," Leila spat, her anger making her speechless. She wanted to strangle Amelia.


Everyone knew she had publicly confessed to Chris, but his response had been ambiguous.


If people found out Chris had been intimate with Amelia, she'd be humiliated.


"Keep looking, I'm leaving," Amelia said with a faint smile, turning to go.

Leila was trembing with rage but quickly composed herself and left the restroom.


As a woman, she knew exactly what Amelia had done and where Chris was.


But did she dare to confront him? No way. She couldn't do it.

"Ms. White, let's go back together," Owen said, stepping forward to hold Amelia's hand as she came out.


There were only a few people left outside, and a cold wind blew, bringing Amelia back to her senses.


"Sure, let's go," she said, smiling and holding Owen's hand as theygot into Sophia's car.


"Mr. Howard left midway, said he had something urgent," Sophia mentioned.
Amelia glanced at her watch. "He's probably meeting Chloe by now."

In recent years, Lucius had been expanding his overseas assets aggressively,and many of his domestic businesses had been absorbed by Chris. If he couldn't recover some of them this time, the cash flow would break,and the consequences would be unimaginable.


That was the main reason he was willing to meet Chloe.
###Chapter 70

The media shockingly didn't cover what went down that night.

Leila proposing to Chris was such juicy gossip, but it only caused a buzz among the people who were at the concert,which was totally unexpected.

"Maybe Mr. Spencer still has a thing for you and isn't into other women,"Sophia teased.

Amelia sighed, "You're reading too much into it. He just doesn't want all that attention, that's all."

Even though she said that, Amelia couldn't help but think back to that night in the bathroom with Chris.

Three days had passed with nothing happening, and she hadn't heard a peep from Chris. She was starting to get a bit anxious.

"Mom, can you and Ms. Parker pick me up from school tomorrow?" Just as her mind was wandering, Owen ran over, grabbing her hand,his cute little face full of expectation.

Owen was usually distant and rarely looked like this.

Amelia's heart melted instantly, "Sure, whatever you want."

"Then can you call Olivia, mom? I miss her," Owen handed her the phone considerately.

"Okay, I'll call Olivia right now." Amelia patted Owen's head,studying his face,once again reluctantly admitting how much he looked like Chris.

It seemed like that they were made from the same mold, especially their
facial features.

The video call connected quickly.

"Mom!" Olivia cried, her voice all choked up, "I want to come to you too.Owen's there with you, why can't I be? I want to be with Mom and Owen!"

"Listen, Olivia, Owen came back to help me. It's not safe here. Just stay with Dora,okay?"

"No!" Olivia started crying, and the nanny beside her tried to comfort her.

Amelia's heart ached, "Olivia, I'll bring Owen back to see you in a few days,okay? Once I finish what I need to do, we'll come back, and we won't be apart again."

She had to speed things up to achieve her goal. Playing hard to get at this pace was just wasting time.

She could wait,but could Olivia?

That night,some news spread among the insiders.

Lucius had dinner with Chloe, the daughter of the Wilson Group's chairman, and then Lucius's car drove into Chloe's villa.

Because of the power of both families, no one dared to say anything openly, but everyone knew what was up.

Amelia went straight to Luciuas's place, waited outside most of the night,and when Lucius came back, they had a big fight outside the villa and parted on bad terms.

Amelia headed to the bar Chris often hung out at.
In the booth, she drank glass after glass, her face already flushed.

"Got dumped, huh?" A familiar voice came from behind,making Amelia tense up.

Chris had truly shown up as she guessed.

"Get lost." Amelia downed another glass, only to choke and cough, her face turning red.

Chris raised an eyebrow and smiled. Instead of leaving, he walked around and sat in front of her, quietly watching her drink.

She kept drinking; the strong liquor burned her throat, sharp and intense,and tears started to flow from her eyes.

Chris frowned, "Do you have to act so convincingly? I almost bought it."

Amelia didn't say a word, called the waiter, and got him a large beer mug.filling it herself.

"Drink!" she demanded boldly, but her broken appearance made him feel somewhat concerned for her. "You can't outdrink me," Chris said without hesitation. He picked up the mug and took a sip, holding it asgracefully as if it were a wine glass.

They went back and forth, drinking and enjoying themselves.

Gradually, Chris's face started to show signs of drunkenness. His deep eyes became darker as he stared at her flushed face, not saying a word for a long time.

When did she learn to drink? The old Amelia would get drunk after one glass of alcoholic drink; she couldn't handle her liquor at all.
"What are you looking at? Keep drinking!" Amelia sneered. "I'm so pathetic, betrayed and abandoned by the boyfriend I trusted,making a fool of myself in front of you. How ridiculous."

"He never had much genuine affection for youa. Lucius is the coldest and most heartless," Chris said, as if he saw through everything. "He only appears to be a gentleman, but his methods are dirty and despicable in private, yet you all trust him."

"I do trust him. He waited for me for so many years. We grew up together in the orphanage. All these years, I've only had him in my heart. We..."

"Shut up!" Chris impatiently gritted his teeth and rudely poured her a large glass. "Aren't you a drinker? Then keep drinking."

Amelia didn't get angry but laughed, then picked up the glass and downed it.


The next second, her stomach cramped, and she turned her head,vomiting all over Chris.

"Amelia!" Chris roared in anger, wanting to strangle her.

The waiter hurried over, helping to clean up Amelia and bringing clean clothes for Chris.


After that, Amelia passed out drunk.

When she came to, Amelia found herself thrown onto a soft, wide bed by Chris.

Her back pressed against the cool sheets, her sanity slowly returning.

Someone was showering inthe bathroom, most likely Chris.
This time, she had to seize the opportunity and exhaust all his energy.

"Awake?" Chris leisurely walked out of the bathroom, only a towel wrapped around his waist, his bare upper body muscular and full, his eight-pack abs particularly eye-catching.

He stood in front of her, his arrogant aura, along with his lazy tone and gaze. was extremely oppressive.

Amelia endured the headache and asked him. "Aren't you afraid Ms. Ross will come looking for you? She's devoted to you."

"That's none of your business." Chris's eyes quickly flashed with displeasure,then he threw off the towel and climbed onto her.

The bed beside her sank under his knees and elbows, a faint woody scent invading her nostrils, surprisingly refreshing. Chris always smelled like this.

"Ms. Tudor, or Ms. White, have you achieved your goal today, at this moment?" Chris propped up an arm, looking at her with a half-smile, as if trying to see through her.

Amelia closed her eyes.

"Speak." Chris was relentless, gripping her shoulder.

"Yes!" Amelía sneered, suddenly flipping over, pinning him down,straddling him.

Her gaze turned fierce, staring straight into his eyes, enunciating each word."Lucius cheated on me, so it's fair. He wronged me first, I'm not the one to be blamed!"

Her eyes were full of angry flames, in an instant, she seemed like a
different person.

She kissed his lips, her hand moving down, quickly grasping his penis.

Chris gasped, sitting up, tearing off her dress in retaliation.


Her skin exposed to the air, a chill hit her.

Amelia suddenly felt a faint pain in her lower abdomen.
###Chapter 71

Right after that, she felt a warm rush.

That familiarfeeling.Crap!

"Let go of me," she struggled,trying to push him away.

Chris's eyes were cold and unyielding, holding her tight and kissing her wildly. his desire completely captured him.

"Release me!" Amelia's voice grew stronger, and she slapped him,"Stop!"

Chris froze, gritting his teeth, "Don't push it. I don't care what you say,I am definitely having sex with you today!"

"Not today!" Amelia pulled back, trying to escape, but he grabbed her waist and pulled her down.

He pressed her shoulders and bit her neck.

"I'm on my period, did you hear me? Do you still want to make love?"Amelia shouted.

She was incredibly unlucky. She finally got such a rare opportunity, just one step away from success, and then her period came.

Chris's face was extremely grim.

He stiffly stood up, staring at her for a long time before squeezing out,"Are you fucking playing me?"

Amelía was also helpless and frustrated, just about to respond when a familiar dull pain hit her. Unprepared, she cried out and curled up in pain,rolling onto the bed.
"Mr. Spencer, could you help me buy some pads?" She gasped in pain.looking at him with pleading eyes.

Chris's face was livid, laughing in anger. "You mean, not only do I have to drink with you, but I also have to take care of you? Dream on!"

A few minutes later, he called room service to bring several packs of pads and a new set of clothes.

"Get up, the pads are here!" Chris pulled her up from the bed.only to find her forehead covered in cold sweat, looking as if she had just been pulled out of the water.

"Are you going to die?" He squinted his eyes suspiciously.

Amelia took a deep breath, standing up with the help of the bed, "Not now.



She experienced complications during childbirth that led to her developing dysmenorrhea. Every time she had her period, the pain was unbearable.

So every month during hee period, she could only lie at home.

She changed into new underwear in the bathroom but couldn't get up from the toilet seat duie to the intense pain.

Chris knocked on the door outside, "Hey,are you still alive?"

Hearing this, Amelia's head buzzed.

A few seconds later, hearing no response from Amelia, Chris broke in. He saw her with her head pressed against the wall, one hand clutching her waist, the other bracing her knee, and her face contorted in pain.

"Do you need to go to the hospital?" He asked worriedly.
Amelia was about to speak when a more intense pain hit her, knocking her out.

"Hey, hey!" Chris hurriedly picked her up and rushed to the hospital.

The whole night, Chris stayed by her side in the hospital room, not leaving until she woke up at dawn.

"Thank you, Mr. Spencer," her voice was hoarse and strained, "You saved my life again, I actually don't know how to thank you."

"If you wvant to thank me, then marry me," Chris raised an eyebrow at her,a mocking look in his eyes.

Amelia pressed her lips together, "The man I like is Mr. Howard."

"But he betrayed you. He's already with Chloe, and the Wilson family is backing him against me. Chloe's way more valuable to him than you are.You're deluding yourself! Dumb ass!" Chris suddenlystood up,looking helplessly at her.

Anyone who didn't knowhim might think he was saying it for Amelia's sake.


"But he treats me well too. He's just using Chloe," Amelia wiped away tears.

Chris put one hand on his hip, pacing the room, "He's using you too, to seduce me and split my assets. Isn't her plan already working? And you're defending him, you fool!"

Amelia silently shed tears,saying nothing.

Chris glared at her, "Only a fool like you would think he's a good guy."
"But I don't like you," Amelia pondered for a moment, looking up at him, "I have no feelings for you."

Chris was silent.

Fine! In aIl of Pinecrest, every single woman liked him. Was she the exception?

"You've piqued my interest," Chris gritted his teeth.

Before he finished speaking, a tall, slender figure appeared at the door.It was Lucius.

Amelia's eyes lit up when she saw him, but then dimmed, snorting coldly,Why are you here, not with your Ms. Wilson?"

Lucius took a few quick steps in, putting down what he was holding,"You know I'm just playing along with her, a cooperative relationship. it's different from us."

Chris sneered, turning to leave.

"Wait," Lucius called after him, "Chris, what are you doing here?"

Chris's back was cold, mocking, "Why don't you ask that fool why she got her period when she was about to sleep with me?"

"Shut up!" Amelia was shocked, jumping up, "Mr. Spencer, don't talk nonsense!"


She was furious, driven by a profound sense of shame.

Chris turned around, looking at her flushed face, the vicious, threatening look in her eyes, feeling a wave of annoyance in his chest.
"Isn't it true? Didn't you go drinking because of his betrayal, didn't you get drunk and throw up on me, didn't you try to seduce me for sex to get back at him? If it weren't for your period, you and I would have been in the hotel bed, what are you pretending for?"

Chris stared sharply into her eyes, saying each word slowly,feeling extremely satisfied.

At this moment, his words were no longer under his control. He desperately wanted to separate them, to possess her in a whole.

He didn't want to be a secret lover anymore, only coveting her in the darkness anymore!

"You're crazy!" Lucius punched him in the face, "You think I'll believe that?



Chris's tall body swayed, standing there without fighting back,casually wiping the blood from his lip.

Then he said indifferently, "I'll take that punch,from now on,your girlfriend is mine."

"Chris, get out!" Amelia glared at him fiercely, "I hate you!"

Chris laughed,"Whatever. As long as I have a bit of affection for you,I won't allow you to be anyone else's girlfriend!"

With that, he turned to leave.

He had been gone for a while before Lucius got up and closed the door tightly.

"Looks like you're making progress, not bad," he looked at Amelia quietly,
his gare seemed a bit complicated.

Ametia got up and looked downstairs from the window. Chvie was just walking out, taking big strides, his back lookipg carefree and decisive.

I don't know if what I'm doing is right"she murmured

Lucius said. "T'll support you no matter what."
###Chapter 72

Lucius stared at her retreating figure, his eyes deep and calm.

He realized he hadn't thought about the real Bella in ages.

In the past four years, with his constant guidance, Amelia had become almost a mirror image of Bella.

But what about his feelings? Had they changed too, without him even noticing?

Lucius didn't want to dwell on it. Whatever she wanted to do,he'd support her. The rest was up to fate.

Amelia stayed at the hospital during the daytime and then headed to Lucius's place in the evening.

It was ráining, and she pounded heavily on the gate outside the villa.Despite people being inside,no one answered.

"Isn't she Mr. Howard's girlfriend? Why not let her in?"

"You're new here and might not know it's Mr. Howard's order."

"Looks like they broke up. Anyway, she's not allowed in."

The security guards whispered among themselves.

Amelia waited for a while, and when no one opened the gate, she started shouting in the rain.

About half an hour later, a black Ferrari pulled up at the g

Chris got out, took a few steps forward, grabbed her arm,a
with me!"

Amelia turned to see his stern face and immediately got angry, hitting and punching him, "This is all your fauld"

"Whatever." He picked her up and tossed her into his car, then sped off.

Amelia fussed with him the whole way, but it didn't change his mind about taking her back to his villa.

"When you are on the right track, I'll let you out." With that,he left.

Amelia was placed in the bedroom she had once stayed in, and everything inside was just as it had been.

She couldn't help but sneer, wondering what he was planning with such meticulous care.

At breakfast the next morning, Chris unexpectedly showed up in the dining room. Amelia had just finished eating and was ready to head back to the studio for work.

Seeing her so calm and composed, Chris got curious, "You've figured it out so quickly. Don't worry, I'm way better than Lucius, in every way."

Amelia ignored him and got up to grab her bag.

"Where are you going?" Chris frowned.

"Back to work. So what if my boyfriend left me? I still have a life to live."Amelia glared at him, "I have a client meeting today, and in the afternoon,I need to pick up my godson from school with Sophia."

Chris's face darkened, clearly displeased. 'Damn Amelia, so stubborn.Let's see how this plays out.'
At three in the afternoon, Amelia left work early and went with Sophia to the kindergarten to pick up Owen.

"You haven't seen Owen these past few days. You don't know, he's been doing so well at kindergarten. The teachers keep praising him to me."Sophia held her arm, looking proud.

Amelia felt a bit guilty, "I'm sorry, Sophia. I should be the one taking care of him, but now you're helping me with my child, spending all your time."

Sophia glared at her, "Hey, don't be so formal and relax. You know I'm childfree for life. With Owen and Olivia as my lovely godchildren, I'm happier than ever. Besides, I didn't do much, just covered for you. The nanny is the one taking care of the kids."

The two chatted and laughed, and soon the school bell rang. Parents gathered around, eagerly waiting for their kids with smiles on their faces.

When the kids came out with their teacher, Amelia immediately spotted Owen at the front. Her eyes lit up, and she waved at her son.

Out of nowhere, a surprised voice called out, "Amelia, it's you?! What are you doing here? You're still alive!"

Amelia's face stiffened as she turned to see a familiar face.

It was Chris's mother, Diana Martinez.

Amelia and Diana used to live together as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.


But their relationship was terrible.

It wasn't Amelia's fault; she was the one being mistreated by Diana.
Diana accused her of embezzling their money, not being able to win her husband's heart, and not having a child with Chris in three years of marriage.

If Diana hadn't followed her husband abroad, Amelia's life would have been even harder.

"Speak up, why are you here? You're not dead, why didn't you go back?"Diana pushed through the crowd, grabbed Amelia's arm, and glared at her coldly. "Answer me!"

"What are you doing, ma'am? This is not acceptable, please release her right now! Speak with words, not hands." Sophia quickly pushed her away and stood in front of Amelia.

Diana stared at Sophia, finding her familiar but couldn't recall where she had seen her.

At this moment, Leila came over, "Mrs. Spencer, I'm afraid that you recognized the wrong person. This is not Amelia Tudor; she is Bella White.Mr.Howard's girlfriend."

Diana frowned,looking Amelia up and down, incredulous, "How is that possible? She clearly is..."

"Ms. Ross, who is this lady?" Amelia finally spoke.

Diana probably just returned from abroad, so she didn't know what had happened.

"This is Mrs. Spencer, Chris's mother," Leila introduced.

"Mom, Ms. White." At this moment, Owen squeezed through the crowd.calling sweetly.
Sophia smiled and held Owen's hand, "Honey, let's go."

"Whose child is this?" Diana froze, staring at Owen intently,her eyes sharp.This child looks exactly the same as Chris did when he was little. Could it be...

Sophia shielded Owen, "He's my son, any problem?"

"You had himn with Chris?" Diana was' suspicious.

Sophia quickly stepped back, "Stop your imagination. I have nothing to do with Chris. don't overthink."

"What's going on?" Someone else arrived. It was Chris.

His appearance made many of the female parents' eyes light up, and some recognized him,immediately whispering.

"Chris, look, isn't this Amelia? How come you don't recognize her? She's your wife, and this child, he clearly..."

"Mom." Chris interrupted Diana, "She's not Amelia."


Chris's sharp, cold gaze swept over Amelia's expressionless face, and he said to Leila, "Let's go."

Leila's eyes flashed with joy, and she obediently held Chris's arm, "Sure."

"Mom, Dad is with that bad woman again." Owen muttered, "I don't want him anymore, never ever."

Amelia rubbed Owen's head, "Owen, I never wanted him. Isn't it nice for the three of us and Sophia to live together?"
###Chapter 73

Sophia nodded eagerly. "Yeah, I'll be happy with you! By the way, how far along are you now? I heard you're breaking up with Mr.Howard?"

Amelia shot her a look, signaling to keep quiet in front of Owen.

Then,avoiding Owen, she spilled everything to Sophia.

"So,you and Mr. Howard?" Sophia asked, worried.

Amelia rested herchin on her hand, looking a bit helpless, "What happens between us depends on Chris's reaction. We'll just take it one step at a time."


Meanwhile...

"Leila, tell me the truth. What's the deal with that woman? She looks exactly like Amelia, but you all denied it. What's really going on?" Diana asked urgently as soon as she got in the car.

Leila told the driver to start the car and glanced bitterly at Chris's Ferrari not far ahead.


Since that day, he seemed to have completely forgotten her presence,treating her like she was invisible.

Was it because she crossed a line? But he had confirmed he would marry her.


It was all because of that bitch Amelia!

"Mrs. Spencer, I have suspected that woman several times to be Amelia.but she won't admit it, and there's nothing we can do. I'm just worried she
has some plan to hurt Chris. Nevertheless, Chris is very concerned about her," Leila said cautiously, her voice full of helplessness.

Diana frowned. "Really? But what about the kid?"

"The kid is Sophia's son. Sophia was Amelia's best friend, and now she's friends with Bella, who looks like Amelia. It's quite a coincidence," Leila said in a suggestive tone.

Diana snorted, "There are no such coincidences. I think Amelia is up to something. Why doesn't Chris do something about her? What's he thinking?"

Leila was secretly pleased to hear this, "Mrs. Spencer, it's better to be careful. Chris is very attentive to her, and now she has Mr. Howard backing her. She's not easy to deal with."

"Shut up. I thought you were capable, but after all these years,you've made no progress. Let me tell you, if you can get pregnant with Chris's baby. I'll accept you as my daughter-in-law," Diana said coldly.

Her mind was now full of thoughts about children. The child she had just seen, who looked so much like Chris, had already occupied her mind and wouldn't go away.

Leila was thrilled but kept her excitement inside, looking at Diana obediently, "Thank you for your support, Mrs. Spencer."

On the weekend, Victor organized a family dinner to welcome Diana,and Amelia was also invited.


She attended with Lucius, as they hadn't officially broken up yet.

"Diana will probably probe you again," Lucius said, opening the car door
for Amelia.

She nodded, "I know, but I'm not afraid."

As expected, as soon as they appeared, all eyes were on them, especially Diana.

She looked at Amelia and Lucius holding hands and said meaningfully,"This Ms. White looks so much like the previous Amelia. Every time I see her. I think she's Amelia. I can hardly get usedI to it."

Amelia said nothing, following Lucius forward, greeting Diana politely,and then sitting on the nearby sofa.

Victor smiled and switched topics, then headed to the study with Lucius to talk business.

As soon as they left, Amelia was left unprotected in the living room.Not wanting to deal with the Spencer family relatives, she headed straight to the small garden outside for a walk.

Shortly thereafter, someone followed her out. Amelia recognized the footsteps and knew who it was.

"Where were you the night before last?" Leila demanded, standing in front of her. "If it weren't for someone telling me you had sex with Chris,I wouldn't have known how shameless you are!"

Amelia and Chris not only made love but also went to the hospital afterward, indicating how intense it was.

And now she had the nerve to act like she had no relationship with Chris,showing up with Lucius in front of everyone.
Amelia was nothing but a filthy, despicable whore. "You already know, so why ask?" Amelia didn't even look up, busy replying to a client's message on her phone, not wanting to waste time on such a boring person.

Leila was so angry she nearly fainted. "Shame on you! You fucking slut!"

"Anything else?" Amelia glanced at her indifferently. "By the way, in what capacity are you attending the Spencer family dinner? You and Chris haven't broken up yet? He betrayed you, and you decided to tolerate it?"

"Shut up. bitch!" Leila trembled with rage. "Why should I break up? I won't let you get away with this! Not only will I not break up with him, but I'll also marry him! As long as I'm accepted, you will always be a shameful,sneaky adulterer!"

Amelia shrugged. "Suit yourself."

Leila actually took action.

During dinner, she seized the moment to speak her mind. "Chris, yousaid you would give me an official engagement ceremony. I think next Saturday would be perfect. How about we schedule the ceremony for next Saturday?"

Her words made everyone at the table react differently.

Amelia continued eating her food calmly, as if she hadn't heard a thing.


But she could clearly feel a sharp, burning gaze fixed on her, as if trying to see through her.

"Chris,what do you think?" Victor put down his utensils and asked.

Chris nodded but didn't say much.
He was like one of those annoying bosses who never spoke directly,making everyone guess.

Victor glared at him. "Make it clear. What does nodding mnean?"

Chris finally put down his utensils.

"Tll listen to you." His words were ambiguous.

Victor seemed to hear a joke. "That's rare.Since when do you listen to me?



Amelia and Lucius acted as if nothing happened, with Lucius even giving Amelia a piece of braised beef. "This is delicious, you should have some."

"Look, there's another couple here, grandpa." Chris raised an eyebrow and glanced at Victor. "Lucius hasn't even gotten engaged. How can I have my engagement before his?"

"Stop changing the subject." Victor glared at him.

Chris didn't care, his cold gaze sliding to Amelia. "What do you think,Ms.White?"


"Amelia and I have been busy lately, so we don't have plans to get engaged for now," Lucius retorted.

"Really? I find that hard to believe." Chris's voice sounded again. "Could the recent rumors be true? Are you two breaking up?"
###Chapter 74

He'd always had this monotone, unreadable way of talking, keeping everyone at arm's length. But right now, there was a surprising hint of curiosity in his voice.

Amelia suddenly lost her appetite.

She gave him a smile that didn't reach her eyes."That's not true," Lucius said flatly. "Bella just got back and needs to focus on running the gallery.We're not thinking about marriage or kids right now. But you two,you're different."


As he spoke, his eyes flicked over to Diana.

"Indeed. Chris is reaching the age where he should be settling down and getting married ," Diana said in a dignified tone,glancing at Amelia and Lucius with a half-smile. "Lucius, since you've waited for Ms. White for so long, why not tie the knot soon? Your dad will be thrilled and won't have to wvorry about you all the time."

Victor immediately jumped in, waving his hand. "Since we're talking weddings,why don't both couples get engaged together? Wouldn't that be perfect?"

Amelia was stunned. How could Victor just casually decide on marriage like that?


"Sure, it would be my pleasure," Leila agreed with a smile.

But the other three main characters stayed silent.

Even Chris, who usually spoke his mind, kept quiet and loo
Lucius also turned to look at Amelia, seemingly seeking her opinion.

Noticing that Amelia wasn't going to react, Lucius had to step in. "Dad, we're not in a rush."

"I'm not in a rush either," Chris said right after Lucius, with a meaningful smile.

"Chris, what are you..." Lela's face fell, grabbing Chris's arm hastily.

Chris gave her a slight look. and Leila swallowed the rest of her words.

After the family dinner.

"You must have an incredible amount of endurance, sticking with someone who betrayed you," Chris cornered Amelia, away from the others.

He had dropped his earlier cold and noble act, now full of aggression.

Amelia nervously glanced around, relieved that no one else was in the garden under the night sky.

"Are you crazy?" Amelia lowered her voice and glared at him. "Aren't you afraid Mr. Victor Spencer will find out?"

Chris grabbed her shoulder maliciously, sneering, "Afraid? What do I have to be afraid of? At worst, I'll tell Grandpa that I can lower my standards for you."

"Shut up!" Amelia quickly covered his mouth, warning, "You shameless jerk, I still care about my reputation!"

Chris was simply mad. He was like a loose cannon, never following the rules.
"What reputation do you have left? You've done everything to get close to me. I admit, you're different from before. You better know when to stop, or.



"Or what?" Amelia looked impatient, "Do you think you're that popular?"

She looked him up and down with disdain, "How do you compare to Lucius?"

"You..." Chris was provoked, his gaze darkened, and he gripped Amelia's shoulder hard.

The last thing he wanted was to be compared to Lucius.

Amelia winced in pain but still looked at him calmly, as if saying, "Is this all you can do?"

"He betrayed you," Chris gritted his teeth, "Are you so pathetic that you can't live without him?”

"Then what can I do?" Amelia pushed him away forcefully, retreating to a safe distance, tears welling up in her eyes. "I can only rely on him. Who else would genuinely protect me besides him? Do you expect me to rely on you?"

"Why can't you rely on me? Whatever he can do, I can do too." Chris's face turned pale, realizing he had misspoken in his haste.

But Amelia still didn't give him a satisfactory answer.

That night, everyone was supposed to crash at The Spencer Mansion.

Amelia went back to her room, freshened up, and was surprised to find an unexpected visitor in her temporary bedroom.
It was Diana.

She and Leila really looked like mother and daughter, their demeanor and gestures seemed to be cut from the same cloth.

A few years ago, when Amelia was part of the Spencer family, Diana had publicly declared more than once that Amelia was just a gold digger who seduced Chris into marrying her. Not even the servants gave her any respect.

Most of the humiliation Amelia endured back then was thanks to Diana.

"Mrs. Spencer, what brings you here?" Seeing Diana, she didn't bother to get up.

"Do you have any manners? An elder comes to talk to you, and you don't even say a polite word?" Diana snorted, plopping down on the sofa.

Amelia quietly flipped through the book in her hand, not even lifting her eyelids. "Mrs. Spencer, you barged in without knocking. What kind of manners is that?"

"You really are a sharp-tongued girl, no wonder you have our Chris wrapped around your finger," Diana sneered, staring straight at Amelia. "Since you're Lucius' girlfriend, you should behave yourself. But you keep flirting with others, what are you up to?"

"Honestly, I'm aiming to be a wealthy wife. If I marry Mr. Howard or Chris one day, I can be as arrogant as you and mistreat others," Amelia still didn't look at Diana directly.

She was afraid that if she met Diana's eyes, those painful mnem resurface, revealing her inner resentment.
"I knew you had bad intentions! Get out of here immediately!" Diana totally lost her cool, pointing at her nose. "This is The Spencer Mansion,we can't tolerate a slut like you."

"Fine. I'll tell Mr. Victor Spencer that I'm leaving," Amelia said,putting down her book, clapping her hands as if dusting off nonexistent dirt, and grabbed her bag to leave.

Luckily, she hadn't changed into her pajamas yet. Otherwise,going to change clothes at a time like this would completely undermine her presence.

"Stop!" Diana's face changed again. "What are you going to tell him?"

If Amelia left now, wouldn't Victor come after her?

Amelia crossed her arms, looking helpless. "Just that you don't want me here,what else?"

Diana's wvell-maintained face showed anger and disbelief. At this moment.she suddenly believed that this person was not the old Amelia.

Amelia was weak and a pushover, while Bella was sharp-tongued and vengeful.

"Mrs. Spencer, your son isn't as popular as you think. Excuse me for not seeing you out, please leave," Amelia raised her eyebrows lightly,effortlessly driving her away.

Undoubtfully,she completely offended Diana that night.

The next morning, as soon as she got back to the gallery, she got a call from Chris,asking why she had pissed off Diana.
Amelia. of course. had no good attitude,recounting the conversation word for word. making Chris so angry that his voice changed.

After hanging up the phone, Amelia, Sophia, and Owen happily started having snacks.

She had specially placed a high-difficulty puzzle in her office that Owen liked, so he could stay occupied for at least an hour or two.

"Mom,when can we go back? I miss Olivia," Owen asked, showing Amelia the completed map puzzle, posing a question that was hard to answer.
###Chapter 75

Seeing Amelia's stiff expression, Sophia jumped in to help, "Don't worry, it Il be soon. You trust your mom,right?"

Owen nodded emphatically, totally convinced.

It wasn't until Owen got tired from playing and went to the lounge to sleep that Amelia started talking to Sophia about her current predicament.

She wanted to get what she needed and then slip away smoothly,making sure Chris had no more thoughts about her. Otherwise, the consequences would be dire.

But she was starting to feel like Chris's attitude towards her was changing.Even when she triedto push him away with harsh words, he still kept coming back.

He'd never been so lenient with anyone else. In all of Pinecrest, if anyone dared to treat him like that, they'd probably be gone by the next day.

"You're in a tough spot. Playing hard to get was supposed to lure him in so you could get his sperm, but now he's more interested in you. You're stuck," Sophia sighed deeply.

Amelia stayed quiet.

Sophia went on, "You need to focus on one thing at a time. Get the sperm first, then deal with everything else later. He didn't know where you were for years, and you can go back to your old place afterward. I doubt he'll find you that easily."

"You're right," Amelia said after a pause, with a helpless smile. "Someone like him can't be handled according to the original plan. Getting hi
is already a big win. How could I cover all bases?"

'Forget it,' she thought, deciding to use some more tactics.

For several days, the news of Lucius and Chloe being inseparable spread throughout the circle.

Chris, however, didn't call again, as if waiting to see how long she could hold out.


Amelia stayed calm, working out daily to keep her body in shape and monitoring her ovulation, just waiting for the right moment to achieve her goal.

But she didn't expect an unexpected visitor that night.

"Bella, right? I've heard a lot about you." When the sales associate Wendy Brown brought the young lady over, Amelia was washing her brushes, and the mirror reflected a bright and elegant face.

She shook off the paintbrush, guessing who the visitor was.

"Ms. Wilson is also well-known," she said calmly, turning around.

At this moment, she casually tied her hair up, still wearing an apron,and her hands were not yet clean, covered in oil paint.

She indeed couldn't compare to Chloe's meticulous elegance from head to toe.


But when she smiled faintly, her face, and even her whole being,instantly became vibrant.


Her beauty was from the inside out, with a unique charm, beautiful but not vulgar, like a refreshing breeze.
Chloe frowned immediately, not daring to act rashly.

"You're Lucius's girlfriend? Oh, just a normal person. Besides painting,what else can you do? Can you help him?" she said.

Amelia was momentarily speechless.

After a moment of silence, she shook her head, "I can't help him with anything, and I am indeed ashamed of that."

Chloe raised an eyebrow and smiled, feeling smug, "But I can help him."

"So?" Amelia remained composed, "Ms. Wilson, are you here to steal my boyfriend?"

Chloe was taken aback, seemingly not expecting her to be so direct.

"What I mean is, you're not worthy of Lucius. You'd better back out voluntarily," she said coldly, "Love is about helping him achieve happiness,isn't it? He's met someone better now, someone who can help him more.You should let him go."

Amelia was about to speak when her phone suddenly beeped.

Wendy texted her, saying Chris had arrived.

Amelia calmly put down her phone, her gaze turning cold, and her demeanor becoming icy. She looked up at Chloe and said, "Are all rich girls as arrogant and ill-mannered as you?"

Her voice was low, just enough for the two of them to hear.

Chloe, who had been pampered since childhood, had never heard such sharp sarcasm. She was immediately furious, "I'm ill-mannered? Are you well-mannered for stealing someone else's boyfriend? I was planning to
talk to you nicely, but you..."

"Who do you think you are, to be so arrogant in front of me?" Amelia interrupted with a sardonic grin, blatantly mocking her.

Chloe was astounded, entirely unprepared for what had just happened.She had never been subjected to such humiliation before.


"People said you were cunning, but I didn't believe it and even had good intentions towards you. Now I see you are as despicable as the rumors say,you wretch." She suddenly stepped forward, grabbing a folder from the table and hitting Amelia with it.

Suddenly, a thick piece of paper inside the folder flew out, slashing across Amelia's cheek and leaving a bloody mark.

Amelia felt a sharp pain on her face. Touching it, she found her hand covered in blood.


She screamed in panic, "Wendy, Wendy!"

Wendy was an assistantLucius had hired for Amelia, skilled in both literature and martial arts.


Usually, whenever Amelia called, she would come running immediately,but there was no movement outside the door this time.


Chloe was also stunned by the scene, looking at her hand in disbelief, the folder still in her hand. How could Bella be injured?

"You two-faced bitch, why are you pretending? I didn't even touch you!"She stepped forward and grabbed Amelia's shoulder, pulling her up, only to see that the side of Amelia's face she was clutching was bleeding profusely.
Chloe trembling with fear. stepped back, her face pale."How could this happen?"

She had only one thought in her mind:Leave here now.

"It wasn't me. I didn't do it, it wvas your own carelessness!" She said in a panicked voice,turning and running away.

"Wendy," Amelia's voice was filled with despair as she looked towards the door.

At that moment, the door was pushed open, and a tall, slender figure walked in.


Their eyes met, and Chris was immediately shocked,quickly walking over,"What happened to your face?"


Amelia, with tears streaming down her face, hesitated to treat the wound,fearing it would worsen, and said to him, "Mr. Spencer, can you help me find a doctor? My face was cut by her."


Although it was more outrageous than she had expected,it was still within her control.

Chris looked at her tearful eyes with a complex expression, then stepped forward to help her up, "I'll take you to the hospital."

His voice was deep, tinged with worry.

Amelia's hands were covered in blood, and she was trembling with fear,her face pale.

Chris keptglancing back at her while driving, seeing her trembling shoulders and anxious face, feeling a heavy discomfort in his chest.
They soon arrived at the hospital.

The doctor examined her, and fortunately, the wound was not serious and didn't require stitches because they went to the doctor in time, but it needed medication and proper care, avoiding exposure to water.

"Doctor, will it leave a scar? I'm afraid my boyfriend will be angry,"Amelia asked, looking up.

Before the doctor could respond, Chris was furious and said, "You're still thinking about him at a time like this?"

Unknowingly, his emotions had been stirred.

Amelia wiped away her tears, "Then who else should I think about?You?Not a chance."

Chris's face immediately turned ashen. 'Fine, if you're so foolish and unaware, don't blame me for making decisions for you.'
###Chapter 76

After getting her wound patched up. Chris took Amelia back to the gallery.She pulled out her phone, hesitated for what felt like forever, but just couldn't bring herself to call Lucius.

Chris stood off to the side, smirking. "Not feeling confident about your relationship at all?"

Amelia, too drained to even glareat him, choked up, "Not really. I don't have confidence in myself."

Chris got it immediately. Lucius and Amelia were in completely different leagues now.

One was the heir to a prestigious family, the other was a woman barely scraping by, relying on his protection and being used by him.

Without Lucius, how would she even survive?

"Scared you can't live without him?" Chris's voice was dripping with irritation. "Weren't you trying to seduce me? Well, congrats,you made it.Now stop pretending!"

He was pissed, his patience was wearing thin.

If she kept up this act,he wouldn't stand for it.

"I don't have time to argue with you today." Amelia stared at her reflection in the mirror,looking frazzled and anxious.

She seemed to be ignoring Chris completely.

Chris noticed and let outa cold laugh, "Do you think he'd choose you over
Chloe?"

Amelia stiffened, turning to glare at him with resentment. "Why are you so vicious? What did I ever do to you to make you cling to me like this?"

Her words cut deep, like a knife to his chest.

Chris felt a surge of frustration and turned away to avoid her angry gaze.

"You know he doesn't care about you,'yet you still..."

"What does it matter to you?" Amelia snapped back.

Chris was instantly enraged, "Then call him now and see if he even picks up!"


By now, Chloe had probably already gone to Lucius to complain about Amelia.


"Fine, I will!" Provoked, Amelia dialed his number.

She called Lucius three times but got no answer.

The light in Amelia's eyes started to fade.

But then, a mninute later, he called her back.


Amelia answered excitedly, just about to speak, when Lucius's cold voice came through, "Bella, how could you speak to Ms. Wilson like that? You were too rude, you need to apologize to her!"

Amelia's face went pale, the words she wanted to say stuck in her throat.

"Did you hear me?" Lucius added, "Behave yourself!"

"Why should I apologize? She came to humiliate me." Amelia tried to keep
her emotions in check, speaking slowly.

On the other end, she could hear Chloe's tearful sobs, with Lucius occasionally comforting her in a low voice.

For a long time, Lucius didn't respond.

"Looks like you've been ditched," Chris threw in another jab.

Amelia's anger flared up. Gritting her teeth, she said to Lucius, "Lucius, I'm breaking up with you. From now on,we're done!"

She hung up and turned off her phone immediately.

Chris crossed his arms, a satisfied smile on his face.

Amelia noticed and glared at him coldly, "Happy now?"

Chris raised an eyebrow and grinned, "Absolutely."

They finally broke up.

But he was also kicked oet of the gallery. 'Doesn't mnatter,' Chris thought,as long as I'm around, there's no way you two are getting back together.'

Amelia was left alone in the gallery.

She took a moment to gather herself, poured a glass of water, and sipped it slowly.


Her mind was racing. She'd already hit most of her targets. Now, she just needed to keep stringing Chris along without actually giving in, but she had to speed things up.

The news of the breakup quickly became known to everyone in the circle.
Rumor had it they had a massive blowout, and Amelia, unable to take the humiliation, ultimately chose to step out of the love triangle and vowed never to reconcile.

It was known to all that Chris was behind it.

"That Bella chick? Mr. Howard is far too good for her. Just a normal painter."

"Without Mr.Howard, who is she? Offending him was a huge mistake. She's way out of her league."

"Seriously, I've never seen someone mess up their own life like that.Giving up a solid backer? She's nuts."

These rumors made Amelia too scared to even think about reconciling with Lucius.


Otherwise, she'd be the laughingstock of the whole circle.

Meanwhile, Chloe was getting closer to Lucius every day, sticking to him like glue. As their companies' partnership grew, Lucius was raking it in.He not only solidified his top spot in the group, overshadowing Chris for a while, but also scored a five percent share from Victor.

Everyone knew shares in the Spencer Group were gold. Even 0.1 percent was a big deal, let alone five percent.

Chris only had thirty percent, some of which he inherited from his dad.and he'd busted his ass for years to get it.

Now,Lucius had twenty-five percent, almost catching up to Chris.

Leila, hearing all this, was both anxious and pissed, blaming Amelia for
not winning Lucius over, and worried that without that tie, she'd go after Chris even harder.

Meanwhile.Amelia was chilling at home, enjqying a hot pot.

Her plan was moving along nicely. Soon, everyone would make their moves, and she needed to rest up to face it all.

"Mom. don't sneak in any chili," Owen warned seriously. "Your wound means no spicy food. You have to be careful."

Amelia looked at the bland veggies in front of her, feeling a bit down.

"Tll just add a little, it won't hurt," she said wvith a smile.

Owen shook his head firmly, "No, you promised me and Sophia."

Sophia came out of the kitchen with some tomato sauce, "Here, try this. It's got flavor."

Amelia perked up, "Thanks."

Only with Sophia and Owen could she forget everything else and find a bit of happiness.

After dinner, the three of them held hands and walked by the small lake nearby.


Sophia asked worriedly, "Leaving Mr. Howard's protection will make things tough for you."


"That's the plan. Otherwise, how would Chris step in to protect me?"Amelia smiled faintly. "We were married for a few years, I know him well.He probably wants to play hard to get, waiting for me to come
Sophia sighed, "Once people have money, they get bored and come up with these games for fun."

Amelia laughed, "Just wish me luck."
###Chapter 77

Amelia's guess was way off.

As things between her and Lucius kept getting 'worse', word spread in their social circle, and people started taking shots at her.

At first, some folks would just pop into the gallery to insult the staff or to provoke Amelia in various ways, calling her a pathetic homewrecker who was unwanted and unloved.


Amelia was unbothered and didn't let it get to her. But as the attacks got louder, the media jumped in, stirring up trouble and painting her in a bad light.

"Did you hear? This Bella chick is actually Amelia, the same Amelia her mom sold off for a good price."

"Holly shit! It confirms my suspicion that she is similar to Amelia. Maybe Lucius found out and that's why he dumped her."

"I heard her paintings are rip-offs too."

Amelia could handle the usual gossip. But one day, a somewhat famous painter accused her of plagiarism.


Amelia was dealing with some difficult customers when Irene Thomas barged in with her crew and ordered her bodyguards, "Smash all these paintings!"

Amelia felta chill run down her spine. She couldn't imagine that these people were incredibly mean.

It was clear they wanted to kick her while she was down.
"What are you doing? Stop!" Wendy stepped up to confront them.Worried for her safety, Amelia quickly pulled her back.

Irene glared at Amelia, "Bella, right? A painter? With this crap? You even have the audacity to run a gallery and sell your junk at outrageous prices?Shame on you!"


"I know you were sent by Leila," Amelia said calmly. "Should I remind you that this is illegal?"

Amelia's face was still healing, the bandages off but the bloodstains visible.

She knew Irene, who was obsessed with painting to the point of madness.Irene thought her work was the only real art, and everyone else's in Pinecrest was trash.


Irene had shown up with Leila a few timnes before.

Irene's face tightened, but she kept glaring, "Your painting 'Sunflowers' is a blatant copy of mine. You owe me an explanation!"


By now, Irene's crew had trashed most of the gallery, turning tables and chairs into rubble.


"Call the cops," Amelia said to her assistant firmly.

Just then, a guy in black stepped up and snatched Wendy's phone.


"Call the cops? Do you know who I am?" Irene sneered, mockery in her eyes.


"Yeah, you're from the Thomas family. You studied impressionist painting abroad and opened an art gallery, but it's not doing so hot," Amelia said clinically, not fazed by the chaos.
Irene's face turned blue with anger, "You, who'll do anything dirty for fame, don't deserve to stay in Pinecrest. Get the fuck out of here as soon as you can!"

So, Irene wanted to drive her out completely.

"Why doesn't Leila show up herself? Is she so scared I'll hurt her?"Amelia changed the subject, giving Irene a half-smile.

The vibe got a bit awkward.


"Don't stop, smash everything!" Irene, her face red with rage, yanked down several paintings and slashed them with a knife.


"What should we do?" Wendy was on the verge of tears,totally freaking out.


By the time the cops showed up, Irene and her crew had already bailed.Before leaving, they warned that if Amelia reopened the gallery,they'd come back and wreck everything again.

But with the store's surveillance trashed and not many witnesses around,Amelia, Wendy,and the other employees' statements weren't enough for the police to nab Irene.


Instead, the whole thing spread like wildfire, and Amelia got mocked even more.


Everyone was betting on how long she could hold out.

That night, Leila showed up at the gallery.

Amelia was directing workers to fix the damaged walls when she noticed a stunning figure walk in. She turned her head instinctively.
Their eyes met, and Leila smirked, "Busy, huh? Not scared they'll tear it down again?"

Amelia dusted off her hands, "What do you want? Just spit it out."

"I'm here to commission a painting. Despite your rep going down the drain, the fact that I still remember you is quite a favor." Leila plopped down on the sofa, looking smug.

Amelia waved the workers away and sat down too.

"You sent those people, didn't you?" She said in confidence.

Leila raised an eyebrow and smiled, "You know, that's slander."

She'd heard that despite Amelia's recent troubles, she hadn't broken down.Seeing her now, it was true.

But she came today to see Amelia's despair and anger firsthand.

"Ms. Ross, you play dirty." Amelia stood up, poured herself a glass of water, and took a sip. "Without lifting a finger, you managed to crush me."

The corner of Leila's mouth ticked higher, almost unable to suppress her laughter.

Suddenly, Amelia splashed the water in her face.

Leila was stunned.

"What the hell are you doing, you..." Before she could finish, Amelia lunged and grabbed her by the throat, teeth gritted, "You dare to do it but won't admit it? It was you. You are so vindictive that you won't be satisfied until you've destroyed me."
Leila's face went pale. She tried to struggle, but Amelia's grip was like iron.

Leila struggled, staring at Amelia,"Are you looking for death?"

Amelia sneered. "You pushed me!"


Suddenly. Leila kicked Amelia in the stomach, making her stumble back,almost hitting the table.


"Yeah, it was me. Irene's my friend. I'just said a few words, and she did it for me. Do you think I'd waste my time on a bitch like you?"

A bruise formed on Leila's neck, but in her thrill and rage, she became hysterical.

"I knew it." Amelia smiled slightly and slapped her.

Leila lost it and lunged at Amelia, but Wendy and the security guards arrived just in time to stop her and kick her out.

That night,Amelia went to find Chris.


"What do you want? Can't handle it anymore, so you came to me?" Chris lounged lazily on the semicircular sofa in the club, his sharp features looking especially striking under the flickering lights.
###Chapter 78

"Your fiancée trashed my gallery, and I think you owe me an explanation," Amelia said coldly, playing a recorded clip of the destruction.
Chris narrowed his eyes, his expression unreadable. "Ms. White, you're being unreasonable," he said, looking at Amelia's pale, trembling face. "She's my fiancée. If I don't protect her, who should I protect? You? Who are you to me?"
His look seemed to imply that if she were with him, he would have a reason to stand by her side. Amelia studied him for a long time with a complicated expression, then suddenly turned and walked away quickly.
Shocked, Chris immediately stood up and reached out to grab her arm to stop her. Without hesitation, Amelia turned and struck him across the face. The sound was so loud that it drew the attention of everyone in the clubhouse.
"You're testing my patience!" Chris roared, his grip on her wrist tightening with enough force to make her wince.
"I just wanted to see how low you people can go," Amelia replied, her voice shaking with adrenaline. "I'm going through a difficult time, and everyone pounces on me like hyenas, waiting to see me humiliated. And you? You're the worst. Leila and the others at least confront me openly. You don't even have the guts to show your face. You're just hiding here, watching me get bullied."
Her voice grew urgent, and her eyes turned red with unshed tears. Chris was stunned by this side of her, remaining silent for a long time.
Amelia, still not satisfied, vented her anger at him. "You think I'll give in? That I'll buckle under the pressure and come running to you for help? Dream on! Even if I'm pushed to the edge, I will never bow to someone as heartless as you!"
"Enough!" Chris finally snapped, gripping her shoulders to steady her. At that moment, he began to doubt his long-held conclusions. Either this wasn't the Amelia he knew at all, or she had shattered and rebuilt herself with fierce, unyielding determination.
Whatever her intentions were in approaching him, she had succeeded. She had piqued his curiosity and his competitive spirit.
"Don't touch me!" Amelia angrily pushed him away. She used so much force that she stumbled back a few steps, almost losing her balance. Despite her disheveled state, she looked like a brave warrior, unafraid of anything.
In the instant she stumbled, Chris instinctively reached out to catch her. In his deep eyes, his irritation transformed into an overwhelming sense of heartache.
"What's going on? She actually dared to yell at Mr. Spencer," the onlookers whispered among themselves. "She seems to be at a breaking point. I heard her gallery was destroyed and her reputation has plummeted."
The voices, relentless and judgmental, felt like sharp arrows piercing Amelia's heart. She hadn't cared before, but now, the dam broke. She began to weep, exposing her vulnerability for the first time.
"Get out!" Chris suddenly roared, turning his fury on the crowd. "Everyone get out! If anyone dares to mock her again, they'll find themselves barred from every establishment in Pinecrest!"
In an instant, the voices ceased. After a terrifying silence, the crowd fled, afraid of his wrath. The large clubhouse emptied out in no time. Amelia, looking completely drained, collapsed toward the floor. Chris rushed over to help her, realizing as he touched her skin that she was burning up.
"You have a fever. We need to get you to the hospital."
"No, don't touch me," Amelia glared at him, trying to push him away, but she was too weak. Her tears fell even harder. "Home. I just want to go home."
Her voice was fragile and broken. No matter how strong-willed Chris usually was, at this moment, he could only follow her wishes.
It was his first time stepping into Amelia's place. It was a small, cozy villa, tastefully decorated but feeling somewhat empty.
"Do you have any fever medicine?" Chris asked.
Amelia weakly pointed under the coffee table. "Medical kit... there."
Chris quickly found it and poured her a glass of water, his actions surprisingly considerate. As she took the medicine, he suddenly said, "Be with me, and I'll protect you."
His words were blunt and straightforward. Amelia coughed violently, almost choking. He quickly patted her back, gritting his teeth. "Why are you so stubborn? You're always opposing me. It's no wonder you end up in these situations."
"I don't want to be a side-piece, nor do I want to be a target for those women," Amelia finally calmed down, giving him a faint glance. "Don't waste your time on me."
Chris immediately grew defensive. "I could have anyone I want!"
"Then go ahead. Don't be an eyesore in my house," Amelia's voice was flat, but her indifferent tone drove him mad.
"Amelia, don't be ungrateful," Chris said coldly. "Others would beg for this kind of attention."
"I don't want to be an outsider in your life," Amelia said.
"You wouldn't be an outsider, okay? Be my girlfriend!" Chris put his hands on his hips, pacing in front of her for three circles before finally confessing, "Leila and I are no longer together. She's not my fiancée, it's just because—"
Before he could finish, his phone rang. Annoyed, he saw it was Leila. He hung up, but she called back repeatedly. Irritated, he finally answered. "What is it?"
"Chris, I had a car accident. Come help me," Leila's tearful voice came through. "I'm so scared. I'm bleeding, and the other driver is being aggressive."
Chris's expression changed instantly, his eyes instinctively darting to Amelia. A cold, mocking look flashed in her eyes.
"Go ahead," she sneered. "Don't keep your Leila waiting."
She felt a bitter sense of validation. Indeed, Leila was still his priority. Fortunately, she hadn't been swayed by his words moments ago.
"I'll go handle this. Wait for me here, I'll be back soon," Chris said, his demeanor restless.
Amelia's eyes showed no emotion. "This is my home. I won't be waiting for you."
Chris's gaze became complicated. After a few seconds of silence, he abruptly stood up and left. The door closed with a heavy thud, leaving the entire villa in silence.

###Chapter 79
Chris tore down the road, his mind a chaotic whirl of memories. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Amelia—always guarded, always resisting him. He felt a desperate urge to understand why she had such a hold on him, wondering if he had ever truly moved on.
When he arrived at the scene of Leila’s accident, his anxiety turned to irritation. It wasn't the catastrophe she’d described; it was a minor fender bender with a faint scratch on the bumper. Leila stood by the car, looking perfectly fine despite her frantic calls.
"Chris! You’re here!" Leila ran toward him, looking for the comfort of a savior. "That woman was reckless! My knee—I think I’m injured."
Chris glanced at her leg. There wasn't even a bruise. "I’m sure you’ll survive the walk to the car, Leila. The wound will be a memory before we even find a doctor."
Leila froze, tears beginning to well in her eyes. "It hurts, Chris. And I have a performance in two days. This stress... it’s too much."
Her voice was soft and pleading, but Chris felt nothing. He found himself comparing her to Amelia—Amelia, whose anger was a wildfire, but whose tears were silent and rare. He realized with a jolt of clarity that he was drawn to the fire, not the performance.
"Chris, stay with me?" Leila clung to his arm. "I’m shaken up. Or come home with me, just for a little while? I feel like I haven't seen you in weeks."
Chris remained silent, his silence growing heavier by the second.
"I’ve waited so long," Leila sobbed, her composure finally breaking. "I don't ask for much. Just a meal, a walk... a moment where I’m not being ignored. I proposed to you, and you said 'not now.' But when is 'now'? Just give me something to hold onto."
Chris felt a wave of guilt, but it wasn't enough to override his resolve. "We can't get married, Leila," he said, his voice firm and final. "I’ll ensure you’re taken care of, but the engagement... it ends today. You can no longer use my name as your shield."
Leila went pale, her face contorting in shock. "What? Because of her? Because of Amelia?"
When he didn't deny it, a sharp, bitter pain flared in her chest. "I knew it," she whispered. "I’ve tried for years to build a place for myself, and she destroys it without even trying. Chris, please. Don't leave me. I’ll do anything. I won't even ask you to stop seeing her. Just give me the title of your wife. Let me keep my dignity in public, and I’ll never pester you again. I swear it."
Chris frowned. "You’d trade your life for a hollow title?"
"If it means I don't lose everything, yes," she pleaded.

Two hours later, Chris returned to Amelia’s villa. To his surprise, the front door was ajar. He quickened his pace, sensing trouble.
Inside, a woman named Sable was standing over Amelia, who looked exhausted on the sofa.
"Ms. White, Lucius has searched for you for years," Sable was saying, her tone a mix of pleading and pressure. "Everything he does, he does for you. Once he recovers the assets Chris took, he’ll be able to give you the life you deserve."
"Tell him I don't care about the assets or the life he’s planned," Amelia replied, her voice hoarse.
"Don't be ungrateful!" Sable’s voice rose as she heard Chris’s footsteps behind her. She quickly pivoted her tone to sound more aggressive. "Mr. Howard saved you when you were nothing. You owe him everything! Don't bring trouble on yourself by associating with the wrong people."
"And who decided Lucius was the 'right' person?" Chris walked in, his presence immediately cooling the room. He looked every bit the arrogant CEO, distant and untouchable.
Sable gasped. "Mr. Spencer... I didn't realize you were here."
"Leave," Amelia commanded, her eyes cold. "Go back and tell Lucius there is no future for us. Not in this lifetime."
"You don't mean that," Sable insisted. "He’ll be furious. You know what he’s capable of when he’s crossed..."
In a sudden move that shocked both Chris and Sable, Amelia stood up. She stepped directly into Chris’s personal space, grabbing his lapels and pulling him down toward her. It wasn't a gentle embrace; it was a declaration of war. She leaned in, her lips brushing his in a brief, possessive gesture that looked like a deep kiss to anyone watching from behind.
"Are you satisfied now?" Amelia snapped, pushing Chris back and turning to Sable with a look of pure defiance. "I’ve chosen. I’m with Chris now. Tell Lucius to stay away."
Terrified by the sudden escalation, Sable scrambled out of the villa.
As soon as the door clicked shut, Amelia collapsed back onto the sofa, her strength spent. "I’m sorry," she whispered, not looking at him. "I needed a way to end his hope. I used you. You can leave now."
Chris stood there, the ghost of her touch still lingering. "You used me... and now you’re throwing me out?"
Amelia closed her eyes. "Goodbye, Chris."

###Chapter 80
Chris let out a sharp, incredulous laugh. "Using me as a tool? You really think it’s that easy to shake me off?" He sat down, his gaze fixed on her with a persistence that Amelia found increasingly hard to ignore.
"So? What’s your point?" she asked, her voice tight.
"My offer still stands," Chris said, his tone dropping to a serious, resonant level. "The situation with Lucius is escalating. You’ve crossed a line with him, and he isn't a man who overlooks betrayal. Stay with me, and I’ll ensure no one touches you."
"I’m not interested in your protection," Amelia replied, though she sank back into the sofa, looking utterly drained.
Chris stood up and stepped toward her, his presence closing the distance between them until the air felt thin. "Well, I’m interested in you. And right now, that’s what matters."
"You’re relentless," Amelia muttered, her eyes flashing with a mix of exhaustion and a bitter, lingering spark of something she couldn't quite name.
He reached out, his hand resting briefly on her forehead. "Your fever has broken. You’re stronger than you look, but you’re still pushing yourself too hard."
The atmosphere in the room shifted, the lingering resentment between them transforming into a heavy, undeniable tension. Chris leaned in, his shadow enveloping her. Amelia tried to maintain her wall of coldness, but as he closed the gap, her resolve began to waver.
The bedroom was soon swathed in a quiet, amber light as the evening faded. Outside the world continued its frantic pace, but inside, time seemed to slow down. In the silence, the boundaries they had both fought so hard to maintain began to blur, replaced by a deep, wordless connection that had been years in the making.

By the next morning, Amelia felt a renewed strength. Sunlight filtered through the curtains, illuminating the room in a soft, golden glow.
She turned her head to find Chris lying beside her. Even in sleep, his arm was draped over her, a possessive but surprisingly gentle weight. In the quiet of the morning, his features looked less like those of the arrogant CEO she fought with and more like the man she had once known. His breathing was steady, his expression peaceful.
She remembered the intensity of the previous night—the way his usual coldness had melted into something far more vulnerable. A strange, bittersweet feeling took root in her heart. She was playing a dangerous game, weaving her life back into his for the sake of her own goals, yet the lines between her plan and her feelings were becoming increasingly tangled.
As Chris stirred, Amelia tried to quietly slip away, but his grip tightened, pulling her back into the warmth of the sheets.
"Awake already?" Chris’s voice was a low, sleep-roughened murmur that sent a reluctant shiver through her.
Amelia forced her voice to remain steady. "It’s late. You should go. I have a schedule to keep, and you don’t belong here."
Chris’s eyes snapped open, a flash of his usual sharp wit returning. "What, you’re evicting me already? I didn't realize you were so focused on the bottom line, Ms. White."
Amelia didn't argue about her identity. "I just don't like lingering over mistakes. Yesterday was a compromise, nothing more."
Chris propped himself up on one elbow, his eyes narrowing. "A mistake? You certainly didn't seem to think so a few hours ago."
"You were too forceful," Amelia lied, her eyes flickering with a faint, mocking disdain. "It wasn't exactly the masterpiece I expected."
Chris gritted his teeth, his pride clearly stung. For a man who was used to getting whatever he wanted, Amelia’s indifference was the ultimate provocation. "Is that so? Perhaps I need to provide a more convincing demonstration."
He pulled her back down, and the morning air was soon filled with the sounds of their renewed argument—a clash of wills that felt more like an embrace.

Meanwhile, at the international kindergarten, Sophia arrived to pick up Owen. To her unease, Diana Spencer was waiting near the gates again. Diana’s eyes were fixed on Owen, her brow furrowed in deep thought.
"Owen!" Diana called out softly as they approached.
Sophia tightened her grip on Owen’s hand, her instinct to protect him flaring. "Mrs. Spencer, is there something you need?"
Diana ignored Sophia, crouching down to Owen’s level. "Hello, Owen. You look very handsome today. Tell me, do you think I’m a nice person?"
Owen gave her a thoughtful, suspicious look before glancing at Sophia. "Mom, why is this lady asking for my approval? She’s clearly very elegant. Does she not have enough friends?"
Sophia managed a small, polite smile. "She’s just being friendly, Owen. But we shouldn't keep her waiting."
"I wasn't being rude," Owen added, looking back at Diana. "I just think honesty is better than empty compliments."
Diana laughed, a genuine sound of delight. "You really are a remarkable child. Tell me, what do you like to do for fun? Do you like robots? Legos?"
Owen answered her questions with a practiced, charming fluency, his little mind racing. She’s my grandmother, he realized, but she’s also part of the family that hurt Mom. "I like building things with my mom," Owen said firmly. "And I like going home to eat the dinner she’s made. We have to go now, Mrs. Spencer. Goodbye."
Watching them walk away, Diana’s heart felt heavy. The boy was so much like Chris at that age—the same intelligence, the same stubborn streak.
The next morning, Owen arrived at the kindergarten to find the atmosphere changed. Raymond, his classmate, pulled him aside with wide eyes. "Owen, look! There are men in black suits in the principal's office. My dad says they’re from a big company."
Owen looked toward the office, his expression turning cold and focused. He knew those suits. The hunt was getting closer.

###Chapter 81

He kept a low profile, always watching his back.

Later, someone started tailing him, trying to yank his hair. Owen smartly figured out they were after his DNA to run a paternity test with his shitty dad.


No way was he letting that happen.

A few days later. Diana got the results. Even though she had a hunch.about the outcome, seeing it in black and white still stung. Owen was the spitting image of Chris as a kid; how could he not be Chris's son? Despite the disappointment, she had to face the facts.

Diana thought about Leila. Chris had been flying solo for years, bout he still looked out for Leila, the only one who could get close to him.

Diana had no clue how things were going between Leila and Chris.

She went to find Leila, but neither of them had any idea where Chris was.

He'd taken off right after work, and no one knew where he went.

Leila suggested, "Maybe he's out drinking for work stuff. We could follow him and try to get him to take better care of himself."

Diana nodded.

They waited in the garage for half an hour before they saw Chris come down to get his car and tailed him.

Chris drove out to a villa in the suburbs, which was a surprise to Diana and Leila.
"Did he buy a place here? How did I not know?" Diana peered at the villa gates through the car window, feeling suspicious.

Leila stayed cool, "I have no clue either. He must be staying here lately.Why don't we grab some stuff to bring over? If he's living here, he'll need food and drinks."


Diana gave her an approving look and agreed.

They went shopping for a bunch of groceries and headed to the first villa near the gate. They saw Chris go into that villa.

Leila rang the doorbell.

Amelia, who was working in the living room, heard the bell and asked the maid to get the door.

"Chris, you..." Diana was stunned when she saw Amelia in the living room.

The groceries slipped from her hands.

Leila was just as shocked, "Ms. White, what are you doing here?"

Were they already living together?

"You shameless woman, what are you doing in my son's house? Get out now!" Diana was fuming, yelling at Amelia without holding back.

Amelia barely looked up, "Sorry, this is my house. You two need to leave."

Just then, Chris walked out of the kitchen, holding a bowl of sweet soup the maid had made.

"Why are you here?" He frowned at Leila and Diana, clearly annoyed.
Diana lost it and scolded, "You must be out of your mind. There are so many women for you to pick, and you choose to steal your uncle's girlfriend. You two have always been at odds, and now you're giving him a reason to report you to your grandpa. Do 'you know how much of your assets will be divided because of this? She's a bitch who brings trouble to you. She made you a laughingstock before, and now she's back to seduce you again with another look and identity. Only an idiot like you would fall for her tricks over and over!"

"It has nothing to do with her," Chris said coldly. "You two, get out."

This time, it was he who walked towards her.

"No way!" Diana glared at Amelia and then turned her anger on Chris,"Unless you come with me."

"Mrs. Spencer, let's go. Chris has his own plans," Leila suggested weakly.

Diana turned on her too, "You're useless. You've been with him for years and still haven't gotten pregnant. If you had any sense and capability,he wouldn't be tempted by this shameless tramp."

Upon hearing the blame, Leila's eyes welled up with tears as she looked at Chris, silently pleading for him to come back with them.

"I said, you two leave," Chris's patience was wearing thin, his voice icy.

The tension in the living room was palpable.

"I also said, you come with me. What's so great about this bitch? Should I remind you once again? She is your uncle's girlfriend! If your grandfather finds out, you'll be in big trouble!"

Diana was extremely urgent that she wished she could drag her insane son
away herself.

"She was mine first," Chris said coldly. "Lucius was in the wrong. Even if we argue in front of Grandpa, he has no case."

Diana and Leila were startled. Did he just admit that Bella was Amelia?That was even worse.


"You nuts. What did Bella do to you to make you ignore your own mother?" Diana gritted her teeth.


"It's none of your business," Chris said, stepping forward, his strong presence forcing Diana and Leia to back off. Realizing they had no choice,Diana and Leila sheepishly turned and left.

Amelia kept focusing on her work during their argument, her expression indifferent, as if she didn't take them seriously at all.

"Don't mind them," Chris returned and said, sitting down in front of her.his long limbs awkwardly positioned.

Amelia looked up, "I never gave them much thought. Dealing with them is your job."

Chris took a deep breath, his gaze darkening, "You are so heartless.What do you take me for?"

She didn't care about him, which made him deeply unhappy.

Amelia picked up her laptop and placed it on her lap, "A sex partner."

"You..." Chris stood up abruptly, furious,"What do you mean?"

Amelia looked at him with displeasure, "First, Mr. Spencer,can you stop being so emotiona1? I'm tired of your drama. Secondly, we are just in that
kind of relationship. Do you expect me to pay you for the sex? Your services aren't worth much."

Chris's eyes narrowed, a flash of anger crossing them.

But instead of getting angry, he laughed.

"Fine, you're right." He stepped forward and picked her up, "Since we're just sex partners, I don't need to be gentle with you."

"Let go of me!" Amelia frowned.

They had been making love many times in the past few days, and she thought it was enough to get pregnant. She didn't want to do it again.

"No." Chris's eyes flashed with a hint of revenge, "Unless you satisfy me."

Another round of intense sex.

Amelia was so exhausted that she couldn't straighten her back, curled up on the bed to rest.


He, on the other hand, was in a good mood, sitting by the large floor-to-ceiling window in her bedroom, admiring the view.


"Have you figured it out now? What am I to you?" He got up and sat on the edge of the bed, pulling her into his arms.


Amelia was too weak to move, glaring at him angrily.

Chris was amused by her pufferfish-like expression and couldn't help but laugh.

"Say it, what am I to you?" He pinched her chin, a wicked smile on his lips.
Amelia bit his hand hard until she tasted blood, but he didn't get angry.

"You'll pay for biting me," he said after a moment, his gaze deep,"Your punishment is to be my secret lover."
###Chapter 82

Amelia's eyes went wide. "What? No way!"

She couldn't believe it. Had Chris lost his mind? How could he ask for something so ridiculous?


Chris didn't get mad. Instead, he just smiled and lifted her chin. "What other choice do you have besides being with me?"

A cold flash crossed Amelia's eyes, and she was seriously pissed.

"You're disgusting," she spat through clenched teeth, glaring at him.

Chris seemed pleased with her reaction. "You know better than anyone that only I can protect you now. You kissed me in front of that assistant.Imagine how Lucius will react if he finds out you and I have already..."


"Shut up?" Amelia grabbed a throw pillow and chucked it at him. "You're disgusting and shameless. You forced me."

Chris's smile turned even more wicked. "Whether you were forced or not,it happened. You can't change that."

He added after a moment of pause, "So you better stay with me."

Amelia rolled her eyes, enduring the discomfort of her body, and got ready to head to the gallery.

Sophia came over, telling her that Diana had visited Owen a few days ago and warned her to be careful.

Amelia's face changed instantly, and she grabbed Owen, who was playing with a puzzle. "Did Mrs. Spencer come to see you alone?"
Owen shrugged. "Mom, chill. The crisis is over."

Both Amelia and Sophia were stunned. "What do you mean by that?" they asked together.

Owen dusted off his little hands. "Mrs. Spencer probably has proof I'm not Dad's biological kid, so you don't need to worry. Nothing's gonna happen.That day,someone came to the kindergarten to collect my DNA, and I swapped my hair with Raymond's. Easy peasy."

"But for a paternity test, they need hair with follicles," Amelia said,shocked.


Owen stayed calm. "Yep. I pulled it out from Raymond, but I promised to do something for him in return."

Amelia and Sophia exchanged glances, both surprised and impressed.

Owen was quite a smart boy!

"So, relax," Owen grinned,showing his cute little canine teeth.

Amelia hugged him. "Sweetheart, you're amazing."

"Amelia, Mr. Howard is here," Sophia reminded her.

Amelia quickly got up and saw Lucius standing there in a perfectly tailored black suit, looking all serious.

He usually preferred white because of his slight cleanliness obsession,so seeing him in black was rare.

Sophia took Owen outside, leaving just the two of them in the reception room.
"Have you made up your mind?" Lucius asked directly. "Leaving me for Chris."


His voice had a strange mix of emotions, like he was regretting something.

Amelia nodded. "Yes. I've worked hard to get here. I have to keep moving forward."


Lucius was silent. The air felt like it froze.

"Then I wish you success." After a moment, Lucius suddenly stepped forward and hugged her. Before Amelia could react, she heard him whisper, "Chris is here."


Amelia got it instantly.

"We're impossible." she said loudly, trying to push him away.

But Lucius held her shoulders firmly, speaking each word with force. "No.I won't let go. I've waited for you for so many years!"

"Stop!" Chris burst in, his face livid.

He stormed forward, shoving Lucius away and landing a heavy punch on his face.


Amelia was shocked. "What are you doing?"

She rushed to help Lucius, but Chris yanked her back.

Chris glared at Lucius, teeth clenched. "She's mine."

The tension between them was thick, and word quickly reached Victor.

They were summoned to The Spencer Mansion.
"What is going on, Chris? Are you out of your mind?" Victor was trembling with rage, his cane striking the ground repeatedly, as if he might swing it at Chris any second.

Chris stood there, eyes downcast, showing no sign of guilt. "It's exactly as you see."


In other words, 'Deal with it however you want.'

"She's my girlfriend," Lucius spoke up, his face still bearing the marks of the fight. Always meticulous, he now looked a bit disheveled but mostly angry.

Victor looked at Lucius with particular helplessness. "You two have been making a scene recently. It's said that you had broken up."

Hearing this, Chris was delighted and pretended to be nonchalant. "That's right. You've already abandoned her. We're both single. Why can't I pursue her? Besides, she was mine to begin with. It's you who..."

"Shut up!" Victor swung his cane, hitting Chris's shoulder hard.

It wasn't a light hit, and Chris groaned in pain, almost dropping to one knee.


"You have no bottom line. Go to the prayer room and reflect. I'll deal with you later," Victor said, suppressing his anger.

Chris turned and walked away, his steps casual and unhurried. After a few steps, he turned back and said, "No matter what you decide, she's mine."

"You should be ashamed of yourself, get out!" Victor's face twisted with anger.
After a moment of contemplation, he calmed down and looked at Lucius."What do you think?"

Lucius lowered his eyes and remained silent.

After a long time, Lucius said, "I won't give up."

Victor held his head, almost fainting.

Victor waved his hand. "You go too. I'need to talk to Bella."

In the large study. only Victor and Amelia were left.

Amelia kept her head down, not daring to say a word, afraid that Victor would see through all her thoughts.

"What, you made a mess and now don't dare to look at me?" Victor sneered coldly. "Raise your head!"


Amelia was startled, her face pale, and she had to look up at him as instructed.


At this moment, Victor's old face had an expression so familiar, just like she had seen many times in the past years, making her tense up.

"Amelia, you acted well. Have you had enough revenge?" Victor sneered.

Amelia's heart trembled even more, a chill rising from her feet, almost overwhelming her.

Victor had indeed recognized her long ago, but he hadn't discovered her true intentions.


That was a small blessing in misfortune.
Amelia didn't intend to hide anymore. She abandoned the pretense and said to Victor, "Grandpa. I know I was wrong."

"Do you? Seriously?" Victor glared at her. "You've become quite capable during the years, almost fooling me."


Amelia's face turned awkward, and she lowered her head again.

"Why did you have to get involved between those two?"Victor sighed deeply. "Do you hate Chris that much?"
###Chapter 83

Amelia was at a loss for words and just stayed quiet.

Victor didn't say anything either; they just sat there, and the two of them were stuck in a standoff.


Amelia couldn't take the pressure anymore and said, "Grandpa, I can't just let this go. Mr. Howard saved me back then."

That explained why she was with Lucius.

"So you two teamed up to play tricks on Chris?" Victor laughed angrily,clearly surprised.

Chris had been groomed as the future heir since he was a kid, a super-elite with a totally rational mind and almost no weaknesses.

Yet this guy had fallen into a love trap and couldn't get out.

Or maybe he knew exactly what was happening, watching himself get played by Amelia step by step, but couldn't break free.

Amelia rubbed her hands, thinking about how to reply, but Victor spoke again, "What are you planning to do now? You can handle being scolded to your face; when did you get so tough?"

His words were both angry and helpless.

Amelia gave a bitter smile, "Grandpa, I used to get scolded to my face in the Spencer family too."

In the past, she was like a stray dog on the street, anyone could come by and step on her,berate her.
Compared to that, her situation now was nothing.

Victor gave her a long look and stayed silent for a while.

A few minutes later, he said heavily, "Since you don't know what to do,then listen to me."


Meanwhile, in the prayer room.

Diana had someone follow her, bringing a blanket and some food into the prayer room.


Chris was sitting on the prayer mat with a straight back, following Victor's orders.

"What are you thinking, making Dad mad over a bitch not worth it? I don't know what good it does for you." Diana blamed, glaring at her son,signaling the two servants to bring the stuff in.

Chris didn't say a word, ignoring the thoughtful items.

Diana was furious that she slapped his shoulder, "Chris, are you trying to drive me crazy? I just heard Dad say he's going to give your position as head of the family and CEO to Lucius. Look at what you've done!"

Chris's expression changed slightly, but he wasn't too surprised. When he competed with Lucius for Amelia, he had already seen this coming.

Lucius had gotten what he wanted.

Chris would take it as repaying him for saving Amelia back then.

"It's no big deal." Chris smiled indifferently, "I can survive without the family."
Diana slapped him on the face, "You ungrateful son, shut up. If your grandfather knew, he would be furious."

Chris didn't care, "Mom, please leave. Don't disturb me."

Seeing his firm attitude, Diana's eyes darkened.

She ordered someone to pour a cup of warm water, "At least have some water, or don't call me Mom anymore!"

Chris reluctantly took the water, drank it all in one go, and threw the cup back onto the servant's tray.

Only then did Diana leave.

Outside, Leila was eagerly waiting, "Mrs. Spencer, how is Chris?"

Diana pulled Leila aside, away from others, and said coldly, "I'll go tell Dad that Chris has a fever. He'll definitely let him go back to his room.I drugged his water. You better seize this opportunity."

Leila was thrilled and nodded quickly, "Sure, I won't let you down, Mrs.Spencer."


As expected, soon Chris had a fever due to the drug, and Victor had him taken back temporarily, then called Lucius over to officially tell him that he was now in charge of the family.

Leila gently pushed open Chris's bedroom door. The room was dimly lit,and Chris had been settled in, lying quietly on the bed.

He was now semi-conscious, controlled by the strong drug,completely at her mercy.

Leila took off her clothes as she slowly walked over. By the time she
reached the bed, only a silver backless camisole with a good sheen was left on her body.


Her slender long legs were exposed, looking alluring in the dim night outside.


The drug had taken effect on Chris,and he was sweating profusely,his face red, suffering from the desire.

Leila's heart raced as she lay down beside him, feeling the unique male hormone scent.


He was so attractive, making her intoxicated.

The next morning, Chris woke up first. He didn't look well, his face pale,struggling to sit up.

"Chris, are you okay?" Leila was awakened by his movements and quickly got up to help him.

Chris glanced at her naked body out of the corner of his eye, his gaze turning icy.


"Why are you here?" He sneered.

Lela hurriedly wrapped herself in the blanket, lowering her head,"Chris,you were sick yesterday. Mrs. Spencer asked me to take care of you,but I didn't expect you to..."


She hugged her knees helplessly, tears welling up, her vulnerable expression making it clear what had happened to her.

Chris went silent,getting up to dress.

Leila was stunned for a moment, then cried louder, "Chris, I know you
didn't mean it. Let's pretend nothing happened. I won't use this to threaten you."

"Shut up!" Chris's voice was cold, "Do you think I'm as stupid as you?"

Leila's body stiffened at the shout.

"Chris, how can you say that about me?"

"Should we get a professional doctor to examine if we had sex last night?"Chris mocked, not stopping his quick dressing.

Leila's face turned ashen, her heart sinking, "Chris, how can you humiliate me like this? After all. I am..."

"Stop!" Chris coldly questioned,"Where is Amelia?"

He had a bad feeling that ä lot had happenéd last night, yet he knew absolutely nothing about it.

Leila shook her head weakly, "I've been here all along, unaware of what happened."


Although she was still putting on a strong performance, her heart was completely filled with despair as she recalled what had happened last night.

Back then, Chris mistook her for Amelia. At first, he was clearly overwhelmed with desire, uncontrollably approaching. But just as he touched her, he suddenly sobered up and passed out, never waking up again. Leila was bothanxious and angry, but there was nothing she could do.

Chris quickly left the room. Despite his body still feeling weak,he rushed
to Victor immediately.

At this time, Victor was instructing Lucius on preparing for the succession ceremony in a week.


Seeing the two of them, one standing and one sitting, with a calm demeanor, Chris became even more anxious, "Grandpa, where is Amelia?"
###Chapter 84

Victor shot him an impatient look, "Seriously? You couldn't even dress properly? Is this how you show respect?"

Chris looked like a mess. His usually neat hair was all over the place, his clothes were a disaster, and he looked like he hadn't slept in days-pale and exhausted.


"I don't care about that right now," Chris snapped, "Where is she?"

"I sent her awvay!" Victor's eyes were cold as ice. "You're willing to throw away your reputation for a woman? That's just pathetic!"

"Where did you send her?" Chris's face turned stone cold.

"Somewhere you'll never find," Victor's gaze was sharp as he waved his hand. "Take him away and lock him up."

Chris glared at the bodyguards, his presence so intimidating that they hesitated to move.

Just then, Diana rushed over, "Dad, what's happening?"

"Ask your son!" Victor huffed and turned away.

Diana's face went pale. Seeing Chris's defiant stance, she was furious.

"Why are you being so stubborn, making your grandfather this mad?"

"Grandpa, where is she?" Chris demanded, stepping closer. "If you don't tell me,I'll find her myself!"

"Shut up! What nonsense are you spouting?" Diana was nearly losing it.
Victor waved his hand dismissively, "Get out!"

Diana begged Victor to change his mind, but he was firm and unyielding.

Meanwhile, Amelia was already on a plane to Celestria.

She stared out the window at the blue sky and white clouds, feeling a bit lost.


She was going abroad, and it was Victor who sent her away. How absurd.

She touched her belly, unsure if she had achieved what she wanted.

Two days later, she arrived at a secluded island in Celestria, realizing it was a private island Victor had bought when he was young,beautifully developed.

Holly Reyes, a kind woman in her forties, was the housekeeper responsible for taking care of her.

Holly was very warm and friendly to Amelia, unlike other Spencer family servants who treated people differently based on their status. No wonder Victor had chosen her.


Amelia's stay on the island cut off her contact with the outside world,but Holly promised to provide updates on the people she wanted to know about. So, every two days, Amelia would ask about Sophia and Owen,occasionally about Lucius, but never mentioned Chris.

The island was stunning, and on sunny days, the sea appeared a jelly-like light blue. Walking on the beach, with the seawater soaking her ankles, it felt like it could wash away all worries.

She wasn't allowed to contact the outside world, so she could only paint to
relieve her loneliness.

She painted many beautiful seascapes, and sometimes,when she was in the mood. she would paint one for Holly, who often marveled at the privilege of having someone as talented as Amelia paint for her.

But gradually, Amelia began to feel inexplicably irritable.

She had a nagging impulse to ask about Chris. After all, they had been out of touch for two weeks. She wondered if he had started a new life or was looking for her.


But Holly never volunteered any information. One day, Amelia couldn't take it anymore and asked, but Holly dodged the question and wouldn't give a straight answer.

Amelia sensed something was off.

"What's going on with him? What happened? Why don't you tell me?"She snapped at Holly for the first time.


Holly,looking helpless, fimally told the truth, "Mr. Chris Spencer has been searching for you all over the world, using a lotof resources and power,which really ticked off Mr. Victor Spencer. He had him dragged back and locked up."

Amelia was stunned, thinking she must have misheard.

"What are you talking about?" Her face was a mix of confusion and disbelief.

Holly sighed and didn't repeat herself.

Amelia sat alone for a long time, trying to wrap her head around Chris's
actions.

Did he really think she was that important? What a joke.

Meanwhile, back at the Spencer Mansion.

Lucius brought a bunch of food and took the private elevator down to the third basement level.


There were fifteen top-notch bodyguards here, all ex-special forces. Victor had never been willing to use them before, but now he unexpectedly used them on his own grandson.

These guys formed two layers of human shields. No matter how strong Chris was,he couldn't break out.

Plus, Victor had drugged him with a muscle-weakening agent, leaving him with less than a third of his strength.

When Lucius showed up, the bodyguards all stepped aside, making way for him.


At the end of the corridor, Chris sat against the wall, looking like an angry leopard, making everyone too scared to get close.

Lucius raised an eyebrow and smirked, "Chris, I brought you some food."

His tone was almost pitying, like he was talking to a beaten opponent.

Chris slowly lifted his eyelids, "What do you want?"

He straightened up, refusing to lose his pride and self-esteem in front of his old rival.

Lucius said casually, "I want to see the joke you make of yourself."
Chris instantly lost it, jumping up and punching the thick glass door.

With a loud crash, the door shattered, and his hand was covered in glass shards,bleeding everywhere.


The medical staff nearby rushed over to treat his wound, but he shoved them away.


Unfortunately, his punch couldn't reach Lucius's face.

They were separated by a cage made of special materials.


Chris had never been beaten this badly. But he wouldn't admit Lucius had won.


"Fuck off!" He growled through gritted teeth.

Lucius's mockery was obvious, "I've never seen you like this."


But there was no extra joy on his face. It seemed like everything he had finally gotten wasn't as great as he thought.

He had what he wanted, but he had also pushed Amelia out of his life forever.


He wasn't sure if it was worth it.


"Are you planning to go on a hunger strike?" Lucius taunted, "If you think that'll make Dad soften up, you're wrong. He hates being threatened."

With that,he left.

Chris stayed silent for a long time, until someone gave him a sedative, and under its influence, he fell into a deep sleep.
When Chris opened his eyes again, Diana and Leila were sitting by his bed,worried. They kept calling his name, looking both upset and concerned,which made Chris even more irritable.


But then he realized he had been released.

"Move." He got up and tried to run.
###Chapter 85

Diana grabbed him roughly, "Whnat the hell are you doing? Do you even realize Dad's guys areall over the place? He's been pretty chill with you,but you keep pushing it. Are you trying to get yourself killed?"

Seeing Chris in such a bad shape, Diana's hatred for Amelia hit an all-time high.


Why did that lowly Amelia get to leave in good condition with Victor,while her son had to suffer here?

"Let go of me." Chris's strength wasn't what it used to be, and he couldn't even shake off Diana.


His face was grim. "I'm not giving up until I find her."

"You're driving me nuts!" Diana turned around, pointing at him and yelling, "Idiot! Your reckless search for her is just gonna piss Dad off more and make him more determined to keep you from finding her. If you could just chill out, or at least pretend to give up, Dad might ease up and give you a chance."

Diana was at her wit's end; she couldn't stand watching her son destroy himself.


Chris suddenly froze. She actually made sense.

So, for a while, he calmed down. He pulled back all his men,personally apologized to Victor, and stayed at his place, claiming he was recuperating.

As time went on, Chris gradually returned to a normal life. He stopped managing the company's heavy affairs and spent his days eating, drinking,and having fun with Nolan and the others.
He became the cener of the gossip of the town, as it was the first time he had been directly dismissed and controlled by the family head.

One night, he was drinking with Nolan at a club.

"Let's toast to Mr. Spencer, celebrating his newfound freedom," Nolan said with a cheeky grin, being the only one who dared to tease Chris like that.

Chris lazily glared at him but didn't get mad. He raised his glass and drank with everyone, looking carefree.

"Chris, stop drinking." Leila weakly advised.

Everyone paused for a few seconds, then whispered about how Leila couldn't read the room. Chris was in a good mood, and she was killing the vibe.


"Get out." Chris turned his head nonchalantly, gving her a cold look, "Don't make me say it twice."


Leila stiffened, her face turning pale as she stumbled out.

The atmosphere got tense for a moment.

Nolan joked, "You have no sense of tenderness and care for women, at least she..." He stopped mid-sentence, seeing Chris's cold gaze, and quickly changed his tone, "Let's carry on. I'm glad that you've finally got some free time."


The group continued drinking, partying, and having a wild time.

Chris seemed to get drunk, his face flushed, and his eyes became hazy.

He saw a familiar figure approaching, looking gentle like a little kitten,"Chris, stop drinking, it's bad for your health. I'm worried about you."
He was momentarily dazed, reaching out to touch, but unsure who this person was.

The old Amelia.or...

Yes, it was the old Amelia, different from the current Amelia who was surprisingly resilient. Back then, she was always soft and gentle,never getting angry no matter how he mistreated her.

In the past, he just wanted to see how long this little kitten could hold out.So he kept testing her, hurting her over and over, watching her cry,and being heartless each time.


At first, he did it to get back at her for ruining his reputation. But for some reason, every time he looked into her clear, bright eyes, all his anger seemed to disappear in an instant.

He didn't hate her as much as he thought.

In fact, sometimes, he even felt a strange pity for her.

This subtle feeling made him angry, and losing control made him irritable.

And the cycle continued.


"Chris, Ryder wants to see you," Nolan suddenly patted his shoulder and said urgently, "He says he has something to report."

Chris waved his hand, "Let him come over."


Ryder walked in quickly, and by then, Nolan had cleared out the others.Ryder said in a deep voice, "Mr. Chris Spencer, Mr. Victor Spencer suddenly sent two expert doctors to Celestria. I suspect something's up."

Chris, who had been dazed, immediately snapped to attention,his voice
cold,"Let's go!"

Nolan was shocked by his quick action.

Chris and his men secretly followed Victor's people to a small island in Celestria. It used to be a tourist resort but it vanished from maps when Victor bought it.

No wonder he couldn't find it.

Two days later. Chris arrived. He found that the island's defenses weren't tight, but the whole place was filled with tension.

"Could it be that Ms. White is sick?" Ryder speculated.

Chris's face darkened, "Ill drive, you navigate."

Ryder was somewhat uneasy, knowing how terrifying Chris's driving speed could be.


In less than half an hour, they reached the villa complex at the island's center.


This was the most heavily guarded area, with many mercenaries and heavy weapons.

Chris had too few men to confront them head-on, so he planned to use strategy. But the gate suddenly opened.


Chris was then convinced that Victor deliberately led him here to see Amelia.


Meanwhile, Amelia was trembling in pain.

She had just undergone surgery and hadn't recovered from a near-death
state.On top of that, she had suffered a huge emotional blow and was on the verge of breaking down.

Holly brought in some chicken soup, "Eat something. You haven't eaten in two days. You just... your body is severely damaged. You need to replenish."

Amelia shook her head, "I can't eat. Take it away."

The baby she got from huge efforts was in the wrong place, growing in her fallopian tube, causing massive bleeding and nearly killing her.

Amelia's heart was shattered. She had tried so hard, only to get such a disappointing result.

She felt she had let her children down and was utterly devastated.

Though the surgery was done, her abdomen still suffered from faint pain,reminding her of her failure.


"Don't be like this." Holly felt heartbroken seeing her so dejected, "You're young. If you take care of yourself, you can still have children. If you give up now, there's really no hope."

"What?" A cold voice suddenly came.

Amelia froze, instinctively looking towards the door. It was Chris. How did he get here?


"You had a miscarriage?" Chris quickly approached, his gaze particularly serious.
###Chapter 86

He stared at her intently, and a strong sense of hostility immediately erupted from his entire being.

Right now. Amelia looked so fragile, her face all pale.

She just leaned against the headboard, staring blankly out the window,a dried tear at the corner of her eye, like she'd given up on everything.

When she heard his words, she frowned instinctively, not sure if she was dreaming or if this was real. He was already by her side,sitting down and holding her cold hand.

"How could this happen, the baby..."

"Shut up!" Amelia snapped, and in that moment, all her anger,disappointment, and regret flared up. She instinctively blamed him.

He was the father, he should share the pain she was going through.

"Holly,get him out." Amelja's voice was raspy.

Chris's face kept changing, thinking she was mad at him for not using a condom during sex, leading to the damage to her body.

So, he tried to be patient and comfort her, "DDon't be like this, it'll pass. I'll get someone to help you recover, and if you want a child in the future..."

"I don't. Get out!" Amelia pushed him away and turned her back on him.

Holly stepped in, "Mr. Spencer, Ms. White isn't in a good mood right now,maybe you should go out and rest for a bit."

As soon as she said that, Chris shot her a cold look, and Holly shivered,
walking out with two nurses quitely.

Now it was just the two of them in the big ward.

"It's my fault." Chris sighed, looking at her with a mix of emotions.

They'd been married for years without a kid, and she'd faced all kinds of gossip because of it.

But now, they had a child only to lose it. That kind of pain was huge,no wonder she couldn't handle it.

"Didn't you hear me? I told you to leave! Besides, the child isn't yours.why are you blaming yourself?" Amelia sneered, looking at him like he was an idiot.


Chris was furious, "Don't joke about this!"

Amelia was pleased with his anger, and said slowly, "I'm telling the truth,are you scared to hear it?"

Chris stared at her for a long time, holding back his anger, and then left the ward.

He went to find the doctor and learned that the baby in Amelia's belly was less than a month old and that an ectopic pregnancy had caused her to bleed heavily and almost die. His anger faded.


After all, he was partly to blame for her suffering. But she was so stubborn.

"Mr, Spencer, Ms. White's mental state has been poor these past few days,please don't provoke her." Holly's voice was almost pleading.

Chris glanced at her, "Is there any way to make her feel better?"
Holly thought for a moment, "MMs. White hasn't had much of an appetite lately and rarely eats. If you can get her to eat something, it would really help her body."

Chris waved his hand, "Got it."

That afternoon, Chris walked into the kitchen for the first time, shocking everyone.

"Teach me a simple, easy-to-make, delicious, and nutritious dish," he demanded.


The five-star chefs in the kitchen were all stunned.

They looked at each other, all wanting to bolt.

Not to mention anything else, just considering Chris's crazy request and his zero knowledge of cooking, it seemed almost impossible to make something edible.

The kitchen went silent.

Chris grew impatient, his face darkening, "What, is this too hard for you guys?"


He snorted, his presence a bit intimidating.


The head chef, Fabian Bowen, suddenly had an idea, "There is a dish that s simple, easy to learn, delicious, and nutritious."

Chris raised an eyebrow, "What is it?"

Fabian beamed,"Spaghetti with tomato sauce."

"How to cook< it?" Chris asked.
Fabian quickly grabbed a tablet and explained, "You cook the spaghetti until it's done, drain it, then make the tomato sauce, mix it with the spaghetti, sprinkle some cheese on top, andI you have a nutritious and delicious dish."

Chris frowned, "That's it? Sounds pretty basic."

Fabian rolled his eyes internally, thinking, 'The point is, you can't handle anything more complicated.'

Holly quickly chimed in, "Mr. Spencer, spaghetti with tomato sauce is not only easy to make and delicious, but it's also easy to digest and won't burden a weak body. Plus, we have to consider your ability to complete it,right?"

He frowned deeply, "What do you mean? You think I can't do it?"

Holly was at a loss for words and lowered her head awkwardly.

Soon, Chris signaled the others to help him get started with the spaghetti.They first arranged an apron for Chris and put on gloves to avoid him cutting his hand while slicing the tomatoes. They even washed the tomatoes and took out the cheese.


Chris disdainfully took off the gloves, "Wearing gloves to cut a tomato?You guys are so delicate."

Fabian and the others exchanged glances.

It wasn't that they were delicate, it was that Mr. Spencer's fingers were delicate.


"Just chop the tomatoes finely," Fabian carefully instructed.
Chris started, the first cut was very successful, the second cut was barely acceptable, the third cut, the tomato rolled, and everyone gasped,but he wasn't hurt.

Chris grew impatient, and his pride and confidence were challenged.

It was just a damn tomato, how hard could it be to cut?

He used a bit of force, and as he cut down, he felt a pain in his left pinky.

When his blood started to flow, everyone panicked.

"Mr. Spencer's hand is injured!"

"Quick, get a bandage for Mr. Spencer."

"Let us handle it. Mr. Spencer, could you please take a break?"

Everyone was in chaos.

Chris was extremely annoyed and told everyone to leave,leaving only Fabian.


After much effort and four failed attempts, the spaghetti with tomato sauce was finally barely presentable.

Chris personally brought the spaghetti to the ward.

Before this, Holly had repeatedly reminded Amelia to avoid the negative comments, as Chris had spent the entire afternoon making it, and she should at least take a few bites and not give it a bad review.

Amelia was momentarily stunned.

He actually made food for her in person.
He probably didn't even know where the stove switch was.

A plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce was quickly placed in frot of her.

Chris's expression was aloof, "Just something I threw together, try it."

Amelia thought, she still needed to get his sperm in the future, so she couldn't completely ignore him now.

She had to suppress her emotions and reluctantly took it, taking a bite.

The first bite was a bit sour, but after eating it, there was a slight sweetness,the noodles were a bit soft, but still edible.

This plate of spaghetti was actually passable.

"You made this?" Her expression was intriguing.

Chris was secretly pleased, almost unable to suppress a smile,coughed,and raised an eyebrow at her, "Is it delicious?"
###Chapter 87

Amelia was at a loss for words. "It's kinda sour. Maybe adding some sugar to the tomato sauce would make it better."

Chris felt a wave of frustration. Fabian had told him to add sugar while he was cooking, but he only put in half a spoon because he remembered Amelia didn't like sweet food.


He didn't expect to get criticized for it.

"Aren't you the one who doesn't like sweet stuff?" he asked, feeling a bit down.

Amelia's gaze turned cold. "I've always liked sweet food. You must be confusing me with someone else."

Chris glared at her, sullen. "You're lucky to have food to eat. Just eat it."

"When are you going back?" Amelia asked.

Chris was infuriated. "I haven't even been here for two days, and youa're already trying to get ridof me!"


"Mr. Victor Spencer wanted me to reflect on my own here, not with you.If he finds out..."


"Cut the crap. Once you recover, I'll take you out," Chris said,standing up abruptly and leaving.


With a professional medical team treating her and a top-notch nutritionist taking care of her, Amelia recovered in less than three weeks.

During this time, Chris stayed there, insisting on helping take care of her.
He slept on the companion bed in her room at night, made her breakfast in the morning, ordered her to nap in the afternoon, and took her out to see the sea in the evening.

As time passed, the anxiety and restlessness hidden in Amelia's heart gradually disappeared.

One day, he took her out to sea and prepared bird food for her to feed the seagulls on the deck.

Amelia wore a pristine white dress, and as the sea breeze blew, her silhouette became faintly visible.

Chris watched silently, his thoughts drifting away.

At this moment, she was pure and unadorned, her long hair quietly draped over her shoulders, looking more and more like the Amelia from the past.

Sometimes he feltlike it wasn't four years later, but they had gone back to the past.


He wasn't sure how his feelings had changed, only that every moment spent with her now made him extremely content.

Suddenly, Amelia let out a cry of surprise, dropping the bird food in her hand.


Chris quickly approached. "What's wrong?"

Amelia's face was pale. Her hand had been pecked by a bird's beak,turning red and slightly painful.

"It's nothing," she said, pushing his hand away.
It had been almost a month, and she still instinctively rejected his closeness.

Chris didn't get angry. He picked up another bag of bird food,poured it into his hand, and extended his arm over the deck. "Watch this."

Many seagulls flew down, standing on the deck railing and eating the bird food from his hand.

Amelia's expression gradually changed, a hint of joy appearing.

Seeing her in a good mood, Chris was about to speak when a seagull suddenly took off and then pooped on his shoulder.

Amelia witnessed the scene and couldn't stop laughing. "Haha, Chris, a seagull pooped on you."

Chris's anger inexplicably dissipated.

Her laughter was beautiful and pure and reminded him of the Amelia he first met.


Yes, when they first met at a party a few years ago, she was such a lively and adorable girl.

But later, things changed, and her spirit was gradually extinguished.

"Are you OK?" Amelia waved her hand in front of him.

Chris suddenly stepped forward and hugged her.

"The day after tomorrow, there's an auction at Celestria. I'll take you there to relax and have some fun," Chris said.

Amelia pulled away from his embrace. "No, your grandpa won't let me go
out."

"Grandpa isn't here now, it's just us. I'm in charge," Chris replied."There will be an original painting by Thomas Lawrence at the auction. You've been a big fan of him for a long time."

Amelia was immediately tempted.

That evening, she packed her things in her room. Chris said the trip would take at least four or five days, and after the auction, they could explore the area.

She wanted to bring a few more clothes. Standing by the bed,she placed the folded clothes into the suitcase when suddenly a warm hand touched her waist, making her feel ticklish.

She stiffened and turned to glare at Chris. "What are you doing? My period is coming soon."

"That means it hasn't come yet," Chris said, picking her up and walking towards the bed.

Amelia hurriedly struggled. "I'm not fully recovered yet!"

Chris's face immediately fell. He had clearly asked the doctor, and she was now fit for sex.


Fine, women were delicate. He would respect that.

"When will you be ready?" he asked, sitting on her bed and picking up a silk nightgown. "This dress is beautiful. It would look great on you."

Amelia ignored him.

They took a night flight and arrived at the hotel provided by the
organizers the next afternoon.

After settling in, they went downstairs to eat.

They didn't notice a strange gaze fixed on them from behind.

Stella couldn't believe her eyes as she watched the two figures walking away, thinking she must be mistaken.

Amelia, no, she was Bella now.

Wasn't she Lucius's girlfriend? How could she be with Chris now? She really was shameless, climbing up to Lucius wasn't enough, she also wanted to seduce Chris.

"What's wrong?" Jared Cruz asked, coming up behind her and noticing her unpleasant face.

Jared was her new boyfriend, whose family was in the diamond business.He was very wealthy and adored her,fulfilling her every wish.

He had suggested bringing her to this auction, claiming he wanted to buy her a sapphire necklace once worn by a European princess.

Stella shook her head. "Nothing, let's go eat."

But she was thinking that Amelia and Chris were probably here for the auction too. She needed to find a way to teach that bitch a lesson.


"Celestria has been unstable lately, with armed groups frequently active.We should be careful," Jared said, putting his arm around Stella's shoulder.

Stella paused, a flash of inspiration crossing her mind.

An armed attack? She had never encountered such a thing, and Amelia
probably hadn't either.

"Stella, what are you thinking?" Jared thought his words had scared her and patted her shoulder reassuringly. "Don't worry, this area is absolutely safe."


Stella nodded, but she was thinking that anything was possible.


After all, an attack on foreign guests could affect the political situation between two countries.


After dinner, Amelia and Chris returned to the hotel around midnight.Amelia yawned but noticed two rows of armed soldiers outside the hotel,which surprised her.

"What are they doing? Why are they carrying guns?"


Chris explained, "The auction attracts wealthy businessmen from various countries. The Celestria government is taking extra precautions to prevent any trouble."

Amelia made a mental note to be cautious.
###Chapter 88

"Wherever I go, you gotta follow me, got it?" Chris wrapped his arm around her waist and swiped his card to get into the hotel.

Amelia quickly pushed his hand away and kept her distance, "Don't touch me, you might bump into someone you know."

Chris glared at her, "T'm not scared, what are you afraid of?"


Amelia snorted. "I'm afraid of being embarrassed."

"Ms. White? What a surprise. Why are you not out with Uncle Lucius?" A familiar voice chimed in from behind.

Amelia's mind buzzed, and when she turned around, she saw it was Stella.

What a small world.

"Go away." Before she could say anything, Chris had already stepped forward and glared at Stella.


Stella's face stiffened, "Did I say something wrong? Chris, you can have any girlfriend you want, why are you with this bitch? Aren't you afraid people will talk behind your back and ruin your reputation?"


Stella had been traveling abroad with Jared recently and didn't know what had happened back home.


"You go ahead, I'll handle this." Chris pushed Amelia into the hotel and then came back.


"Stella, mind your own business. This is my last warning." Chris's voice was icy and frightening.
Stella felt a cold shiver rise from the soles of her feet, standing there stiffly,not knowing what to do.

Amelia didn't ask any questions when Chris came back, quietly went to bed, and looked forward to the auction.

But the next day, an old friend of Chris visited and asked to meet him on a small island in Celestria.

"Then you should go," Amelia didn't ask any questions when getting the news.

Chris's business spanned many countries, so having a few friends was perfectly normal.


Chris's face clouded over, and he glared at her, "Cruel woman, you don't even ask where I'm going, whether it's safe or dangerous."

Amelia was taken aback and couldn't help but laugh, "Given your identity and numerous bodyguards, what could be unsafe?"


Chris ignored her, pulled a lady's handgun from his back, andI handed it to her, "Keep this for self-defense."


Amelia took it smoothly, "Alright."

She had learned a lot over the past few years, and hershooting skills were pretty good.


Chris was surprised, looking at her as ifshe were an alien, "When did you learn to shoot?"


"You should have investigated me, you know better than I do." Amelia skillfully loaded the bullets and aimed the gun at Chris's forehead,her
eyes flashing with murderous intent.

Chris raised an eyebrow and smiled,"Not bad."

"Tll leave all my bodyguards to protect you." Before leaving,he reminded her again,looking a bit worried.

"No need." Amelia said, "This hotel has a lot of bodyguards. If you leave more, it would only be redundant. You should take them with you."

She was also afraid he might get hurt. After all, she was counting on his body being intact to get his sperm.

After some discussion, they decided to split the bodyguards evenly, each taking four.

The auction was at 8 PM, and Chris left at 10 AM, indicating he would be back by 7 PM.

The hotel had hot springs, horseback riding, and golf. Amelia changed into riding gear, took a tour of the stables with the room service staff, had some desserts, and was about to head back after soaking.

She didn't expect to run into Stella again. To be precise, Stella came looking for her.


"What are you trying to do, seducing one man after another, treating the men of the Spencer family like your playthings?" Stella stood above the hot spring, glaring down at Amelia with pure hostility.

Amelía splashed some water on her arm and replied nonchalantly,"It's all because of you,"

Stella's face turned red with anger, "What does this have to do with me?"
"Exactly." Amelia said lazily, "What does it have to do with you?"

Stella was fuming. "You shameless bitch. I warn you, don't show up with my brother tonight, or I'll take pictures and show themn to Uncle Lucius.Then you'll be dead!"

Amelia looked at her with interest, "Oh, you can kill me? I'll belooking forward to it."

"You..." Stella was aImost driven mad with anger. Amelia was hard to deal with and shameless to the extreme.

"Miss Spencer, you should take care of yourself first. In a foreign country,if something happens, it won't be good." Amelia gave her a mocking look,got out of the hot spring from the other side, wrapped herself in a towel,and left.


Watching her carefree back, Stella's face turned livid.

"Bitch, who do you think you are!"

Stella deeply felt that staying in the same hotel with someone like Amelia was a disgrace.


But Jared had told her that there were at least eight well-trained bodyguards outside Amelia's room.


In other words, she had no chance to make a move.

Stella returned to her room, fuming, and Jared took out the evening gown he had prepared for her to try on.

Only then did Stella feel a bit better because Jared had prepared a dazzling diamond necklace for her, making her look stunning.
In other aspects, she was better than that bitch Amelia, and she wanted her face and body to be definitely superior, too.

As she admired herself in the mirror, the room suddenly went dark.

Stella was startled and heard shouting from outside.

Before she could react, a terrifying explosion sounded, and a scorching heat wave knocked her over.

In the darkness, the power of the bomb was immense, and the hallway.was filled with terrifying flames that could burn everything.

"Are you okay?" Jared quickly helped her up and took her to the bathroom,"Quick, take off your clothes."

With Jared's help, Stella took off the cumbersome evening gown, leaving herself in a camisole and shorts, but at this moment, she couldn't care about that.


Suddenly, anxious voices came from outside the room. The intruders were loudly searching for someone.


Stella happened to understand the language of this country and realized they were looking for a woman.


In a flash, Stella made a decision and shouted, "She's in room 103,hurry up!"

Room 103 was at the far end of the floor, Amelia's room. Despite not knowing who they were looking for, she wanted to divert the trouble to Amelia.

As soon as she finished speaking, someone shone a flashlight into the
room. Jared hid with her in the bedroom closet, holding their breath,narrowly escaping.

Jared was puzzled, "What are you doing?"

Stella leaned weakly against him, saying cautiously, "Don't blame me,Jared,I'm just afraid we'll get caught up in this."

As soon as the incident happened. Amelia opened the door to let the bodyguards in. The hallway was engulfed in flames, and two of them were burned, in bad shape.

They were outnumbered, and the enemies were too many, so a direct confrontation was not wise.

At that moment, Amelia heard a familiar shout, and Stella's face flashed in her mind.
###Chapter 89

The next moment, Amelia and the bodyguards hear the frantic footsteps of those desperados charging at them.

"Shit!" Amelia muttered, not giving a damn about Stella anymore. In a panic, she shot the balcony glass and yelled, "Let's jump from here!"

There was a swimming pool below, and jumping into it wouldn't hurt them.


"After you!" Amelia ordered the bodyguards.

"No way, Ms. White goes first," the head bodyguard insisted urgently.

Amelia didn't want to waste any more time. Without thinking, she climbed over the railing and jumped from the third floor.


As she leaped, a stray bullet grazed her shoulder, and blood started to flow.

Luckily, the wound wasn't deep; the bullet had just skimmed her skin.

The pool wasn't deep, but it was enough to break her fall.

Ignoring the pain from hitting the water, Amelia quickly climbed out and saw thick smoke everywhere and people running around in a panic.


To avoid the crazed crowd, she ran wildly and got separated from the bodyguards.

She was freaking out and terrified.

Amelia didn't care about anything else and planned to find a corner to hide in until the bodyguards found her. But then, she heard a familiar cry.
"Help, help! I'm not the one you're looking for, let me go! The person you're looking for is in room 103!" It was Stella.


She was being dragged down from upstairs by a man in black,her hair a mess. The guy was rough and strong, trying to force her into a black SUV.

Wasn't she with a man? How did she get caught?

Amelia got it instantly. Stella must have tried to pull something, but it backfired, and she got caught herself.

It was karma at its finest.

But if Stella fell into their hands, it wouldn't end well for her.

These terrorists had no morals, no pity for women, and didn't even see captives as human.


To them, Stella was just a trophy, a damn good one.

Plus, she was a very beautiful woman. Here, women were like guns and ammo,just resources to be traded.


If they captured her, she'd either die or suffer physical torture and various humiliations before being sold off to squeeze out her remaining value.


Amelia watched as Stella was about to be forced into the car, her expression complex and her heart racing.


If Stella died in such a horrible way and she had the chance to save her but didn't, her conscience would eat her alive.


She decided to save Stella.

Gritting her teeth, she pulled out her gun and shot the man in the back.
It wasn't her first time shooting. The first time was when Lucius took her to the shooting range, and she had to mentally prepare herself for a long time.


The bullet hit the guy's shoulder, making him scream in pain.

Amelia was thrilled; she had hit him!

But there was no time to celebrate. She quickly moved and hid behind the car.


At that moment, another man in black noticed Stella, his face lighting up with excitement.


He completely ignored his injured buddy and dragged Stella into the car.

Stella was in total despair, tears streaming down her face as she kept crying for help, but no one paid her any mind.

She deeply regretted it. She should've stayed in the room. In the chaos,she thought she could kill Amelia.

Ignoring Jared's advice, she had just stepped out when a stray bullet pierced her calf, causing blood to gush out. She had no chance to escape.

Now she had just escaped from one terrorist only to be caught by another.The man in black saw her and excitedly shouted that he had found a woman and wanted to enjoy her immediately.

No matter how much she struggled and screamed, it was useless,only adding to her pain.

The man in black overpowered her, and with blood flowing from her,she was close to death.
"Get off me! I'm not the one you're looking for! Get away!" The more she struggled, the more thrilled the man in black became. Suddenly, his hand touched her waist and tore off her clothes.


Stella felt a chill and was terrified, tears streaming down her face. At this moment, a gunshot rang out.

The smile on the man's face froze, and a spray of blood blossomed from his forehead.


Blood splattered all over Stella, the smell of iron filling the air.

Stella trembled in fear, tears streaming uncontrollably. Her heart pounded wildly, as if it would burst from her chest.

At that moment, she was filled with gratitude for the person who saved her. She even thought that no matter what the person asked for in return.she would give it, even if it meant all her money.

"Hey, are you okay? Can you get up?" Suddenly, a familiar voice sounded.

Stellalooked into a pair of cold eyes. It was Amelia.

How was she here? Why did she save her?

Stella stared at Amelia in shock, thinking she was dreaming, a nightmare.

"What are you idling for? Come with me!" Amelia shouted.

After experiencing all this horror, Amelia had forgotten to fear.

Stella, pale and trembling, tried to get up but fell to the ground. Amelia helped her up and noticed her leg was injured.

"I'll support you. Let's hide first," Amelia said coldly.
Looking at Amelia's calm face, Stella still seemed to be dreaming.

"Watch out!" As she was in a daze, Amelia suddenly pushed her,making her dodge a bullet.


Stella was scared out of her wits.

"You..." Her lips trembled, "Why did you save me?"

"Cut the crap and move." Amelia said,pulling her towards the stairwell.

Stella's leg throbbed with pain, blood flowing, but she had to grit her teeth and endure it.


Suddenly, she saw a gun pointed at Amelia's unprotected back.

In that moment. many thoughts flashed through Stella's mind. If Amelia died, it would be great.


Her brother's reputation would be cleared, and no one would laugh at the Spencer family anymore.

It was a huge temptation! Stella's blood boiled.


But this bitch had just saved her life. Stella's expression was extremely complex. Why did the person she looked down on the most have such magnanimity to save her life? While she could only use twisted thoughts to push the other towards death.

"Watch out!" Stella shouted as she pushed Amelia aside. The bullet hit her shoulder, causing a spray of blood and leaving a gaping wound.
###Chapter 90

Stella got knocked to the ground by the bullet, screaming in pain and struggling to breathe.

Amelia was in shock and couldn't believe her eyes.

"You all right?" She tried to help Stella up but found her covered in blood,with nowhere to grab.

Stela's face was ghostly pale, and she passed out within seconds.

Just then, footsteps echoed from a distance.

Amelia stood up, shielding Stella, her eyes sharp like a panther on the hunt.


"Ms. White? Is that you?" It was the bodyguard Chris had assigned to her.

Amelia felt a wave of relief. Finally, some backup! She and Stella were
quickly moved to a safer spot.

Amelia checked her watch; it was already nine. Chris still hadn't shown up.

"Ms. White, a lot of guests at the auction got hurt. The area outsideis sealed off, and the government forces have taken care of the terrorists," the bodyguard explained.

Amelia nodded and tried calling Chris, but no answer.

"Can you reach him?" Her voice was deep and serious.

She had a gut feeling this was more complicated and probably tied to Chris.

The bodyguards exchanged glances, staying silent.
Amelia knew worrying wouldn't help. She wanted to go find him but had no clue where to start.

Just as she was feeling lost, her phone rang; it was Chris.

"How are you?" His voice was urgent and worried.

Amelia felt a lump in her throat; hearing his voice was such a relief.

"All good here." She wiped her tears, "Come back as soon as you can."

"Are you crying? Did you hurt?" Chris sounded like he was driving; there was noise in the background.

"I'm fine, but Stella's hurt. Just get back here," she said.

After hanging up, Amelia turned her attention to Stella.

"Pleaseget the bullet out for her," she told the bodyguards.

"But we don't have anesthesia or tools," one of them said, looking troubled.

They knew Stella and were worried about being accountable if something went wrong.

"If we don't get the bullet out now, she'll die soon." Amelia's voice was firm, "Do it while she's out cold, don't waste time."


The bodyguards had no choice. They quickly discussed and then took out a short, sharp dagger to remove the bullet just as Stella woke up.

She was delirious from the pain, and seeing the dagger, she freaked out,"What are you doing?"

"Treating you," Amelia smiled, raising an eyebrow.
She felt a bit satisfied. If it weren't for Stella, those terrorists wouldn't have targeted her.


Now, letting her suffer a bit was payback.

"No, without anesthesia, it'll kill me! You bitch, you're trying to hurt me! I just helped you! Let me go!"

"Stop whining."


Two bodyguards held Stella down while another disinfected the dagger and started extracting the bullet.


Stella's body convulsed with pain, she screamed, rolled her eyes, and passed out again.


The bodyguards were seasoned veterans who had been through countless gunfights; handling such a wound was no big deal for them. But the pain,it was soul-piercing.


Stella kept passing out and waking up from the pain,feeling like she was dying.


"Amelia, I'm gonna kill you."

Amelia sat there, feeling relaxed, "Sure, I'll be waiting."

The pain was too much; Stella was almost lifeless and passed out again.

Half an hour later, Chris finally returned.

He looked like he'd just been through hell, with several knife wounds and his face pale as a ghost.

Amelia was concerned instinctively when she saw him.
"Quick, check him out," she called, helping him to the sofa.

Chris felt somewhat pleased, "Finally, you care about me."

Amelia rolled her eyes.

"What about you? Your shoulder's hurt, and you're soaked. What happened?" Chris frowned, locking eyes with her.

Amelia gave a cold smile and pointed to Stella, "Ask your sister what she did."


Chris's expression changed, and he didn't say a word.

His injuries weren't too bad, mostly just cuts, but he'd lost a lot of blood,soaking his clothes.

The bodyguard quickly found some sutures, and while stitching him up,Chris gritted his teeth without making a sound.

Amelia was a bit impressed.

But no matter how much she asked, he refused to tell her what happened.

Amelia stopped asking, figuring knowing more wouldn't help.

"Why is she here?" Chris asked after his wounds were treated.

Amelia raised an eyebrow and recounted what happened before long,leaving out the part where Stella caused trouble for her.

After all, they'd saved each other's lives, and she'dI already gotten her payback, so they were even.

Jared was also found and brought back. He wasn't too lucky either; while
looking for Stella, he got stabbed by someone hiding in the dark. But the wound wasn't deep, and he hid in the hallway for a long time until the government forces found him.


By now, the remaining threats outside had been cleared, and it was peaceful.

Stella woke up too, and seeingher boyfriend, she burst into tears, crying miserably and quietly.


Jared felt heartbroken and immediately called the best medical team in Celestria to treat her.


But Chris wasn't about to let Stella off the hook.

"Didn't I tell you to stay away from her?" His voice was cold and dark,sending chills down everyone's spine.

Stella's tears dropped again, "Chris, how can you treat me like this? I'm your sister,you..."

"I can disown you," Chris sneered.

Amelia watched this scene without any expression. Although her grudge with Stella was settled, she didn't want to get involved in their business.

Jared quickly stepped forward to protect Stella, "Mr. Spencer, we can compensate Ms. White for her emotional distress."

"She doesn't need it," Chris said coldly.

Amelia perked up, "No, in fact, I need it very much."

Chris shot her a look that said, "Don't you have enough money with me?Why are you so greedy?"
Amelia didn't care about his look.

Even though she could make money now, she wouldn't turn down free cash, and why let Stella off easily?

"Ms. White, how much do you want? Name your price," Jared said confidently.

Amelia thought about it, planning to ask for thirty million dollars,leaving room for negotiation, hoping to get at least twenty million.

But Chris beat her to it, "One hundred million dollars." He casually demanded a hundred million, much more ruthless than her.

Jared was stunned. Even if he was rich, a hundred million wasn't something he could just give away.

"Chris, seriously? That's too much! What does she need that much money for?" Stella gritted her teeth in anger, glaring at Amelia, hoping she'd speak up.


Amelia stood there with her arms crossed, expressionless, with no intention to step in.

Chris was fighting for her interests, and she wasn't dumb enough to stop him.


"Then three hundred million dollars, plus twenty percent of your family's share,"Chris sneered.
###Chapter 91

Jared's face turned sour instantly. "Twenty percent of the shares? They sure have some nerve!"


Stella chimed in, "No way, Chris. We're strapped for cash right now.We can't just pull a hundred million dollars out of thin air."

Even if they could, there was no way they'd hand it over to that witch,Amelia.

"Oh, really?" Chris raised an eyebrow and shot a look at Jared. "Is that how you see it too?"

Jared's face was tight, and after a moment of silence, he seemed to make up his mind. "Fine, I agree to the hundred million."

In his mind, losing money was a lot better than crossing Chris.

Soon enough, a hundred million dollars was wired to Amelia's account.

"You're a billionaire now. Aren't you gonna treat me to a meal?" Chris lounged back, his eyes driftng over Amelia's slender back.

She stood with her back to him, gazing out from the 88th floor, her long hair cascading over her shoulders, looking gorgeous.

"A billionaire at the cost of half my life, and you are shameless to ask me to treat you." Amelia turned around coolly and sat down in front of him.


"Have they figured out what happened this time?" she asked, munching on some fruit.


Chris pursed his lips, his voice cold. "I sent people out. We'll have answers
by tonight at the latest."

He paused and added, "Don't worry, this is downtown. No matter how powerful those criminals are, they don't have the courage toact wildly here.



He thought Amelia was worried about her safety.

Little did he know, Amelia was more curious about who the woman was that those people were after during the incident.

Chris got up and put his arm around her shoulder, leading her out. "Let's go grab a bite."


"What exactly happened back then, and who was the woman they were looking for? Chris, I know you know, and I don't want you to lie to me or hide anything." Sitting in the car, Amelia couldn't hold back her suspicion anymore.


"She was Larry Moore's lover. She ran away." Chris gave her a deep look,his gaze darkening. "This woman is from ouir country,very unusual,and Larry is crazy about her."

"Who's Larry?" Amelia asked, intrigued.

Chris lowered his eyes, thinking for a moment. "He's the behind-the-scenes boss of eighty percent of the underground casinos in Celestria. A very capable and powerful guy with a lot of connections."

"I see." Amelia was thoughtful.

Larry was so rich and powerful, why did his lover leave him?

"She must be charming," she said.
Chris raised an eyebrow. "A bit better than you. I've heard she embodies the beauty of our country, driving Larry nuts. He spent a fortune to buy the most famous building in Celestria for her and even planned to marry her,"

"But Larry wasn't charming enough to keep his beloved lover. He's a loser." Amelia elegantly sipped her coffee and spoke indifferently.

Chris was taken aback; he didn't expect her insight to be so remarkable.

Larry couldn't keep his lover. What about him?

He gazed pensively at Amelia. At this moment, the golden sunset lightly enveloped her, as if casting a golden radiance over her. His gaze lingered on her until she waved her hand in front of him a few times, snapping him out of it. He coughed to cover up his distraction.

"What are you thinking? Your eyes look weird." She walked over and leaned on the sofa chair, her slender hand resting on his shoulder,full of grace and allure.


Chris's eyes darkened, and he suddenly yanked her into his arms with a force that felt like iron clamps holding her tight.

"What the hell are you doing? Let go of me, you creep!" Amelia shouted,struggling in panic and glaring at him angrily when she got the chance.


Chris didn't get mad; instead, he laughed, the ice in his eyes melting,showing a side of him she hadn't seen before.


He sat up straight, just about to force a kiss on her when his phone rang.It was Ryder.

"Mr. Spencer, we've got the guy, but he's talking weird.I think you need
to come and question him yourself."

"Got it, send me the address," Chris said coldly, then turned to Amelia."
We've caught the culprit. Want to come with me to check it out?"

"Sure," Amelia said,slipping out of his arms.

That evening, they arrived at a rundown motel in the suburbs.

Ryder had locked the guy in the basemenit,which was dark and cramped.As soon as they walked in, they were hit with the strong scent of dust and a nasty smell of smoke.


Amelia covered her mouth and nose, following Chris inside.

She immediately saw a burly man tied to a sofa chair in the middle of the room.

The guy's face was covered in scars, his eyes swollen, and his neck,shoulders, and arms were all messed up,reeking of blood.

Amelia suppressed her disgust, still covering her mouth and nose.

"Wake him up," Chris ordered.

With a blank expression, Ryder walked over, grabbed the man's dirty hair,and slapped him hard twice.


With two loud smacks, the burly man lost two molars, his face swelling up even more.

He woke up, saw Ryder who had captured him, and gritted his teeth in anger,spouting curses,

But when he looked up and saw Amelia, he froze, then was shocked,
trembling as he said, "Molly, Molly."

He stared at Amelia, his gaze sharp, as if trying to pierce through her.

Amelia was very confused. What was this guy saying?

"What are you saying?" Chris glanced at the man, his body radiating cold air.


But the burly man still stared at Amelia, saying, "You must go back to Larry,or more people will be dragged into this, and more people will die."

Amelia understood the language of Celestria, but she didn't get the meaning of his words.

"Shut him up!" Chris ordered coldly. Then he took Amelia and walked out.

Amelia was puzzled, but through his attitude and the man's expression,she started to piece things together.


"We're heading back to our country tonight," Chris said through gritted teeth.


Amelia was more convincedof her thoughts, following him silently.

They booked the last flight of the day, drove to the airport overnight, with a total of three cars. They were in the middle one, the other two cars were full of bodyguards.

On the way, Chris kept holding her hand.

Amelía stayed silent.

She was thinking, how could it be such a coincidence that the woman who escaped from Larry looked so much like her?
She didn't dare to think further, afraid of discovering something more terrifying.

"Even you have someone you're scared of?" Amelia teased in a low voice,seeing him so tense.


"Scared of him? Me?" Chris sneered.

"We're almost at the airport, don't be nervous." Amelia tried to pull her hand out, but he held it tighter.

Amelia was helpless and didn't bother to struggle. She subconsciously glanced at the dark sky outside, feeling a storm was coming.


At the same time, she was also thinking, what kind of person could make someone as fearless as Chris so wary?
###Chapter 92

The roar of high-powered engines echoed through the valley just as Amelia finished speaking. A dozen motorcycles tore down the road, flanked by a fleet of black SUVs closing in like a predatory pack.
"Mr. Spencer, they’ve blocked the pass. Orders?" the lead bodyguard’s voice crackled over the intercom.
In a foreign land, they were outnumbered and operating in the shadow of local powers. The stakes were no longer just business; they were life and death.
"Break through," Chris commanded, his voice as cold as the wind whipping past the windows.
The drivers floored their gas pedals, the heavy vehicles vibrating with raw power as they forced their way through the initial line of obstacles. Tires screeched and metal groaned as the SUVs swerved and collided in a desperate dance of tactical maneuvering. The air was thick with the smell of burnt rubber and the underlying tension of an imminent clash.
Amelia had witnessed high-stakes situations with Lucius before, but she had always been a spectator. Now, caught in the eye of the storm, the reality was paralyzing. Beside her, Chris remained unnervingly calm, his features set in a mask of iron.
"Amelia, listen to me," Chris said, turning to her. "I’m moving you to the lead car. They’ll cover your exit while I handle the situation here."
Amelia’s eyes widened. "No! I’m not leaving you behind."
"This isn't a request," Chris’s voice dropped to a lethal frequency. "This isn't our territory, and I won't have you caught in the crossfire because you were too stubborn to move. You’re the target they want; without you here, I can move freely."
Amelia stared at him, her heart skipping a beat. In the flickering shadows of the car, he looked like a man prepared for any sacrifice. "Please," he added, the word carrying a rare weight of genuine concern.
Amelia finally nodded. She had children waiting at home; she couldn't let her emotions dictate a fatal mistake.
Chris opened the door and pushed her toward the waiting driver of the reinforced Bentley. "Get her out of here. Do not stop for anything," he ordered. The driver, the most skilled combatant in their detail, didn't hesitate. The car roared to life, speeding away into the night.
As the distance grew, Amelia watched Chris’s figure shrink in the rearview mirror. Her heart felt as though it were being torn from her chest. The terrorist leader had called her Molly—the name of Larry’s lost lover. Was this entire nightmare simply because she shared a face with a ghost?
She watched as the dark SUVs completely surrounded Chris’s position. A cold dread washed over her. He had used himself as the ultimate distraction to ensure her safety. The farther she got, the more the images of him standing alone against an army haunted her.
"Stop the car," she said, her voice barely a whisper.
The driver kept his eyes on the road. "Ms. White, we have to keep moving. Mr. Spencer’s plan only works if you’re safe."
"I said, stop the car!" Amelia’s voice was suddenly sharp, echoing with an authority that matched Chris’s.
The driver glanced at her in the mirror and felt a sudden chill. This wasn't the timid woman he had seen before. Her gaze was cold, her presence radiating a chilling, lethal resolve.
"Stop now, or I will take control of this vehicle myself," she declared, her hand moving with purpose.
The driver slammed on the brakes, the tires screaming against the asphalt. Before he could react, Amelia was out of the door and pulling him from the driver’s seat.
"Ms. White, this is suicide! You’re walking straight back into a trap!" the driver cried out, reaching for the door.
"Stand aside," Amelia commanded, her aura so powerful it forced the man to recoil. "I am not watching him die while I run."
She floored the gas, and the Bentley roared as it performed a high-speed U-turn. Her mind was a whirlwind of fear and adrenaline, but one thought was crystal clear: she was going back for Chris.
As she approached the site, she saw the dark clouds of men in black suits advancing. They had surrounded Chris’s remaining cars with effortless precision. Chris and his handful of men stood no chance against such overwhelming numbers.
Amelia pulled over at a vantage point and grabbed the night-vision binoculars from the glove box. In the eerie green light, she saw a white-haired man in a formal tailcoat stepping out of a vehicle, walking toward Chris with the poise of a gentleman attending a gala.
Chris sat on the hood of his car, casually watching the approach as if he were bored.
"Mr. Spencer, it’s been too long," the white-haired man said, his voice smooth and elegant despite the murderous intent of the armed men flanking him.
Chris didn't even look up. "What’s the matter, Larry? Did you run out of people to harass at home, or are you here to collect a toll?"
The man laughed, a sound that sent shivers down Amelia’s spine. "In this territory, Mr. Spencer, I collect everything."
###Chapter 93
The man with the striking white hair was Larry Moore. Though in his early forties, his meticulous self-care gave him the lean, sharp appearance of a man a decade younger. His clear blue eyes were like a frozen lake, reflecting a cold, predatory intelligence. In his tailored tailcoat, he looked every bit the old-school aristocrat, yet everyone in Celestria knew him as the silent architect of the region’s most formidable underground networks.
"Mr. Spencer," Larry began, his voice smooth but edged with steel. "We’ve had profitable dealings over the years, and I’ve overlooked much. But this time, you’ve crossed a line that cannot be ignored. You’ve taken something—someone—that belongs to me."
Larry didn't need to raise a hand for the tension to skyrocket. His presence alone was a threat. "Considering our history, I expected more discretion. Hand over the woman you took from my estate, or the consequences will be far more permanent than a lost business deal."
Inside the car, Chris sneered. "You’ve clearly lost your grip on reality, Larry. Do you honestly think I’d be interested in your domestic entanglements?"
Chris stepped out of the vehicle, his tall frame cutting a sharp silhouette against the dim light. He walked toward Larry with a slow, deliberate pace that radiated a lethal confidence.
Their rivalry was legendary, born on a racing track years ago where Larry had tried to sabotage Chris’s car to secure a win. Chris hadn't just survived; he had dominated, exposing Larry’s desperation to the world. Since then, Larry had been a shadow in Chris’s professional life, sabotaging deals and waiting for a moment to reclaim his pride.
"You want to settle this now?" Chris looked at him with a faint, mocking smile. "Everyone knows you’re ruthless, Larry, but I’m the only one who remembers you’re a coward when the lights are on. No matter how much power you amass, you’ll always be the man who couldn't win fairly."
Larry’s face turned a deep shade of crimson. He stepped forward, the air between them thick with the promise of violence. "One word from me, and your story ends here," Larry snarled, his eyes fixed on Chris.
Chris didn't flinch. "Then say the word. Or move aside."
Larry hesitated. He knew Chris had deep ties to the Spencer Group and international interests that even his own father, Ethan Moore, respected. To strike Chris here would be to invite a war that the Moore family might not survive.
"What’s the matter? No audience to cheat for today?" Chris sneered, turning his back to return to his car.
Larry let out a roar of frustration, the sound echoing through the valley. "Chris! I can compromise on markets and diamonds, but not on this. You must return my associate!"
"Larry, you're treading on thin ice," Chris turned back, his voice dropping to a bloodthirsty coldness that made the surrounding guards hesitate. "I visited your father when I arrived in Celestria. We reached an understanding regarding the Eldoria market. He showed me respect. Do you really want to be the one to break that peace?"
Larry’s hands trembled. The mention of his father, the only man he truly feared, was a calculated strike. "You think using his name will save you?"
"I think he values profit over your personal vendettas," Chris replied icily.
Just as the stand-off reached its breaking point, the screech of tires tore through the silence. A solitary car sped toward them, stopping abruptly in the center of the clearing.
Amelia stepped out of the driver’s seat, her figure bathed in the harsh glare of the headlights. Chris’s eyes narrowed in disbelief. Why was she back?
"Molly!" Larry cried out, his expression shifting from rage to a twisted kind of relief. "You’ve come back. Step away from him, and I can overlook this lapse in judgment."
"Stop this!" Amelia shouted, her voice cold and commanding. She saw Chris surrounded, the tension palpable, and her only thought was to break the siege.
"Molly, don't tell me you’ve developed feelings for him in such a short time," Larry mocked, a sneer returning to his lips. "Everyone here has seen it—Chris took what was mine. Now, I have every justification to settle our debt once and for all."
Amelia stood her ground between the two men, her presence a fragile shield in a world of monsters.

###Chapter 94
"Larry!" A low, lethal voice cut through the air. Larry spun around to find Chris staring at him with eyes that could cut through steel.
Chris’s gaze was icy and merciless, a look Larry had only seen in the eyes of his father, Ethan Moore. It was the look that preceded the most brutal family punishments.
"If you lay a finger on her, I’ll ensure that everything you’ve built in this city crumbles to ash," Chris growled, each word saturated with menace.
Larry’s throat tightened. Ethan had always warned him: Never corner someone who has nothing to lose. At this moment, Chris looked exactly like that man—desperate and dangerous.
"A bold claim for someone surrounded by my men," Larry sneered, though his pace toward Amelia slowed. He studied her, realizing she wasn't his Molly. Molly was brave, but she was selfish; she would never risk her life for anyone. This woman, however, possessed a different kind of fire.
Amelia’s heart was hammering against her ribs, but she stood her ground. If the night was to end in tragedy, she would at least face it beside Chris.
"So, you’re the infamous Larry Moore," Amelia said, stepping forward with her arms crossed. "I expected a visionary. Instead, I see a man who uses shadows because he’s afraid of the light. No wonder Molly preferred a life without you."
Larry’s eyes darkened, his gaze raking over her with an arrogant, possessive intensity. "You’re far more interesting than she was. Perhaps I’ll keep you instead."
Amelia let out a cold, hollow laugh. She unzipped her jacket, revealing a complex arrangement of wires and canisters strapped around her midsection—a salvaged tactical device that looked terrifyingly functional in the dim light.
A collective gasp went up. Even Larry instinctively retreated a step.
"Amelia! What are you doing?" Chris’s voice cracked with disbelief and fear.
Ryder and the assistants were frozen. The woman they had once dismissed now stood before them as a fearless, desperate force of nature.
Amelia pulled a small, black device from her pocket, her thumb hovering over the activation switch. "I don’t care about your legacy or your feuds, Mr. Moore. But if I press this, the Moore family’s line ends right here, along with us."
In that moment, she was breathtakingly detached, a thorny rose standing firm in a lethal storm. Her madness was her shield.
Larry squinted, a strange mix of hatred and admiration flashing in his blue eyes. He slowly raised his hands in a gesture of mock surrender. "Amelia, isn't it? You’re stunning. Leave Chris. Stay with me, and I’ll make you the queen of Celestria."
"I’d rather be a ghost than your queen," Amelia retorted. She took a step forward, her eyes locking onto his. "I’ll count to three. Either we all leave this valley together, or no one leaves at all."
Larry’s face twisted. He searched for a sign that she was bluffing, but all he saw was a woman who had reached her breaking point. "You’re insane..."
"One."
The surrounding guards began to back away, the threat of an immediate, catastrophic explosion overriding their loyalty to Larry.
"Two."
"Wait!" Larry shouted, the desperation finally bleeding into his voice. He realized that if she was even half as crazy as she looked, his life was seconds away from ending.
"Three is a long way down, Mr. Moore," Amelia whispered, her finger tensing on the switch.
"Fine! Let them go!" Larry roared, waving his hand frantically at his men.
The wall of black suits parted like a receding tide. Amelia’s heart finally skipped a beat as the immediate pressure lifted, but she didn't lower her hand. She walked toward Chris, her steps slow and deliberate.
Every step felt like a lifetime. Her back was soaked with cold sweat, and her legs were trembling, but she didn't let her mask slip until she reached Chris’s side.
Chris met her with a look of intense heartache. He didn't say a word, simply guiding her into the car as he ordered the driver to floor it.
As the Bentley sped into the darkness, Amelia saw Larry’s shadow in the distance, a silent promise of future vengeance. She leaned into Chris’s arms, the adrenaline finally leaving her body and leaving a crushing exhaustion in its wake.
"Don't move," Chris’s voice was hoarse as he helped her settle into the seat. "I can’t believe you did that. Where did you even find that... that thing?"
Amelia closed her eyes, tears finally streaming down her face. She reached into her pocket and pulled out the remote—a simple, broken garage door opener she had found in the debris by the road.
"It’s fake, Chris," she whispered, her voice shaking. "I found the canister set in the trunk of the car—abandoned, wires cut. It was just a prop. I just... I had to make them believe."
Chris pulled her close, his heart racing against hers. He had faced armies and corporate wars, but nothing had ever terrified him as much as seeing Amelia risk everything on a lie to save him.

###Chapter 95
"What?" Chris looked at her, stunned into a rare silence.
Amelia’s facade finally crumbled, tears streaming down her face. "I was terrified, Chris. I didn't think it would actually work."
"It was brilliant... and utterly reckless," Chris whispered, a mixture of pride and lingering fear for her safety boiling within him. He pulled her into his arms, but this time his touch was cautious, as if she were made of glass. He realized that beneath her cold exterior lay a woman capable of daring anything for him.
By the time they reached the private jet, Amelia had fallen into an exhausted, deep sleep. Chris watched her, his heart swelling. She had risked everything on a bluff, a masterpiece of deception.

Amelia woke up in her own bed, the familiar scents of home grounding her. Her body felt heavy and sore, memories of the confrontation with Larry flickering like scenes from a fever dream. As she moved to sit up, she noticed a figure beside her.
Chris was asleep in a chair by the bed, his head resting on his hand. Amelia was genuinely surprised; the proud CEO of the Spencer Group had never looked so vulnerable.
"You're awake," Chris murmured, his eyes opening instantly. "Do you need anything? Water?"
Amelia shook her head, her voice still thin. "Why are you here, Chris?"
"You shouldn't have to face the aftermath alone," he said, getting up to pour her a glass. "Consider it a gesture from someone who plans on staying around."
Amelia accepted the water, her silence speaking volumes. "When are we going back to the island? Victor will be furious if he finds out I left without permission."
"We’re going home," Chris said, taking her hand. "The island was a sanctuary, but it's time to face the reality of Pinecrest. I’m here. I won't let him sideline you again."
Despite her reservations, Amelia found comfort in his presence. Her heart was slowly gravitating toward him, a fact that both comforted and terrified her.

The return to Pinecrest was far from quiet. News that Chris had prioritized his personal life over his executive position at the Spencer Group was the talk of the town. Amelia’s gallery reopened with more attention than ever, but the social scrutiny was stifling.
A few days later, Sophia brought Owen to visit. The boy clung to Amelia, his eyes filled with a maturity that broke her heart. "Be careful, Mom," he whispered before Sophia hurried him away, fearing Chris might arrive and see the resemblance.
Amelia decided she couldn't hide forever. She needed to face Victor and offer her apologies. However, the first person she encountered at the Spencer Mansion was Stella, being pushed in a wheelchair by Jared.
"Look who decided to crawl back," Stella sneered, her voice full of its usual venom. "Amelia or Bella—whatever you’re calling yourself today—do you really think you have a place here? You’ve missed your window. Leila has already been solidified as the future of this family."
Amelia ignored the taunt and walked toward Victor’s study. The man she found there looked haggard, the vitality of his military years finally fading under the weight of family scandal and illness.
"Grandpa, I’m back," Amelia said softly, keeping her head down.
Victor sighed, beckoning her closer. "I’m glad you’re safe, child. But tell me, what is your intention now? After everything that has happened..."
"I can't be what he needs, Grandpa," Amelia replied, her heart heavy. "It’s better for everyone if I keep my distance."
"Matters of the heart follow their own destiny, Amelia," Victor said, his voice weary. "You can try to fight it, but respect the path it takes."
As she left the study, the living room was no longer empty. Diana and Leila were there, huddled with Stella.
"Stop right there," Diana commanded, her voice cold. "Do you think being a 'friend' of my son entitles you to ignore the etiquette of this house? You should show respect to your elders."
Amelia turned, her expression neutral. "Mrs. Spencer, respect is earned, not demanded by title alone. I don't consider myself beneath your son, nor do I consider your approval necessary for my peace of mind."
Diana’s face flushed with anger. "You’ve seduced him into making reckless decisions, and yet you stand there with such arrogance! My son already has a partner who understands the value of this family."
She gestured toward Leila, who stood up with a triumphant smile. "Ms. White, it’s only fair you know. Our engagement is being finalized. I’ll be sure to send you an invitation to the gala. It’s the least I can do for an old acquaintance."
Amelia’s back stiffened, but she didn't give them the satisfaction of a reaction. She walked out of the mansion, the battle lines clearly drawn.

###Chapter 96

Amelia didn't even bat an eye. "Sure, just send it straight to my gallery."

Diana was irritated by how chill Amelia was and stepped right in front of her. "Who the hell are you?"

Everyone was thinking the same thing.

But no one had the guts to ask.

After all, if she really was Amelia, that would be terrifying.

"Sorry, I gotta bounce." Amelia glanced at her watch. "Mrs.Spencer,I have no time or energy to waste on you."

"Your silence says it all-you're Amelia," Diana said firmly, just like she always did.


Amelia turned to look at her. "Speak for yourself."

Four days later, Amelia got an invitation, hand-delivered by Leila.

At that time, Amelia was downstairs showing some paintings to an overseas buyer when Leila walked in, all dressed up and smiling like a lady.


By the time Amelia had seen off the buyer, Leila was already getting impatient waiting nearby.


"Ms. White's paintings are truly valuable. Just a few hours of random painting and some chit-chat, and you can sell it for four million dollars."

"Thanks for the compliment." Ameia sat down casually. "Ms. Ross isn't bad either. Just get someone to ghostwrite a song, and the money you
make could last an ordinary person several lifetimes."

Leila's face turned red with anger. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

Amelia raised an eyebrow and smiled. "What brings you here today? Don't tell me you came just to argue with me."

Leila suppressed her anger and pulled out a sapphire blue invitation from her expensive designer bag. The embossed design on it was quite unique.

Amelia opened it casually and saw a photo of a couple printed on it.

To be fair, Leila and Chris made a good match when it came to looks.

Amelia smiled. "I'll play it by ear."

Leila said,"Ms. White, you should come. Otherwise, I'll think you really are Amelia."


After Leila left, Amnelia took the invitation upstairs and tossed it to Chris,who was sitting on the couch playing video games on a big screen.

"Your fiancée came to provoke me. What do you think about that?" She crossed her arms, her tone a bit impatient.


Chris picked up the invitation, glanced at it, and tossed it into the trash."Ignore her."

Amelia sneered inwardly. He was about to get engaged, yet he said to ignore Leila. What did it mean that he kept coming over and hanging around her place?

"Wait, are you mad?" Chris turned off the game and pulled her into his arms, a smile playing on his lips. "She's just a prop. She doesn't affect your status.What are you afraid of?"
Amelia scoffed. "Status? What status? And why does Mr. Spencer think I would accept the so-called status you're offering?"

"You won't accept it?" Chris looked at her helplessly. "Fine,then.You can give me a title. I won't mind."

"Go away." Amelia pushed him away irritably.

She didn't know why, but Leila's provocation had never bothered her before. Today,though, it really got under her skin.

"Just don't go. There's no need to get mad at me because of her." Chris stood up. trying to hug her, but she dodged him swiftly. He stretched out his legs to block her path. "Don't be like this. Come here."

Amelia grabbed his chin and pushed him away forcefully. "I'm tired and I'm off work. Stay if you want."

Soon, it was the day of Leila and Chris's engagement.

That day, Amelia invited Sophia, Owen, and her assistant Wendy over for dinner.


"Cheers." They all raised their glasses, clinking them together in a casual toast as they enjoyed a simple dinner together.

"Mom, try this fish. It's really good." With Wendy around, Owen called Sophia "Mom."

Sophia ruffled Owen's hair. "Thank you, my sweetie."

If he kept being this adorable and sweet to her, she might actually want to have a child.

"Bella, you don't look very happy." Owen noticed Amelia's expression and
gave her a piece of rib. "You should eat more. You and Mom are both too skinny. It's not healthy."

Amelia was slightly taken aback, then smiled.

Even though the people she cherished were around her today,she still felt an emptiness inside.

"I'll go get some drinks from the kitchen." She stood up, and Sophia followed her.


"Are you upset because of Chris?" Sophia asked bluntly.

Amelia had just opened the fridge when her back stiffened. She waved her hand with a smile. "No, it's nothing."

"I feel like something's off with you." Sophia sighed. "Ever since you came back from abroad, you haven't been yourself. Don't tell me you've actually fallen for Chris."


Amelia was about to respond when the doorbell rang.

Owen ran to open the door, only to see a pair of long legs.

Looking up, he saw a strikingly handsome face-his bastard dad.

Owen frowned. "What are you doing here? You're not welcome."

Chris quietly studied Owen, finding his features increasingly familiar.

"Oh, what are you doing here?" He reached out to pat Owen's shoulder, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

Owen glared at him, gritting his teeth. "None of your business."
He had to stand firmly by his mom's side, protect her, and reject this unfit father.

"Chris?" Amelia walked out, her expression complicated upon seeing Chris.
"Is the engagement party over already?"

Chris raised an eyebrow at her, then pushed past Owen and stepped inside.

Owen didn't want to let him have his way and tried to trip him. Chris's face darkened. "Brat, move, I donI't want to hit a kid."

As he spoke, he caught the aroma of the food and reckoned he had arrived just in time to join them.

"We're having dinner and didn't prepare any for you. Please leave."Amelia pushed Owen towards Sophia and turned to the living room.

Chris, however, made himself at home. "I'm hungry too. I'll just make do with whatever's here."

"No way." Amelia was furious. "You should be where you fit in."

"This is where I fit in," Chris smirked, looking at Amelia's angry face with appreciation, suddenly reminded of the shocking performance she had given him that night.

Amelia was a woman of many faces.

Good, very good. He liked her even more.

"Please leave." Owen stepped forward, standing in front of his mom. "It's rude to barge into someone else's home, especially when none of us welcome you."

Though he was small, he had an inexplicable presence. Every move and
word carried a maturity beyond his years, faintly reminiscent of Chris.
###Chapter 97

"Owen, come here," Sophia urged, trying to pull Owen away.But he stood firm,his voice cold. "Mom, Aunt Bella's been a big help to us.I like her,and I'm not gonna let anyone treat her badly."

"Come with me," Amelia said, worried Chris might catch on. She dragged him outside and slammed the door shut.

Chris sneered down at her, "What, too crowded in there? You want a private chat?"

Amelia glared at him, her words biting, "What are you trying to pull?Today was supposed to be your engagement day with Leila. She even sent out the invites. And you missed your engagement to come here and be with your sex partner? What's your deal?"

"I never agreed to the engagement. If she wants to get engaged, she can do it herself," Chris said, gripping her shoulders a bit tightly. "Besides, I never saw you as just a sex partner."

"But to me, that's all you are," Amelia snapped back, her anger making her words sting. "We have no real relationship. If you keep hanging around me, people will think I seduced you!"

She was truly furious.

Chris, however,just looked at her quietly, finding her anger and frustration oddly charming.

He was completely smitten.

"You've been seducing me all along," he said, pulling her into his arms. "You can't deny it."
Crazy!

"Chris," a soft voice called out just as the elevator doors opened.

Amelia stiffened and looked over to see Leila.

Leila was dressed in a stunning red mermaid gown, adorned with expensive jewelry, looking perfect from head to toe.

But her eyes were filled with deep sorrow and pain.

"Chris, please come back with me. Every guest was there. If you don't come back. I'll be the laughingstock of the whole Pinecrest. Don't you care at all about how people will see me?"

Leila's tears were heart-wrenching.

She was truly a master of her craft, every cell in her body exuding top-notch acting skills.


But to Amelia, the scene was nothing but ironic.

Her heart felt heavy, and her nose stung with an inexplicable ache.

"I told you, if you want to get engaged, that's your business. I won't stop you,but I won't be there either," Chris said, his voice as cold as ever.


"What? How can that be? Everyone is waiting. I even invited friends from the entertainment industry. They're all waiting for you..."

"That's your problem," Chris said, turning away with a cold expression,unwilling to show her any kindness.

Leila's tears flowed freely, "Chris, you can't be so cruel to me.You know how long I've waited for this day. I can't live without you."
Chris remained unmoved.

Leila then turned her gaze to Amelia.

"Ms. White, I'm begging you. Please help me convince Chris. Today is our engagement day. I've staked all my dignity on this. If he doesn't come,I'll be humiliated to death."

At that moment, Leila's desperate plea reminded Amelia of herself years ago, begging her father in the rain not to plead with Chris.

But back then, Chris cared about Leila.

How had things changed so much in just a few years?

Amelia's feelings were a tangled mess.

But she had no reason to sympathize with Leila.

She didn't want to play the saint.

"Both of you, please leave," Amelia said, taking a deep breath and opening the door to go back inside.


But Chris grabbed her hand, his gaze intense, as if silently asking, "Are you really going to leave me?"


"Chris, can you stop being so irresponsible? You promised her an engagement, to give her a status. Today is the day to fulfill that promise.I have no interest in being a stepping stone in your relationship," Amelia said, unable to hold back any longer. She glared at him and yanked her hand away.

She decided to change the locks later.
"What do you mean by that?" Chris suddenly erupted in anger,staring straight into her eyes. "Are you saying you don't care about me? Then why did you come back to save me?"

Amelia was momentarily speechless.

At that time, she must have been crazy.

He had let her leave first, staying behind to cover their retreat, so she had softened.


Or maybe she hadn't completely forgotten him and couldn't bear to watch him die?


Her mind was a chaotic mess, and she couldn't sort it out.

"Answer me!" Chris demanded, gripping her shoulders, his teeth clenched.

Amelia, being pushed to her limit, blurted out, "Because I didn't want to owe you anything. I didn't want you to cling to me!"

In the end, Chris left with Leila.

That night, rumors spread that they had successfully completed their engagement ceremony.

And Amelia became part of the gossip, with many people saying she was an unworthy mistress, that her ex-boyfriend was Lucius, but for some reason, she insisted on being with Chris.

Amelia felt no emotional response to such trivial talk.

She didn't care.

However, the incident did affect her gallery, with fewer and fewer visitors,
and no customers for three to five days.

Amelia wasn't worried. She simply stayed at home, occasionally cooking a meal with Sophia and Owen, enjoying their time together.

One weekend, Sophia had something to do and left Owen with Amelía to take care of.


Coincidentally, Shawn was also there.

Shawn had just returned from abroad, bringing some photos of Olivia.

He had heard about Chris and Leila's engagement and was quite surprised.

"Didn't you come back to win him over? How did you let Leila get engaged to him?"


Amelia couldn't take her eyes off her daughter's photos, reluctant to put them down. "It's good that they're engaged. I was worried he'd keep bothering me."


Shawn raised an eyebrow and smiled, "Well, it's the weekend. Let's take Owen to the amusement park my family just opened, and it's got a lot of fun attractions."


Amelia looked at Owen,who shyly nodded.

So they all went out to have some fun.

After a joyful time at the amusement park, Amelia picked up Wendy,and they all went to a mall for dinner.

"The dishes here are mostly spicy. We should order a few mild ones for Owen," Wendy suggested with a smile.
"Thank you, Ms. Brown," Owen said, his lips pressed together like a little adult.


A table full of exquisite dishes was soon served. Amelia ate quite a bit and had a couple of drinks, getting a litle tipsy.

"I heard you've been having a rough time lately," Shawn said quietly,watching her and sighing.

Amelia's smile froze, and she waved her hand, "Isn't that normal? I'm not a lucky person. It's always like this."

Shawn's eyes showed a hint of pity.

Amelia downed another glass, but in her haste, she choked and started coughing.

"Alright, that's enough," Shawn said, quickly getting up to pat her back.
###Chapter 98

Owen copied his moves,getting up to help Amelia catch her breath. "Bella,put the drink down. We gotta head back."

"Amelia!" A cold shout suddenlycut through the air.

Amelia froze.

She knew that voice. It was Chris.

Before she could even turn around, Chris stormed over, grabbed Shawn by the collar, and threw him to the ground.

Shawn,totally caught off guard, crashed into a dining chair with a loud bang.

Everyone else was stunned, and Amelia's angerflared up.

"What the hell are you doing?" She glared at Chris and rushed to help Shawn.


"Who is he to you? You ignored my calls to have dinner with him. I called you over ten times!" Chris's voice was full of rage, his eyes burning with intensity.


"Calm down. This is a public place, not your home." Amelia noticed his bad mood and softened her tone, trying to calm him down.


But just then, Shawn coughed, clutching his chest. Amelia instinctively looked at him and asked quietly, "Are you okay? I'll take you to the hospital later."

Shawn shook his head without speaking, but a slight smirk appeared on
his lips as he looked down.

Chris noticed this detail.

He couldn't hold back.

"Shawn, you're asking for it!" He stepped forward, gripping Shawn's shoulder tightly. "You better stay away from her!"

"She's not your possession. She's a person, a free person." Shawn's voice grew serious. "Chris, do you even know her? Do you care about her? Have you ever truly respected her?"

Chris's anger intensified.

What did these questions mean?

"And you do?" He sneered, a murderous glint in his eyes. "You should know that being close to her puts you and your family in danger."

Shawn spread his hands. "I'm not afraid. You're just that kind of person,acting recklessly and choking others at will. Isn't that just impotent rage?"

His words deeply provoked Chris.

Amelia was also shocked,"Stop it!"

Everyone around them stared in astonishment, shocked by the scene.

Amelia didn't want to become the subject of gossip, nor did she want to drag Shawn into this. "Take Owen and go. I'll follow soon."

Shawn raised an eyebrow and smiled, obediently taking Owen's hand and heading out.
"Stop!" Chris sneered. "This is my last warning. Stay away from her!"

His anger was at its peak.

But Shawn wasn't one to back down.

"I won't." He smirked again. "Others might fear you, but I don't."

"Nice." Chris's eyes were filled with murderous intent, his presence overwhelming, as if he would devour Shawn the next second.

"You're a bad man!" At that moment, Owen, furious with his father,kicked him to avenge Shawn.

"Get out of the way!" Chris, enraged, pushed Owen aside. Owen tripped over a chair leg and fell, cutting his hand on a broken plate, blood gushing out instantly.


Amelia's face turned pale. "Owen, are you okay?"

Seeing his bloody hand, Amelia's heart ached. She stood up and slapped Chris acoss the face. "Are you satisfied now? You lunatic!"

"Let's go. There's a hospital nearby." Shawn quickly picked up Owen and ran out.


Amelia followed quickly, and they soon vanished from Chris's sight.

He stood there, staring after them, his heart tightening.

Was he really this pathetic?

He was so obsessed with that woman that he couldn't even tell if she was Amelia or Bella anymore.
But why was she so worried about that kid?

He had seen it clearly. When Owen got hurt, Amelia's face turned pale.like her world had just crumbled.

In all this time, no matter what happened, she had never been so worried.

And they seemed really close.

Chris suddenly calmed down.

He thought back to various strange occurrences from the past and felt something was off.

He immediately called his assistant.

"Find out who that kid with Amelia is."




At the hospital, the doctor quickly checked Owen and started stitching him up. Owen was surprisingly calm and not scared at all.

"Owen, I'm so sorry. I didn't manage to protect you." Amelia was heartbroken, her eyes welling up.

Owen hugged her arm, looking seriously into her eyes. "Mom, it's not your fault. It's Dad's. How could he do that? He abandoned you, mistreated you,and now he's mistreating Mr. Jones and everyone around me. I hate him."

Amelia felt helpless.

She had never talked to Owen about Chris's character, but at his age, Owen had already learned to read people.
In just a few encounters with Chris, he had seen through him.Who knew what the future would hold...

No,they wouldn't have a future together.

Chris was engaged and would soon have his own family and kids.

Owen and Olivia could never be known to him.

"What's your next step?" Shawn asked. "How's Olivia doing? Is she feeling any better?"


Amelia's face stiffened slightly, remembering her video call with Olivia the night before.

Olivia had said she missed Amelia and Owen and didn't want to continue treatment. She just wanted to be with her family, even if it meant she wouldn't live long.

Amelia's heart had shattered.

She had never felt guilty about her kids, but in that moment, she felt like the worst mother in the world.


"I will find a way to save Olivia." Amelia gritted her teeth. "I've been actively taking care of my health lately. Next time, I must get pregnant successfully, and then I'll leave him."




That afternoon, Lucius's assistant, Sable, suddenly called.

"Amelia, Owen's biological information was collected again. Damn it, who is this twisted person? Have they figured something out? Why won't they leave you alone? I'm so fed up." Sable's voice was filled with frustration.
Amelia stood up abruptly. "What?"

Her face turned pale, and a thought popped into her head. It was Chris.

He was suspicious of Owen's identity.

Amelia panicked. If he found out, the consequences would be unimaginable.


She immediately called Lucius and explained everything.

Lucius remained calm, telling her to stay calm and that he would handle it.

Only then did Amelia's heart settle.

But she didn't know that they all had been played by Chris.
###Chapter 99

Chris made the first move. He sent someone to the preschool to quietly grab some of Owen's hair and a used tissue, then shipped them off to a lab for paternity test. He made sure Amelia got the info.

As Chris expected, Amelia reached out to Lucius, the only guy in Pinecrest who could handle this on the down low.

But they had no clue that Chris's real motive wasn't about the paternity test results.


"Mr. Spencer, Lucius's team has made their move," Ryder said softly as he walked into the study. "They've also swapped out Owen's test items, What should we do next?"

Chris stayed quiet for a moment, then suddenly stood up. Ignorng Ryder's question, he headed straight to the garage and drove off.

He floored it all the way to Amelia's place. But just as he was about to get out of the car,he hesitated.


He didn't know what she was up to, why she wouldn't come clean, or why she kept hiding her true self.

But she must have her reasons.

Shawn was right about one thing: Chris didn't really get Amelia,nor did he know how to respect her.

He should wait for the day she'd willingly tell him everything.

The next morning, Amelia slept in for the first time, waking up around ten.
She heard noises from the kitchen and thought a burglar had broken in.
Rushing downstairs, she found something worse than a burglar.

"Why are you here?" she exclaimed, staring at Chris's busy back in shock.

Chris was making tomato sauce, clearly struggling, cursing under his breath, with a tablet playing a cooking tutorial beside himn. It was her tablet,now splattered with tomato sauce.


"Cooking," Chris replied without turning around, focused on the sauce.

A loud sizzle followed as oil and diced tomatoes splattered everywhere,making a mess of the stove.

Chris hurried to turn off the heat but accidentally turned it up, causing a plume of black smoke to rise.

Amelia, alarmed, pulled him away, turned off the stove, opened the vent,and aired out the kitchen.


When she finally turned to look at him, she couldn't help but laugh.

The usually composed Chris was now standing there with a bewildered expression. She sighed, "Mr. Spencer, are you doing performance art?"

Chris's face was already darkened, somewhat angry, "I don't know how to cook.Do you?"


It was the first time he had thrown such a childish tantrum.

Amelia cleaned up the kitchen, took out fresh ingredients, and made tomato sauce spaghetti for him, having heard his stomach growling.

Chris initially thought she was mocking him, but within twenty minutes,she had a plate of spaghetti ready.
The aroma hit him before he even saw the dish,a rich,tangy scent.

"Here you go," Amelia said,setting the plate in front of him. She chuckled,"I can't believe a big-shot CEO like you would cook. It's kinda funny."

Chris took a bite, planning to just taste it, but the flavor was so good it made him forget to respond to her teasing.

Halfway through, he noticed she wasn't eatingand asked. "Why aren't you eating?"

Amelia smiled, "I don't usually have spaghetti for breakfast. I made oatmeal.Want some?"

Chris said,"No,thanks."

He quickly finished the spaghetti, even eating it clean.

"Is it that good?" Amelia was surprised. She hadn't expected her cooking to impress Chris.

She knew he was super picky, often refusing to eat at events if he didn't like the food. Victor had even arranged a team of top chefs for him,ready to cook gourmet meals at any time.

Who would've thought a simple spaghetti would win his approval?

He even cleaned the plate, showving how much he enjoyed it.

"Just okay," Chris said nonchalantly, glancing at her and noticing her smiling eyes, which caught him off guard.

"Alright, you've had breakfast and made a mess of the kitchen. Time for you to go," Amelia said,trying to get him to leave.
But Chris stayed put. "I'm waiting for lunch. Grandpa kicked me out, froze all my assets. and I don't have a penny. You wouldn't let me be homeless,would you?"


Amelia was shocked. "What happened? Did you upset Mr. Victor Spencer again? Is he okay?"


Chris raised an eyebrow. "You care about him a lot. Why don't you ask if I got beaten up or hurt?"

"Did you?" Amelia's brows furrowed as she looked him over, noticing his left hand hanging limply.

"Yeah." Chris said, almost jokingly. "Grandpa was really mad and hit me with his cane. My wrist hurts."

"Really?" Amelia instinctively stepped closer, staring into his eyes. "Swear you're not lying.

Chris glared at her. "Not only did I get beaten, but I also went hungry for a day and a night. You're really heartless, not even asking about me...What are you doing?"

Before he could finish, Amelia stepped forward, gently holding his hand. "Does it hurt?"


Her soft, fragrant touch made his heart melt.

He shook his head, "Who am I? Such a small injury is nothing to me."

But when Amelia rolled up his sleeve, she saw his arm was swollen.

"You need to go to the hospital," she said, quickly changing and dragging him out.
Watching her serious profile as she drove.Chris's gaze softened.

"You're worried about me," he said with a sly smile. "You really love me but refuse to admit it."


Amelia stayed silent.

How could Chris be so confident?

They soon arrived at the hospital. The doctor ran a full check-up and found several old wounds that hadn't healed properly, but they were now infected and causing a fever.
###Chapter 100

Chris acted like it was no big deal, like the injury was on someone else.

The doctor said he should stay in the hospital for observation to avoid any complications.


But Chris was dead set on going home with her,griping about the hospital s smell and the crazy cost per day, which he couldn't afford since he was broke.


Amelia was speechless.

"Ill pay for it," she offered.

Chris shot back, "Who are you to pay for me?"

Amelia fell silent.

Fine, let him find someone else to pay then.

She turned to leave, but he grabbed her arm, "Just get me some medicine.I'Il take it at home."


Amelia couldn't argue with him.

Not wanting to leave him alone, she reluctantly took him home.

As a result, she couldn't go to the gallery anymore and had to take care of him,cooking three meals a day.

Luckily, her cooking skills had improved over the years,so he didn't suspect her identity.

That night, just as she fell asleep, he came into her room.
Amelia woke up instantly, looking at him warily, "What do you want?"

Chris didn't bother with excuses this time. He pulled back her blanket and climbed in beside her.


Amelia realized he was ice-cold and trembling.

Was he running a fever again?

"What happened to you? I'll get you some medicine," she said.

But Chris wrapped his arms around her waist, holding her tightly like a doll, "Don't go."

He just needed to sleep.

After a while, his body started to heat up, and he began to sweat.

They were pressed so close together that their bodies seemed to merge. At that moment, he was turned on and leaned in to kiss her.

His kisses, once fierce and stormy, were now soft and disoriented.

Amelia, though she wanted his sperm, didn't want to take advantage of him.


"Don't push yourself. You're in no condition for this," she tried to push him away, but he held her tighter.

Amelia sighed, "My body can't handle this right now. Stop it!"

Chris froze, then collapsed beside her, falling into a dazed sleep.

Meanwhile, at the Spencer Mansion.

Diana sat on the couch, glaring at Leila in front of her.
"I've helped you so many times, and you still can't get it. I've given you multiple chances, and you keep blowing it. No wonder Chris is distracted by other women. You're driving me crazy!"

Leila, too scared to argue, kept her head down and finally said,"Mrs.Spencer, I'm sorry. It's my fault, but he..."

"He's gone to that tramp again, hasn't he? We teamed up to comnplain to his father, and he got a good scolding. But instead of behaving,he moved in with that tramp. How can there be such shameless women in the world?Out of all the men, she had to seduce my son?"

Diana was getting more and more furious.

Leila was also seething with anger, but there was nothing she could do.She wasn't Amelia; she didn't have her looks or her cunning.

"But you're his fiancée, his legitimate girlfriend. How can you let some tramp steal your fiancé?" Diana snapped. "You should go find that tramp and negotiate."


Leila meekly agreed and left.

By the time Amelia woke up the next morning, Chris was surprisingly already out of bed and in the kitchen preparing breakfast, again.

Amelia was frustrated, thinking her kitchen was probably a mess.

But when she went downstairs, she found he had made spaghetti. It looked odd but smelled decent.

"Try it," he said, a bit smug.

Amelia respected his effort and took a bite,savoring it.
"It's a bit sweet," she said, but it was acceptable.

Chris frowned.

Amelia took a couple more bites and then said, "Sit down. I need to talk to you."


"Finish it first," Chris pointed at the spaghetti, pulling up a chair.


Amelia continued eating as she spoke, "Our relationship is strange. You have your life and your fiancée, and I want to live a free life. But because of you, I've faced a lot of criticism. I don't want to continue like this."

Her tone was calm, as if discussing someone else's story.

Chris's face darkened, "What do you mean?"

"You know exactly what I mean," Amelia said with a faint smile. "Mr.Spencer; we have different perspectives. You can't understand my difficulties. And I don't blame you for that. Just consider these past few days as my kindness. You can leave now."


She was kicking him out again.

What a heartless woman!

"Leila and I are just..."

"I'm not interested in your story. Please leave," Amelia said,growing impatient.

"But I don't want to leave," Chris sneered. "I'm interested in you.What can you do about it? Whether you're Amelia or Bella, you've caught my interest, and you have to see it through."
He was being completely unreasonable.

Amelia took a deep breath, changed her clothes,did her makeup,grabbed her bag, and left, leaving him alone in the house.

When Wendy saw her, she was thrilled, "Ms. White,we sold some paintings yesterday and today. Have you received the transfers?"

Only then did Amelia remember to check her phone and saw a substantial amount of money had been transferred.

"Eighty mnillion dollars? That's insane. Who bought the paintings and paid so much?" Amelia was shocked.


Wendy explained, "It was an overseas client. We communicated via video.He seemed very wealthy. His home is a castle, and the painting on his wall looked like it was worth tens of millions."

"An overseas client?" Amelia froze, a chill running down her spine.

In aflash, she thought of her recent experiences in Celestria.

Could it be those people?

It couldn't be. Larry wouldn't be that generous.

"Yes, and he left a message for you," Wendy said with an innocent smile.

"What did he say?"

"He said, 'Ms. Tudor, we'll meet soon.' I don't know who he is or what he wants, but he kept getting your name wrong."

Amelia stood there,stunned.
She didn't hear a word Wendy said after that.

Until a familiar voice broke through, "Ms. White, what's wrong? Why are you just standing there?"

It was Leila's voice.

Why was Leila here again?

"Sorry, Ms. Ross, our boss isn't feeling well and can't see anyone," Wendy said,knowing Amelia and Leila didn't get along.

Leila retorted, "Do you know your boss is a homewrecker, always interfering in other people's relationships? You better not get a boyfriend,or she might steal him too."
